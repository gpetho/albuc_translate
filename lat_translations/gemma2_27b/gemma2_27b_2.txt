Praefatio.	Preface. 
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I completed for you, O sons, this book, which is the last of medical science with its completion, and I reached the end in it from its expositions and its own statements, it seemed to me fitting to complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery by hand. 
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation by hand is laid low in our region and time completely lost, until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its trace was cut off, and there remained from it nothing except small descriptions in old books, which hands altered, and error and hesitation happened to them until its intentions were closed and its force extended: It seemed fitting to me to revive it with the ordering of this Treatise on it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and to come with forms of instruments of cautery and the rest of the tools for the work; with what is done by addition from declarations and from the celerity of that which is necessary. 
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to practice before that in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the functions of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their emergence, and veins pulsating and quiet, and the places of their exit.  
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And on account of that Hippocrates said, that a name with a name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand. 
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We, however, already said about that at the beginning of this book. 
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not knowing what we said about anatomy, is not purged, but rather falls into error by which men are killed: just as I saw many of those who are formed from this science and boast themselves about it without knowledge, and without experiment. 
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	This happened because I saw a stupid doctor cut open a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and he cut some arteries in her neck: therefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age and the stone was large. 
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore reached him and extracted it with a piece of bladder. 
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day. 
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been called to extract it and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the sick man that he would die.  
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving a fee from a Duke of our land for medicine and it happened that a black eunuch who was with him suffered a fracture in his leg near his heel and the doctor rushed with his ignorance and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong bindings and did not allow the wound to breathe. 
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his wishes. 
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterward he dismissed him after several days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage and it remained so until his leg and foot became abscessed and it came to destruction. 
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him and I hurried to loosen the bandage and tranquility followed and he was freed from his pains. 
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb and I could not restrain it.  
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it died. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess and it became ulcerated afterward until its malice was magnified with its master. 
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor then it should not be reached with iron at all unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it so that its whole mass can be cut off. 
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that an operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, operation which is associated with safety; and operation, with which there is danger in many dispositions. 
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already aroused in every place of this book, in which comes an operation, in which there is terror and fear. 
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to diminish it so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor. 
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore receive measure with solicitude and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy succession: and dismiss terrible illnesses of difficult healing: and lift up your souls from that which makes you fear so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and well-being. 
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more lasting for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.  
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonishments. 
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be named among bad doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now this Treatise has been divided according to three Chapters.  
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One. 
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cautery with fire and cautery with sharp medicine, chaptered and ordered from head to foot, and forms of instruments and tools for cautery; and everything that is necessary in the operation.  
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two. 
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and perforation, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds; and the extraction of arrows, and things similar to it; and all chaptered, ordered according to forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three. 
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of torsion, and things similar to it; chaptered, ordered from head to foot, and according to forms of instruments. 
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.

Pars I.	Part I. 
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the burning and injury of cautery; and to what temperaments it is suitable; and at what time; and whether with iron or gold. 
Caput I.	Chapter I.  
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operations performed with it, it is necessary to say what are its qualities of cauteries and their harms; and in what complexion they should be exhibited. 
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that speech concerning the quality of cautery's benefit and its harm is a lengthy and subtle science, and a hidden secret. 
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Indeed, many wise men have spoken on this subject and disagreed; and it suffices for me a little from their speeches, fearing prolixity. 
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore I say that cautery generally confers benefit to every complexion which has matter and lacks matter, except for two complexions: a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed. 
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cautery is beneficial in it.  
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Others said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in a disease which arises from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat; and it is inconvenient for something hot and dry to heal a disease that is hot and dry. 
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite of that said that cautery brings benefit to every hot and dry disease which occurs in the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold. 
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his speech because experience has now revealed that to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary for one to come upon this unless he has already been proven and practiced in the ultimate exercise of cautery and has recognized the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of diseases within themselves and their causes and accidents, and the space of time of these things. 
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But there is no fear for you from the other temperaments; and especially in cold and humid illnesses. 
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have now agreed upon them, and they did not disagree on healing them with cautery. 
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which you are cauterizing, and it does not harm another joined member with it, except for slight harm. 
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of burning medicine reaches that which is extended from the members and perhaps causes a difficulty in healing to occur in the member, and perhaps it kills it. 
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, on account of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed it has now become clear to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and our standing upon the truth of things; and on account of that I excuse myself from the length of speech. 
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not allowed to this book of mine, I would bring to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with philosophical speech demonstrative, which would be fitting for your minds. 
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they themselves disagree on the time in which it is fitting to perform cautery, and they put forward a better time for truth.  
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is fitting in all time because the harm which happens because of time is submerged in the healing which is attracted with cautery.  
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong ones, urgent ones, which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a greater evil may happen than a slight harm entering because of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not enter your minds, O sons, that which the common and foolish physicians do not believe, namely that for that illness which is healed by cautery, there is not always a return; and they put this as a consequence, but the matter is not as they think; because cautery is nothing but a medicine in its place, which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes why pains occur. 
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its healing, and the power of its operation, and the intensity of its dominion; and it is possible that the illness may return at some hour according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and its power; and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it; and what comes to him in its acquisition from foods, and similar causes, unless the illness arises in which cautery is administered. 
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	An illness subtle in a limb with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth, on account of pain and similar things to it, for it is possible that the pain will not return there.  
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens rarely. 
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine is a right statement: not according to what they intend in it; for they believe that there is no cure which can compare with medicine nor with any other after the cautery has been performed.  
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is the opposite of that, and the intent in which cautery is said to be the last resort of medicine is not, except when we administer modes of treatment in some illnesses, and those medicines do not avail; then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it avails; then it falls that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand. 
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than a cautery with iron; and they did not say this except on account of the equality of gold, and the subtlety of its substance; and they said that it does not produce pus at the site of the cautery. 
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true; for I have already proven it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others. 
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said. 
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you ignite a cautery in fire made of gold, it is not shown to you, when ignited according to the quantity which you wish, because of the redness of the gold; and when cold quickly approaches it, and if you add fire on top of it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets. 
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from it into occupation; and because of that, a cautery with iron is made among us faster and closer, from straightforwardness to operation. 
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have now arranged this chapter on the cautery according to chapters; and I have arranged them from the head down to the feet, so that it may relieve one seeking that which he wants from it. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization pertains to the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain; which are two causes of headache, and a multitude of flows of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally all sickness, which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses to those.  
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The manner of cauterization is that you order the sick person: to evacuate in the first place with cleansing medicine three nights, or four, according to what requires the strength of the infirm person, and his age, and his habit. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then order him to shave his head with a razor. 
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands on a stool, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.  
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. 
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger arrives, mark that place with a cautery. 
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then with an olive-wood cautery: which has this shape.  
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the spot marked with the cautery, descending in such a way that your hand constricts gradually, and you revolve it. 
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly and look at the place. 
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	And if you see that a quantity equal to the head of an alky or a quantity equal to rue has already been exposed from the bone, then lift your hand. 
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it becomes cold: until the bones which I told you are seen. 
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotton wool in it, and place it on the spot; and leave it for three days.  
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place cotton wool soaked in butter on top of it, and leave it on the spot until the burn is destroyed. 
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with tetrapharmakon ointment until it is healed.  
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	It has been said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: therefore it is better and more beneficial. 
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of a bone is charred. 
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then after that which has been charred is scraped off from the bone, then it is cared for.  
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary with the cautery to reach the very end until it imprints a template on the bone so that the bone falls away, which is done like the shape of a kirate: or an instrument which women put in infused with a small alphabet; and they believe that vapors from the head are exhaled from this place and the wound is left open for a long time. 
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be cared for until it is consolidated. 
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me to be anything other than according to the way of fear in certain men. 
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to dismiss him, is better with his health according to me. 
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened from the solution of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head of a weak, feeble person is; and the first kind of cautery is indeed safer and better for me, and I use it; therefore operate with it safely.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head. 
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs in the whole head and it is prolonged in a weak person, and they use leeches, poultices, head-purgatives, oils, and emplasters.  
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and those things do not bring him any relief, then consider. 
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of a weak person is strong by nature and is not feeble, and it encounters severe cold, then cauterize with another cautery under that one a little. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over the whole horn of its head with a cautery, so that it does not pass through the skin, and uncover from the bone a quantity, as we have described.  
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of its head, in the place which is called "vas"; and this place is where the wind is placed; elevate your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone. 
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak person finds because of that severe pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauteries. 
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say this cautery in its place; and it is necessary that it be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head with a more subtle cautery, with which the middle of the head is cauterized. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the way of cauterizing in headache, both with burning medicine and with iron. 
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV. 
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I mentioned in the divisions of diseases, is administered, and it does not fully resolve; then cauterization is appropriate in this case according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine; or with iron. 
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine is done as follows: take one clove of garlic and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. 
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then split the place of pain at a time when bloodletting is broad, until a place under the skin is made where the tooth is taken. 
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore insert it just under the skin until it is concealed; then bind it above with a constriction appropriate for a poultice, and leave it for fifteen hours; then loosen it and remove the garlic; and let it rest for two or three days; afterwards apply a swab dipped in butter over it until the place forms pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed. 
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do so with certain burning medicines, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines. 
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron is done as follows.  
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Heat the cautery, whose shape is this. 
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a cautery iron because the shape of its head is like the shape of a key, which has some curvature and in the middle of it there is a small prominence. 
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it upon the location and hold your hand steady; and turn the iron gradually with speed; and the amount that is cauterized should be half of the thickness of the skin. 
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery which is below is not injured and bleeding may occur. 
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a compress in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days; then place the compress with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed. 
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemi cranium with the second point of the cautery. 
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting an artery in this hemi cranium, not an old one properly. 
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an old hemi cranium.
Caput V.	Chapter Five. 
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a hemi cranium with what we said from the previous treatment and what we said in the divisions of diseases and the treatment does not work; and you see from the illness that it is not sufficient for it what we said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you ignite the knife cautery until it becomes white after you mark a line on the spot of pain whose length is half a finger, or so; and place your hand with one finger, and press it until you strike the artery and reach up to the mouth. 
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the mandible, which moves during chewing, lest its side or the nerve that moves it be injured, from which a spasm may occur. 
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be watchful and careful about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut. 
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting off there is fear, and especially for him who does not know that which he is doing, and is neither studious nor experienced; and he abandons the operation with it at first. 
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a recollection of the regimen of the flow of blood occurring from an artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the weak person enduring the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, care for the wound until it heals. 
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two knives. 
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more effective. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the manner of cauterizing for ear pain. 
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold and is treated with solutions and the remaining treatment as we have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply a cautery by fire. And this is what is called a Point, its shape is as follows.  
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then points with it after its ignition are made in a circle around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circle around both, if there is pain in both at the same time. 
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And distance yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with an ointment; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten punctures in each ear, and like that. 
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the places until they heal. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the manner of cauterizing for a sprain.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	A sprain that is treated with cautery is only of the types that occur from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cautery for types that occur from dryness and nerve spasm. 
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of sprain with herbs, poultices, and gargles, and your treatment does not take effect, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below its temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery opposite the weak part. 
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not happen unless in the part which appears healthy. 
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, to cauterize it with the cautery itself in a straight line from the upper extremity of the ear below the horn of the head a little; and at another time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb. 
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until a quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned. 
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind from the one with a blade, whose form was mentioned before; however it is not thinner by a little, as you see; and it should be that the knife in it has unnecessary thickness a little.  
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the places, with what preceded, until they are healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the manner of cauterizing in old apoplexy.  
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight. 
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes old, and you care for it with what we said, and your medication does not help, and the weak person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries above all the horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded; and let the manner of the cautery be according to what preceded.  
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also cauterize with a cautery above the mouth of the stomach: and it is more final. 
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for it, with what preceded. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the manner of cauterizing in Oblivion. 
Caput IX.	Chapter Nine.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that first the weak person be given a large quantity of hyssop and pills that purify the brain. 
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the weak person completely and place on the back of his head a plaster of sycamore as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	Indeed, this is the method of cautery; and do that in the same order as I said there. 
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	Therefore if it heals thereby, it is good. 
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then do three cauteries on the back of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and put the breadth of a finger between each cautery. 
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the cautery, as with the one that preceded it.  
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you wish an addition, and he is able to tolerate it; then do a cautery for him in the middle. 
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	And if you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was mentioned previously.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening. 
Caput X.	Chapter Ten. 
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed with the purification of the head with hyssop and with what we have said.  
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery above the back of it, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck. 
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are dealing with illness in softening of the body with more than those, and he is able to tolerate it, and the illness is strong; then cautery him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery until most of it is burned from the skin, and raise your hand. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him until he is healed; and thus let the cautery be olive-shaped.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the method of cauterying in epilepsy. 
Caput XI.	Chapter Eleven.  
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized unless his epilepsy is from phlegm. 
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary that you cleanse his brain first of all with vinegar, and with the remaining treatment which we mentioned in the division: when he is strong, or when he can bear taking medicines. 
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a child who cannot bear medicines, then a gargle and cleaning mastications for the brain are given before it, for many days with good food. 
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, and afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner; and with another cautery on the back of his head, and with a cautery over all the horn of his head. 
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if the sick person is strong and can bear it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-oil according to the manner which preceded. 
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if the sick person is a child then put a delicate cautery according to this manner.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	Concerning the Manner of Cauterizing in Melancholy. 
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the one having paralysis.  
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy and the body of the sick person is damp, then give him a drink which will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a well-shaped turband out of linen, like a circle. 
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of his head; and the sick person sitting straight should be held on all sides.  
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present a liniment. 
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more fitting to be made from old butter. 
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with a tempered heat, which the finger can bear when introduced into it.  
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let it alone until it becomes cold. 
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do that to the weak one once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed. 
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures on it, except where you hold it with the cautery: let there be a smell.  
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality. 
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put a swab soaked in butter or chicken fat on top of it.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the manner of cauterizing descending to the eye in water. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter Thirteen.  
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have said in the division, then begin and make the weak one drink, with that which cleanses his head.  
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him from all moistures, and have him sit in a bath, fasting for several days. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his own head.  
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it above the two temples with two cauteries, if there is a beginning of the descent of water in both eyes at the same time; or from one side, if there is a beginning of water in one eye; and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin; and let the cautery be long in width above the temples; and beware of the flow of blood. 
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	For if you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and the cutting off of them and caution from the flow of blood. 
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries lastly produced.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the manner of cauterizing old tears. 
Caput XIIII.	Chapter Fourteen. 
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When tears of the eyes are old, persistent, and are upon the veins and arteries which are on the outer surface of the head, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under two bones. 
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it does not yield with addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously above the eye, upon the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing for a foul smell of the nose.  
Caput XV.	Chapter Fifteen. 
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with that which we said in the division, and medication does not avail, then hasten and give in a draught three nights of infirmocochias; then shave its head and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-wood cautery. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a small cautery, with two cauteries on the two eyebrows a little under the hairs. 
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And guard against the artery so as not to strike it.  
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of a small cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Concerning the method of cauterizing for relaxation of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen. 
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye becomes relaxed from illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with a moon-shaped cautery. 
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side; and let them be extended from the two temples; and let the length of the whole cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow; and do not finish your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned. 
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the shape of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the way of cauterizing an eyelid when prickly hairs are turned inwards and irritate the eye. 
Caput XVII.	Chapter Seventeen. 
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	A cautery is of two types: either a cautery with fire or a cautery with a burning medicine. 
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	However, in a fire cautery, advise the patient beforehand to let their hairs grow out, if they are among those who remove them, until they are lengthened and even. 
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they sting him at their root, then bind his eyes with a strip so that they do not move until they are born. 
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	Therefore, when they are born and even, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with wax, a mark that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.  
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place cotton soaked in albumin or in psyllium mucilage over the eye. 
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then with fire a cautery, whose shape is this.  
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape which you have marked gradually in many times until the surface of the skin which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned properly. 
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and the hairs rising at the puncture of the eye. 
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore, raise your hand then, and let him go for three days.

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed. 
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	And if any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery over that place as you did at first.  
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If, however, the hairs are on the lower eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place; and make it even so that the hairs do not prick the eye. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case. 
Caput XVIII.	Chapter Eighteen. 
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you should direct the sick person to let the hairs grow out until they are lengthened and even. 
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from paper or cloth a shape of a myrtle leaf. 
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from lime not imbibed from each one weight of one ounce or nearly that; then grind them together with good attrition and make it quickly so that it does not become cold.  
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from the pan spread it upon the paper which you have made like a myrtle leaf shape and place it upon the eyelid of one or both eyes. 
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a piece of cloth soaked in albuminous fluid; and let the head of the sick person be in your lap.  
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger upon the medicine and press it for a short time. 
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you will move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine; because it finds its bite like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he perseveres in this, that he finds the bite, then let go of the medicine and move it with your finger. 
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the bite quiets, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.  
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then if you see the eyelid being raised as it is raised with fire or incision, it is well; and if not, then repeat upon it from the medicine upon the place where the medicine does not imprint and does not stain until your operation is equal and the eye contracts. 
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it a cloth with butter until the skin burn is eradicated. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphinicon ointment or another until it heals. 
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during surgery, that you guard with the utmost care, lest anything from the medicine should fall into the eye. 
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after a few days and something from the hairs fights its way into the eye, then repeat the medicine upon that place which softens from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals. 
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.  
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and equality. 
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore let your consideration be according to that, and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a desire concerning this art. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in lacrimal fistula.  
Caput XIX.	Chapter Nineteen. 
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you heal a fistula, as we said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not work: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method. 
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the sick person to put his head in your lap, and let a servant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head. 
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over his eye; then with fire a cautery, whose form is this. 
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture’s quill pen from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish for it to penetrate all the way to the other end, and if you wish for it to go upward, then try thus. 
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However this concave shape is better for your purpose.  
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then press out the fistula if it is open and extract the pus from it and dry it out; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery upon it, which has been heated intensely. 
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it a little while by the cautery from the eye, to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not stray, or the weak one is not disturbed: and you place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it. 
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	So if you reach in the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, it will be well. 
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if it is necessary with it: and dismiss it for three days. 
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place cotton with butter, and care for it with a drying ointment until it is healed.  
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	And if forty days pass it and it does not heal: then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine until the mouth is uncovered: and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.  
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cautery for fistula, which some first said. 
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Attend to the place of the fistula, and find it: then put a thin camahan into the fissure, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this. 
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of a drachma from melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula in good retention, and do not move the weak one at all so that the melted lead does not run or reach its eye. 
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place cotton infused in albumin, yes, or in water upon the eye of the weak one.  
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing. 
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we said from cautery and care, it is good.  
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nostril, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come in its own place.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Very often there occur in the lip fissures which are called harelips, and especially in the lips of infants. 
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore when you treat these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then a small heated knife cautery, according to this form. 
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the knife.  
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the heated cautery quickly in the fissures themselves until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with cerate until it heals.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the manner of cauterizing a fistula of the mouth. 
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it makes pus and bursts: afterwards it becomes chronic and discharges pus and a fistula forms: then you treat it and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary to apply a heated cautery according to the size which will fit into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the heated iron into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end: do this once or twice.  
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then care for it afterwards with what we said about care until it is healed. 
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the discharge is cut off and it heals, it will be good.  
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupt bone according to what will come in its chapter. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the manner of cauterizing the gums and softened teeth.

When the gum softens because of moisture and the teeth are loosened and you treat it with medication and it does not help: then place the head of the weak person in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then a cautery by fire, whose form will come after this, so that you put the Cannula over the tooth; and insert into it the ignited Cautery quickly: and hold your hand for a short time, until the weak one feels the heat of the fire has now reached the root of the tooth. 
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	Then raise your hand; then repeat the Cautery several times, according as you wish. 
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the weak one fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour; and spit it out. 
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth moved is made firm, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the way of cauterizing in Toothache. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter Twenty-Three.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the pain of a tooth is because of coldness, or there is cold itself in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help; then the Cautery is upon it according to two ways: either Cautery with butter; or cautery with fire. 
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But the Cautery of it with butter is, so that you take vaccinated butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a crucible. 
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take cotton, and wrap it over the end of the tentacle. 
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then dip it into the boiling butter; and put it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, dip wool, or cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth; and put ignited iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth. 
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But cautery with fire is, so that you apply to a cannula of air, or a cannula of iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the weak one. 
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply a cautery iron, the shape of which will be shown; and place it upon that tooth; and hold your hand there until the cautery iron cools. 
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Repeat this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on the same day or another day. 
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary that after the impression of the cautery iron, the sick person should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then spit it out. 
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery iron. 
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.

When fistulas are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you wish to hasten their digestion; then apply a concave cautery iron, the shape of which is this. 
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities so that the smoke may escape from the cautery iron at one extremity; and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time if needed, until it reaches the depth of the abscess. 
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	But if the abscess is small, then place the cautery iron according to the size of the abscess. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place a poultice soaked in butter upon it until what was burned by the fire is removed. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment until the shape of the cannula is healed.

When humors overcome the bronchial tubes, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the sick person first be evacuated with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at night near the root of the throat in a depressed place, and beware that you do not reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin except for a little bit of it. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck on the last vertebra, ending it. And let the cautery be small according to the previous way.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing in illnesses of the lung and cough.  
Caput XXVI.	Chapter Twenty-Six. 
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When a cough and lung ailment are from cold humors, and the weak person does not have a fever nor phthisis, and the ailment is old: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, smooth, empty places.  
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be like a cannula according to the previous form. 
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cautery to be by pricking with a cautery which is called a Point, whose form preceded in the cauterization of ear pain: and let there be points from thirty points up to others.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what precedes until he is healed. 
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches according to this form.  
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore cauterization is relieved when you do it with that juice along with three cauteries. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing in a twitching, in dislocation of the shoulder. 
Caput XXVII.	Chapter Twenty-Seven.  
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to humors, and it does not stay fixed within an hour of its return from its dislocation until a habit of returning is established, then afterwards it is dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified: then it is necessary for you to first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the weak person is laid on his back, or on his sound side. 
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then raise the skin which is inside the nipple upwards with your left hand's fingers and if the joint dislocates inwards.

Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three points, therefore the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries and the points are tested according to subtlety.  
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of a cautery having three points. 
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one more is added in this manner so there are eight cauteries.

Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the weak person adhere to quiet so that the limb is not moved for a time until it is strengthened.  
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or by puncturing with many cauteries. 
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed and the weak person is healed.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach. 
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and much humidity happen in the stomach until they draw it away from its complexion and multiply catarrh to it and constant modes of treatment and do not help then it is necessary that the weak person be laid on his back and extend his legs and arms.  
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a clavicle cautery, and two cauteries below from both sides of the one cautery until there comes a triangular figure of cauteries. 
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each so they do not join together when they form pus. 
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin. 
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cautery is made be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form. 
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it for one who is afraid of this cautery: and it is, that you sign on the stomach a point according to the amount which you wish with an encaustic: then cauterize it itself with a point cautery: then care for it with the care which preceded until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Concerning the way of cauterizing a cold epar.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter Twenty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens in the epar that pain arises from coldness and humidity, or from thick windiness until superfluous egress departs from its own natural complexion, and the infirm is cured with what we said, and does not progress in it: then it is necessary that the infirm be laid on their back on their neck, and signs with an encaustic three cauteries according to this form, and this same quantity above the epar below the hypochondria where the elbow of a man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not compress your hand much with the cautery. 
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what is burned from the thickness of the skin be the quantity of half of it not added to: and let the infirm person stand on their own feet.  
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.  
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of a cautery. 
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize with this cautery using a knife cautery when you have subtlety and prudence in the art. 
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed too far in cauterization and the thickness of all the skin is hardened, therefore the whole body is hardened and it reaches the intestines; for the skin there is subtle, know therefore that. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses. 
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a weak pain and heaviness occur without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is sharp vehemence with pain; and you see now that his treatment has wearied his doctors. 
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore it is necessary for the sick person to lie on his neck. 
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the place of the abscess with wax; then heat a cautery which resembles a ray. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one time until all the skin is burned and it reaches the underlying tissue, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with treatment for ulcers until it is healed. 
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary to use this species of cautery except by one whose study in the medical art is prolonged and through whose hands these kinds of illnesses concur many times with experiment; then let him dare to perform this type of operation. 
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly it is better for me to leave it.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing pleurisy. 
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-one.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said to cauterize cold pleurisy with a cautery using the roots of birthwort in this way. 
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	Take one longer root from the dried long roots of aristolochia, and let it be as thick as a finger. 
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in fire. 
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck, and with two small cauteries a little below the guidezi towards the part under the beard. 
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib a little below towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. 
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.  
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to compress your hand with the cautery, rather let it be evident on the skin by smelling. 
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And certain ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a spoke; they ignite it and insert it into that which is between the ribs until they reach the abscess with it, and pus flows out as we said in the abscess of the liver.  
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear, that either the weak one dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no healing. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter Thirty-Two.  
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat a spleen ailment, as we said in the treatment of divisions of diseases and your treatment does not work, then there is a cautery for it according to three methods, all of which are correct. 
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three or four cauteries in a line according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of liver cauteries, the figure of which precedes.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cautery a quantity of the thickness of a finger, or more or less. 
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cautery, which we have said in cautery of the liver be equally.  
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the weak patient be supine on his back. 
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: to have the cautery with two true points of fire, as we said in the chapter of shoulder dislocation: and elevate the skin which is directly over the spleen where the left elbow of the weak patient reaches: and let your elevation be such that you elevate the skin according to the width of the body so that the cauteries may fall according to the length of the body. 
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce the two points ignited deeply, until with them you penetrate the skin on the other side: then withdraw the cautery: thus there are made four cauteries. 
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three points.  
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you have dismissed it to discharge pus for many days: for it is more bringing together than any other which preceded from the cure. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterizing in dropsy.  
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter thirty-three. 
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	A cautery does not fall in dropsy unless on the legs properly. 
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsy with the methods of cure which we have said in the division, and the cure does not bring together then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery over the stomach, and another cautery over the liver, and one over the spleen, and two cauteries down the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the quantity of depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.  
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then dismiss the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time. 
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not withhold the weak from treatment after cautery with him, for it is necessary that two intentions be brought together for him, and healing will hasten to him with the help of God. 
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	But the form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be clauilis, according to its previous form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing feet and legs.  
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four. 
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses form in dropsy and are filled with clear water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot at the nocrati, which is between the auricular and annular bones; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand and do not rub it at all. 
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the clear water will redden, and the cautery should be of this form. 
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizations on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the blade end of the cautery; and let the cauterization be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below it, about the middle of the leg; and make two cauterizations on each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time so that some water may redden from it; then treat it with the rest as we have said.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing in the resolution of the abdomen. 
Caput XXXV.	Chapter Thirty-Five.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a resolution of the abdomen from cold and moisture until the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and it is treated with modes of treatment and does not heal, and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of abundant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four slender cauteries in the circumference of the umbilicus, with a slender clauilis cautery; and a cautery above the groin above the ilium with a large one or two.  
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant moistures and a weak patient enduring it, then cauterize it with a cautery over the comb, and with a cautery over the whole groin; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries on the abdomen near the large one. 
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial cure, whose benefit does not stray. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids. 
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six. 
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids or one in the anus, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humidities, and they are cured with what we said in the division, and the cure does not avail; then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower lumbar vertebra under the armpit a little triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers. 
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded; and with a cautery over his liver, and another over his spleen with a clauile cautery; and leave the cautery open for a time: then care for him until he is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the Method of Cauterizing Atherlomas after Their Excision.  
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter Thirty-Seven. 
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise atherlomas, then heat a cautery that resembles a rod.  
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited one into the excised atherloma; and with your last hand until it reaches the orifice of the vein from which blood runs; do that once or twice. 
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many atherlomas, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have described.  
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed. 
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more final for healing. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the Manner of Cauterizing a Fistula in the Anus. 
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight. 
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not submit to incision and the work which we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery. 
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore when it happens to someone that a fistula has become old, and pus runs from it, and corrupt humors. 
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore more fitting that which is necessary, so that you should test it with a delicate probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of it with the probe. 
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then ignite a cautery which is similar to a spoke. 
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself ignited into the fistula and the quantity into which the peg entered.  
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery over it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your need. 
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if it is there, or a large vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestines, then guard yourself from all these places. 
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you consider that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals. 
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed and materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time, then you will know that it has now been completely healed.  
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials are not cut away from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupt opening deep within it, or as if it were one of those, the recollection of which will come in its place. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the Manner of Cauterizing the Kidneys.  
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX. 
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold, or from thick windiness, and the strength of the sick person is diminished because of it, then it is necessary to cauterize him above the navel, above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over the whole kidney with a clauili cautery, of which mention was made previously. 
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize him a second time in the very navel.  
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore, three lines will come. 
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they will be better for relief.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the bladder. 
Caput XL.	Chapter XL. 
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, until the sick person does not retain urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the penis above the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and with a cautery from the right side of the penis, and another from the left: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the size of a knuckle; and cauterize him with a cautery below the back, or with two cauteries if he needs them; and let it be as mentioned previously, a clauili cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the womb.  
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI. 
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and dampness occur in the womb, and because of it impregnation is prohibited, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the hip below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be clauili. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation. 
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII. 
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humors are poured out to the Anchae bone and become the cause of its displacement from its place; and the sign thereof is that one leg is lengthened over the other when they are compared together; and the place of dislocation is found empty in it. 
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the weak bone of the Anchae itself with a cautery like a circle; after you have marked with an encaustic in a circle around the bone, as it revolves; and so that the bone itself falls in the middle of the circle. 
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of such a form as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach. 
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	And if you do not have this cautery present, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-wood cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of the whole. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica. 
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43. 
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the Anchae bone, and its cause is cold and humors; and the weak person is cured with what we said in the division, and the cure does not take effect, and it becomes old; then it is necessary that you free the weak person from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and the like. 
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him. 
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.  
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many methods. 
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize over the Anchae bone itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form. 
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good or bad.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space which is between each cautery be of the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be olive-wood. 
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, a cautery is made in the middle above the head of the wound itself. 
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries. 
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes in the cauterization of a wide dislocation, with one: so that it is a circle containing the whole wound. 
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of all the skin. 
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the wound itself and does not extend as far as the hip and leg. 
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends as far as the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the weakling points there, in which there is pain, and your cautery above the calf four fingers towards the woodland side a little: and let the cautery be sharp. 
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin. 
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the weakling points out that the pain extends as far as near the toes, then cauterize it there where he points with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if he needs it. 
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he points out the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cautery it there with one sharp cautery.  
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware for yourself in all your cauteries, that you do not finish with the cautery so as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and draw through it upon the weakling a bad harm, or contraction. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have now seen one and another, from those who have cauterized above the calf, and finished in the cautery, and the leg swelled up until a tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated all through, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a rupture of the abdomen, and death after that. 
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in both parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method. 
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men said that in the cauterization of a wide area, which cautery is of this mode. 
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a cautery like a samarium iron, whose diameter is half a palm; and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a fingernail, or a little less: and within that samarium let there be a third samarium.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between every samarium be by the quantity of a thumb joint; and let the samaria be open on two sides; and let the height of them be like a thumb joint, or two thumb joints; and make for them a handle from iron suitably fitted into the samaria. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then ignite it in fire until it glows and projects sparks; then place it on a wide layer of pitch with the infirm person lying down on their healthy side. 
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three circular cauteries in one spot.  
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him go for three days. 
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply a plaster with butter; and let the wound open for many days.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals. 
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, of this kind of cautery, O my son, we have used but little, because of the terror of its appearance; and therefore, because we found few who would endure it. 
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless it is one of the good cauteries for him who suffers it, and finds with it its place.  
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	This cautery however with medicines that harden is, for you to make two samaria having a perforated armilla, into which the bolt of its door descends from brass or iron, the length of a span; whose height shall be two thumb joints, or almost like them.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there shall be a space which is between each quantity of the thickness of a finger, and they shall be open below and above; and let them contain themselves to each other, according to this form. 
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then lay it upon the pillow, the weak one lying on his sound side. 
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand upon the broad pillow greatly. 
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire a little while, and hold it for the space of an hour; and let the weak one endure its biting and its burning, for he finds the bite like fire until the bite subsides.  
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the whole pillow with sweet water; then let it alone for three days. 
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter upon it until the blackness of the burning is removed; and let it alone for several days, and let pus flow from it. 
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the final thing in healing. 
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it heals.  
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends as far as the hip or the leg: make for him a bath that contains water according to what you did for the pillow equally. 
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.  
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, of each a half part; grind each one and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with one small hole according to the quantity that enters the radius; and put under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot; and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water, which shall submerge each by a finger; after which you shall press them with your hand with good compression; and let the pot stand until sharp water descends to the lower part of the glazed pot. 
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add all that water and pour it over other lime; and strain until it is renewed.  
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It will then indeed be very sharp and strong, which is used in many medical operations and for cauterizing the remaining limbs. 
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it makes the operation of fire itself effective. 
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medicines are those with which anchas are cauterized, even as tesisie and mastic, and lime with soap, so that both may be mixed together. 
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed recounted the cure of a certain man from antiquity, who was cured of pain in the ancha and sciatic vein; and he praised it greatly. 
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he needed no other treatment and that he was healed by one application only, until he recounted that he perhaps entered a bath carried in and came out of it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, take the dry, fresh one; and knead it well with a little fat and place it on the ancha where there is pain, or the leg, or in the hip; and bind it up, and leave it for three hours, or for as long as the weak person feels the soothing of the burning. 
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into a bath. 
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body is warmed, place him on a couch. 
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain subsides and he heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no one should use a cautery with these medicines except after evacuation of the body. 
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who also said that goat dung when it is cauterized with the sciatic vein, strengthens it; and the cautery is made in this way. 
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool and soak it in old oil and place it on the deep spot which is between the big toe and the other toes and which is closer to the other toes. 
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon wool and let it remain until it is extinguished. 
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that. 
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease to do that until sensation reaches the region of the neck by means of mediation and pain ceases. 
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called cautery vaccinum.  
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cauterization of back pain. 
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter Forty-four.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and suchlike, from infusion of cold and humid matter; and cautery indeed does not apply except in this one kind which is caused by infusion of cold matter. 
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is therefore necessary after evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills and suchlike, so that they are made upon the back, where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the almeidia itself, after making signs with a hot iron on each line five cauteries or more according to the quantity which comes from the tolerance of the strength of the sick person; and let the cauterization be done with a puncturing cautery. 
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four with a medium-sized clavil cautery according to this form. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in incipient gibbosity.  
Caput XLV.	Chapter Forty-five. 
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	Very often this illness happens to young infants.  
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its inception in children is: a constriction occurs upon him in breathing at elevation and motion; and the youth in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore when you see that, and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. 
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let him apply the cautery over every part of the vertebrae equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cautery two lines, or three. And let the points be near to each other. 
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place until it heals with what we have said. 
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware that you do not apply the cautery in a gibbosity which occurs in nerve spasm. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing in gout and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter Forty-Six.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which flow to any limb of the body, then when they happen in the feet, it is customary for physicians to name that gout properly. 
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of treatment and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that you cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-wood. 
Cuius haec est forma.	Of which this is the form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if it seems necessary to you to make points on the face of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. 
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend as far as the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him over the whole knee with three or four cauteries on all sides with the same olive-wood cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if more of these cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only. 
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we have said from the cautery in its own chapter. 
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands then make points around the wrists as they turn like two lines.  
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, a point over every knuckle and a point over the comb of the hand. 
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains rise after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both on every side. 
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not withdraw the weak from a good regimen, from the taking of medicines. 
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God along with this cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the manner of cauterizing in ruptures.  
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or omentum descends to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary that you advise the sick man to cease eating on his day of fasting. 
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives so that the dung descends from his belly. 
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands upon his back and instruct him to hold his breath until it emerges or the omentum or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers and mark with hot wax beneath the rupture on the bone of the hip with a sign whose extremity is like half a circle toward the upper part of the body. 
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply a cautery iron, which has this shape, until it becomes white and throws sparks.  
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then return the intestine or omentum to its cavity. 
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand over the spot so that the intestine does not come out and you have already opened between the sick man's thighs and placed a cushion beneath him, and one servant over his thighs and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery upon the very mark, your hand with the cautery standing straight. 
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach a bone with it; or repeat it with another cautery if you have not reached a bone with the first one up to the bone. 
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterization so that you do not burn it, and death or great harm comes through it upon the sick person. 
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach a bone with the cautery, your operation is of no effect.  
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be slender according to their measure. 
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the remaining ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed. 
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you give them nourishment for the length of their healing time, which soothes their stomach so that the intestine does not come out during straining and excretion. 
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when they wish to rise after forty days, then apply a bandage well made and let them wear it for another forty days.  
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And they should abstain from labor, and the fullness of food and drink, and loud voices. 
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when they use this regimen, they are healed with complete healing.  
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure of ruptures with an incision in its own chapter. 
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly and they are beginning, and you wish that they not be added to, then cauterize their rupture with a round cautery according to its size; and let that which is burned be from then on like a third of it.  
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it as we have said, and it will not be added to. 
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And indeed some of the first have said: that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.  
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a cautery and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. 
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a hot iron. 
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the cautery first is easier and better. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the way of cauterizing in pains because of a fall, or a blow. 
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII. 
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in certain limbs from a fall, or a blow pain: and that pain persists for a long time, and healing does not occur in it with medicine: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a point cautery.  
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of every limb be a cautery according to its size, and its suitability, and its weakness, and its power, and the location of the twist, and the pain from it. 
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	Therefore if it is healed from the first cautery, it is well.  
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cautery upon it. 
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is customary for these pains to change from one limb to that which is close to it.  
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery until the weak one is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the way of cauterizing in leprosy.  
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX. 
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Those with leprosy are sometimes greatly helped by cauterization. 
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy which is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it consider.  
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	Therefore if the leprosy is beginning and you have treated it with what we said in the division and it does not descend nor stand still: and you fear for the sick person that corruption may spread over their whole complexion: then cauterize them on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally impress your hand with a cautery for a short time, until it makes a slight impression on the mouth, and the barks are loosened from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors is relieved from it, and also cauterize the spleen itself with a cautery, as previously mentioned. 
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if leprosy is already spread over the sick person and appears manifestly, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries, which we mentioned in the head, and with a cautery on the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries on the two maxillas, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the alhosos at the base of the tail and one above it, on itself in the almeidati: and two on the anchas: namely, on every ancha with one, and two on the knees: one on every knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the tenderness of his chest. And cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the focilia of his hands. 
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be careful of the nerves that are on the last part of the heel so as not to burn them.  
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the breastbone, and another on the stomach bone, and another on the liver. 
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add a cautery, the more benefit there is, and the more it brings together.  
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as healthy people do: because his body is already stunned. 
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: as previously mentioned from the types of instruments.  
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cautery with flour of herbs and honey, and other care, until it is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the manner of cauterizing in a state of stupor. 
Caput L.	Head L. 
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is in a state of stupor and it is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it does not heal, then cauterize the stupefied limb with cauteries, according to the size or smallness of the limb. 
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery be thrust into the thickness of the skin a little. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals. 
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain stupor which happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb; and the stupor is removed. 
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume upon this unless he is wise in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves that move the body.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the manner of cauterizing in albaras. 
Caput LI.	Head LI. 
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When an albara becomes old and nothing from the arts of medicine takes effect in it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a little while, according to the amount of thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with flour of herbs and lentils with rose oil and leaves of arnoglossa and dove's blood and swallow's blood: let there be one part of each; mix all these things together and spread them upon a cloth and apply them to the place until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the manner of cauterizing in Cancer.  
Caput LII.	Head LII. 
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When a cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery all around it, as if it were revolving.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men, however, have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.  
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it does not seem right to me; for I fear that it might be injured; and I have already seen that happen many times. 
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an adubelati.  
Caput LIII.	Chapter Fifty-Three. 
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an adubelati and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excessive discharge making it so, or because of the weakness due to age, when they are elderly and have little blood, or because of time and the desire to hasten the maturation of the adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing. 
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it alone. 
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten to maturity itself.  
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then use a fire-cautery which has this shape. 
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the adubelati until it penetrates the skin, and let the cautery be weak following this one so that the course of pus is relieved.  
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a malignant corrosive.  
Caput LIIII.	Chapter Fifty-Four.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive is nothing but a corruption in a limb that wanders and eats it away, just as fire consumes dry wood.  
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	Therefore if you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a fire cautery then use many fire cauteries, small and large, according to what suits the place where the corrosive is. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption and nothing remains of it at all.  
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let it alone for three days and place powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized areas until all the scabs and all corruption are eradicated.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with ointments that generate flesh. 
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	So if you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good. 
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remained from the corrupt places.  
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine when corroding. 
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it arises in place of the cautery. 
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	But cautery with fire is of quicker healing; and I have indeed already said cauterization of it with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore take that there when it is needed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the way of cauterizing warts and moles.  
Caput LV.	Chapter Fifty-five.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Very often this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, filtered thing which harms the foot.  
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery indeed in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water. 
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	But as much as with fire, that the cautery be concave like a vulture's quill; which should be made of iron according to the quantity it contains of warts from every part and have subtle edges.  
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it ignited upon the wart. 
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then revolve your hand with the cautery around the wart until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart; and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a plaster with wild mallows crushed with salt; and leave the plaster upon it at night. 
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.  
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are unconverted and very often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet; then administer to them cautery with hot water; and it is that you take a cannula from bronze, or iron, or from a vulture's quill; and place it upon the wart, or althelul. 
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand, and revolve it with pressure from your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula is imprinted on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way deep down to the root of the nail; and let the patient wait for a little while above the bite of the hot water for an hour. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then dismiss him, for the nail will be extracted with its roots. 
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this one by one until you come to all of them that are in the body. 
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are extracted with that which produces flesh from ointments.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing in a tremor. 
Caput LVI.	Chapter Fifty-Six. 
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that a tremor occurs from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or some other cause: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra a cautery, and one on his chest, and one on his stomach. 
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the tremor subsides with an olive-wood cautery, and hastens the healing of a cold illness.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing Albathir. 
Caput LVII.	Chapter Fifty-Seven. 
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul Albathir are expelled from the body, that is, pustules which are made from corrupted thick humors.  
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they first appear, it is necessary that they are cauterized over the entire head of the pustule with a fine cautery made from myrtle wood, whose tip is ignited with fire. 
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with a long aristolochia root.   
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.  
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method; and they do not grow larger; and the excess is broken down making them, and they are healed from them. 
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must be done after evacuation with bloodletting. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing arterial bleeding in a wound. 
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII. 
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Very often it happens that blood flows from an artery which has been cut at a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or a cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to stop it. 
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it hard until the blood is blocked under your finger, and nothing comes out from it. 
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place a small olive-wood cautery in the fire and many more of a large number: and blow upon them until they become very hot.  
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one from them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and apply the cautery upon it, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the bleeding is stopped. 
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	And if it is expelled when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those which are prepared in the fire. 
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease to do that with one after another until the bleeding is stopped.  
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve which is there, and cause other harm to befall the weak patient. 
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it: especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods. 
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.  
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction when it has not been extracted. 
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities are contracted and the bleeding is stopped.  
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it should be tied with a strong ligature. 
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medications of a kind that stanch blood be placed upon it, and let it be compressed with a decent ligature. 
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who performs its excision with a ligature, and constriction with cloth, or the application of burning agents, and similar things, does not thoroughly heal it except rarely. 
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if it should happen to someone and there is neither a physician present nor medicine: then let him begin by placing the index finger upon the orifice of the vein itself, as we have described, and constrict it tightly until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.  
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let the finger not be removed, but constantly apply cold water of intense coldness over it until the blood congeals and thickens, and is cut off. 
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider what he needs from cautery or medicine.  
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	End of the First Part. 
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Second Part of the Surgical Book by Albucasis. 
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Things. 
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the First Chapter that every ailment in which it is fitting to use fire for cautery and burning medicine, its occasions, its causes, its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. 
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed there chapters from head to foot.  
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter the same way, so that it may relieve the inquirer seeking his question. 
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to know, O son, that in this chapter there is terror from what is in the First Chapter on cauterization. 
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And on account of that it is necessary that there be more intense caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and things similar to these: from all of which association trembling and fear arise, and death falls upon many of them. 
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest it fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes there fall upon you in this art ways of men with ways of infirmities. 
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who becomes angry with his illness, and death is light to him because of the violence he finds from his infirmity and the length of his malice.  
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness there is fear which signifies death. 
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives you his lute player and enriches you with him, hoping for healing, and his illness is pernicious. 
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.  
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be stronger than your desire and your greed. 
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume anything from him unless after certain knowledge which verifies with you that which has come to a laudable outcome. 
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the care of all your sick, prognosis and indication concerning it so that health may suitably come about. 
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that there is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.  
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire in you his understanding, and not take away from you direction and inspiration for it is in his hand.  
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed arranged this chapter distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Caustic, from the neck down to the feet so that what you desire and need from it may be relieved for you. 
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of water which collects in the heads of infants.  
Caput I.	Chapter I.  
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this infirmity often happens to boys at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the boy without ease. 
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens also from a hidden cause which is not known.  
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this illness in anyone but children, and death hastened to all of them whom I saw: therefore it seemed best to me to forgo operating on it. 
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself saw a boy from them whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died. 
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed either gathers between the skin and bone or gathers beneath the bone upon the suture. 
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on that, if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and it is a small abscess, then it is necessary that you make a single fissure in the middle of the head one finger wide: and let the length of the fissure be about two knuckles, until the moisture runs out. 
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula. 
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is greater and the abscess is larger, then make those two fissures according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side: and water is depressed when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary that you make three fissures in the middle of the head according to this manner. 
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision extract all the moisture. 
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with cloths and lint. 
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then embrocate it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. 
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and heal the wound with tents and ointments. 
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to bind the head evenly.  
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person with all dry food of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed. 
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears and the collection of water. 
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes there is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left. 
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with an incision where you see the abscess and filling of water; and split it according to what is possible for you. 
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe that you do not cut into an artery and that a flow of blood occurs, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture. 
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears. 
Caput II.	Chapter II. 
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When it happens to someone that there are catarrs to the eyes, or to the chest, and it becomes old, and treatment with medicine does not help; then the final treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries. 
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore it is necessary that when you wish to cut into them, that the sick person should shave their head.  
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear. 
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the sick person tighten their neck with any cloth of theirs.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses. 
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are places which are behind the ears depressed: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with hot wax over each one; and cut both with a scalpel on both sides, the incision reaching the mouth; and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision. 
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood comes out with a throbbing flow which leaps to the insides by frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear a distance of three fingerbreadths. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with hot wax and cut upwards to the mouth. 
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will emit more, or less from it. 
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the weak person and the repletion of their artery.  
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound. 
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the mouth of the wound from the incision, then cut that out so that a hot abscess may not occur; then bind the wound with lint from linen cloth.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals. 
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.  
Caput III.	Chapter III. 
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that an old hemicrania, or acute catarrh occurs because of acrimonious humors, and heat in the fleshy parts of the temples, or an old, vehement soda, and similar things to those; and he is treated with methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have experienced in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described. 
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of procedure in their extraction is that the weak person shaves the hairs which are in the temples, and stretches towards the apparent artery in the temple.  
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it itself shows itself to you from its pulse, and rarely is it concealed except in a few men, or extreme cold.  
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is concealed from you, then let the weak person bind their head with any cloth; then rub the place with a rough cloth. 
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the place with hot water until it appears to you with manifest appearance.  
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the speculum, which I had previously prepared. 
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape away the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.  
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then project a hook into it and draw it upwards until you draw it out from the skin, and make it come out from all the tunics which are under it. 
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is slender, then envelop it with the extremity of a hook. 
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then make an incision into it according to the amount by which its extremities will be extended and contracted so that a flow of blood does not occur. 
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not incised and not cut off, the blood does not rise completely. 
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from six ounces of blood up to three. 
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the artery is large, it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a doubled, strong silk thread or with silkworm gut so that decay does not hasten to it before the wound consolidates and a flow of blood occurs. 
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then make an incision into the excess which is between the two ligatures.  
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in that hour or after another hour. 
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone with a knife cautery until its extremities fall away and it remains in place of the same operation. 
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or an overheated complexion.  
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because a cautery is one of those things that help to finish humidities. 
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.  
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the place be filled with old cotton and poultices be placed on top, loosely made. 
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after it is dissolved, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow and with dressings until it heals.  
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if meanwhile while you are operating a flow of blood occurs from the artery, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery or to fill the place with wax and bind your hand until the bleeding is stopped.  
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	But if none of these things are present to you, then place your finger on top of the place until the blood clots. 
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	Embrocate the place with water of sharp cold until the sharpness is stilled, and bind it as needed. 
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because that which is lighter and easier to extract is the vein, it is so that you should cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives; and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to a razor. 
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are of much less sharpness than two knives. 
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like two knives, cold will quickly occur to both; and they will not strike the flesh with speed. 
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore since there is a little thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is cut quickly; with this therefore it is better, lighter, and easier work.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space which is between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with a cautery; and lay both ignited strongly until they reach the mouth, and fall upon the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends may be lengthened. 
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not entirely consolidated with this cautery.  
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery. 
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of a sharp, persistent flow of tears from the eyes.  
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four. 
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from the veins which are above the outer skull; and no medicinal treatment confers anything with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already reddening, and he feels a movement on his forehead like that of ants walking; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that his eyelashes have already been corroded: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the ancients used to employ this operation in their treatment, and they called it treatment with the sword.  
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is so that you order the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead. 
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the forehead equidistant according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of an incision be like two fingers, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second a little behind the length of the motion of the masticatory muscles, and the third on the other side. 
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a speculum with two pointed ends, which soon follows this form. 
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the side of the temple up to the second incision; and with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, together with the sifac, which is above the mouth. 
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also do that from the middle incision up to the second incision.  
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this speculum and introduce into the first incision again another instrument which is called a sharp curette, blunt on one side, not sharp on the other side.  
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side against the flesh joined with skin, and its blunt side towards the mouth; and press it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut off with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until it appears from the skin. 
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.  
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity flows out from the blood, press out the places from lumps of clotted blood. 
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in all the fissures a lint made from old linen and put over them compresses soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. 
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.   
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligature and administer a plentiful infusion with warm water. 
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with royal ointment and other remedies that heal wounds until it is healed. 
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of acute tearings and discharges to the eyes from within the head.  
Caput V.	Chapter Five. 
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone has acute, sharp, and persistent discharges, and you see their eyes are weakened, small, and their gaze has already become feeble; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp, piercing pain deep in the head, and consequent sneezing: then take from these occurrences that those humors and discharges do not come except from many veins. 
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better cure for them is this.  
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you order the sick person to shave their forehead. 
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one fissure in the middle of the forehead, or a little to one side, by its width, and begin with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be up to the mouth; and extend your hand away from the temporal muscles which move at mastication: until when the mouth is exposed; and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.  
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. 
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind over it with lint; and saturate the lint with wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not occur. 
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen that, and you see that the hot abscess has already subsided; then it is necessary that you freeze the mouth until flesh begins to grow in it.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a drying regimen that causes the flesh to grow; such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony; and prepare an adhesive plaster from them, and apply it to the birth of flesh in these wounds. 
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of what falls into the Ear.  
Caput VI.	Chapter VI. 
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is of one of four kinds: either a mineral stone or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a flowing substance, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal. 
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone or something like a stone falls into the ear that neither adheres nor grows in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: then if you see the stone, distill something from oil of violets or sesame into the ear. 
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform its extraction, and make him sneeze with something sugared, and press his nostrils at the time of the sneeze, after you have placed around the ear wicks from cloth or wool, and extended the ear upwards. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Very often it comes out with this care. 
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not come out, then perform its extraction with forceps, that is, thin Pizigaroli: whose form is this.  
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If, therefore, it comes out with forceps, it is good. 
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform its extraction with a thin blind hook of few twists. 
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If, therefore, it does not come out through that, then make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal much, and pack what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil so that there is no way for air except through the tube: then extract it with your own breath with strong suction. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Very often it comes out by what we have described.  
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not come out this way: then take a small amount from hellebore or viscus, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught: and place it on the end of a probe after you have wrapped a well-positioned cotton over it: then insert it into the ear canal with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture. 
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	Therefore if it does not exit with all that we have described, then hurry to incise it before a hot abscess or spasm occurs. 
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is that phlebotomists make it first on the cephalic vein and extract from it blood according to his strength. 
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the infirm person sit between your hands and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place; and let the incision be moon-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you from the instruments.  
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the incision quickly with care, and attend to it until it heals. 
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	But if the thing falling into the ear is a single grain that grows and swells, then administer its extraction. 
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not yield to your efforts, then take a thin, delicate spatula of this shape.  
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting off of that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put many splinters on it; then extract them with hooks or with a delicate probe or with suction as we have said, for its extraction is alleviated. 
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But with regard to water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the infirm person to use sneezing when it is first instilled; and he has already filled his ear with a little old cooked oil; and he lies upon the ear in which there is water. 
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it exits through that route, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones according to the length of a finger, thin and smooth, and heat them slightly with fire; and let the infirm person insert one of them into the opening of his ear; and jump on one foot from that side, and strike it with another stone on top of the stone which is in the ear. 
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore it shall not cease to do this with stone and stone, until all the water has come out. 
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out so that you may take one from a crucible, or from a reed, and insert one end into the ear; and set fire to the other end until most of it is burned. 
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat with another reed and do this many times until all the water has come out; and extract it with a tube as was previously described in the stone. 
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	But in the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of a small body, such as a flea and the like, take care of it as I said in the division. 
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses; then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks; and its matter is easier than all that are held in the ear. 
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in the extraction of a generated worm in the ear, when you care for it with that which we said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not succeed; then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun. 
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore anything from worms appears there, then extract it with gestures or with delicate hooks.  
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a tube, whose form is narrow below, wide above; and insert the slender end into the ear according to the quantity that the weak one bears it: then suck with it with strong suction.  
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms come out. 
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to go out, then smear the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said in the stone. 
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with what we said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the infection of worms; and you will find that in the treatise on distillations. 
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	Let your effusion with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. 
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Make it yourself of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there be a small hole, wide above.  
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it therefore be such that driving what is in the cavity of the cannula is made of bronze cleanly. 
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a ray and wrap cotton about its end with decent winding; then pour oil or juice or whatever you wish from these medicines into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the ray with the cotton on top and press it with your hand with temperate compression until the oil is driven into the cavity of the hearing and the sick person feels it within; and let what is poured into the ear already be warmed a little with fire; and beware that nothing which distills into it is very cold, for medicines do not endure it. 
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the treatment of accidental hair loss of the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII. 
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants depart from the wombs of their mothers not perforated. 
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to certain men hair loss in the ear canal from a wound or flesh born therein.  
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this hair loss sometimes happens deep within the cavity of the ear which does not follow sight; and sometimes it happens near the outer opening a little and follows sight. 
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That therefore which occurs deep within the ear and which does not grasp sight is in many dispositions difficult healing.  
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows sight, it is necessary that you place the ear of the sick person in the sun and look into it; then if you see an apparent hair loss, open it with a delicate speculum, whose form is as follows: let its extremity in which there be a certain small width have a certain pointed part; and let the remaining speculum be of two smooth sides so that it does not injure the ear. 
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the growth is fleshy and arises within the ear canal: then seize it with a fine hook, and cut into it with vigorous ease until all the flesh is removed. 
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	But if the growth is deep within the ear: then take a fine, smooth probe and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal. 
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the growth with it, as the one afflicted finds with hearing impairment, try to open it with ease: and beware not to wound the nerves of the ear. 
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a lint according to the size of the opening which you enclosed in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing. 
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take lint and steep it in rose water, and sprinkle upon it ground tragacanth, and use it. 
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	But if you see that the ear is already abscessed: then it is necessary to remove the lint and let it remain with another lint which you wrap in cerate made with rose oil until the hot abscess subsides; then care for it until it heals. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if bleeding should occur: then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and place them over the ear; and use the remaining treatment which stops the aforementioned bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations.  
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the care of Althea eyelids. 
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althelias which occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry. 
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel.  
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place ground tragacanth on the spots. 
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.  
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision. 
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For it often happens that they return when something remains from their roots. 
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return. 
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of Hailstones on the eyelids of the eye.  
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens that something occurs in the eyelids which resembles a Hailstone in its firmness and hardness, and on account of this it is called a Hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick humidity in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid. 
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation on them therefore is, that you consider then if it is a Hailstone arising in it, which appears from the eyelid and moves to every part, and its matter is easy. 
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Make therefore a fissure upon it across its width. 
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then pare it away from every part with ease until it comes out.  
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off. 
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then it harms the weak one in some way.  
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the fissure is large: then join it with suture and care for it until it heals. 
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.  
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and makes it flesh.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the Hailstone is inclined towards the inner parts of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the Hailstone with a hook: besides which you will need an incision and press it from every part. 
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, it harms no one.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the Hailstone with salt water and care for the place with that which makes flesh until it heals the weak one. 
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of Axirnaths of the eyelids.  
Caput X.	Chapter Ten. 
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat which is generated in the tunics of the upper eyelid; and it most often happens to boys; and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they are not able to look at the light of the sun, therefore because tears hasten to them, and for that reason you see them lying down on their faces always, and sleeping upon them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which have already been covered by swelling; and indeed the prominence of Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them. 
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the sick person should put his head in your lap. 
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare on it lint, and make from that lint a circle according to the quantity which contains the Axirnath from every side. 
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it on top of it and press with your fingers from every side so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. 
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a scalpel making incisions across its width, and let there not be an incision larger than that which is made in bloodletting deep. 
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut the entire skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many dispositions it proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a white tallow candle.  
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth which you infiltrated between your fingers to the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add to the incision so that you do not reach with the scalpel to the eye, and injure it. 
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you add a little to the incision with ease until the Axirnath proceeds.  
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we have said. 
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with bandages. 
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are those among men who grind salt, and place it in the cavity of the fissure, so that it liquefies what remains from that moisture. 
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if an abscess occurs in a warm place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals. 
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the ways of softening the eyelid of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, from which it becomes swollen as it should not. 
Caput XI.	Chapter XI. 
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs are born on the eyelids of the eye in addition to the course under the natural hairs, and they grow long: then they harm the eye, and cause illnesses to occur, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and leukoma, until it becomes a cause for the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed Ataxmir of the eye is cured according to four methods. 
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.  
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery. 
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.  
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through reeds, according to what I will say. 
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your lap.  
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand. 
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it is turned back, it is good.  
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, in which there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with the thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, in which the hairs are born: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with a rod. 
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with the speculum entering from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal. 
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pledget from linen, or cloth; then mark upon the eyelid with resin, so that it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; because now it is diversified in men. 
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them there are some who need a large quantity to be cut from the eyelid, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.  
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the speculum find upon the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, such as is the thickness of a radius. 
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.  
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then flay the whole thing itself.  
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then unite the two lips with a suture, with a sharp needle and fine woolen thread; and cleanse away the blood, and make what runs over from the threads adhere to the two eyebrows, with certain imperceptible things, if you wish to do it; and if not, do not trouble yourself.  
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads until three or four days; afterwards attend to it. 
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture and attend to it with something that dries and constricts it.  
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its union; but it will be better in the future. 
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of healing was taught by the ancients from Ataxmir. 
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However there is solicitude over the sick person in it and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it. 
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you make a sign upon the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described. 
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three hooks separate or joined together, according to this following form, then cut off what is superfluous with small forceps, according to this form, with equal incision. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold a hook, and it does not align: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger lacrimal, and a second thread near the smaller lacrimal: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.  
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin above which the cotum is signed, as we have described. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with suture; and care for it until it heals.  
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess should occur at your incision or fissure: dry it up with cerate and such like, from soothing ointments. 
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelid also, that its hairs turn.  
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary for you to use what we have said in the incision; but the suture of both is more artful.  
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the care of Ataxmir with dogs. 
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and split the fissure which is inside, according to what I have described. 
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then with art make two reeds or two slender pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spatula; and you have already cut into the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads. 
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather each with subtlety above that which overflows from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the two reeds from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. 
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For indeed the tightened skin will die and blacken and putrefy until it falls off by itself. 
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	Therefore if it is delayed, then cut it with forceps. 
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it firms up, the eyelid is elevated: and the hairs do not sting. 
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure and quantity in length and width. 
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Concerning the elevation of stinging hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on it is that you take a fine needle and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you gather its ends and tie each with a fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm. 
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then you place another fine thread underneath it briefly in a linen cloth and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place their head in your lap and be near the sun so that the operation is illuminated: because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull out the natural hair from above. 
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up to above the thread and introduce it into the thread; if there is one, or two, or three, no more. 
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with the thread in the eyelid with the natural hair. 
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the thread is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, pull the thread down, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the thread comes out from the upper hole, and look at it with the eye; then pull the thread and the thread and take both out and close the eye, and leave it closed for two days or three until the hair adheres to its place and flesh grows over it.  
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs and it is raised with it, or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then raise it. 
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of an alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII. 
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.  
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this alxatrati is either natural or accidental. 
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental therefore comes from the consolidation of a wound, or an incision, or a cautery, and things similar to these.   
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment for it is that you cut open that consolidation and separate its lips, and place in it a licorice from flax, and bind it until it heals. 
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you use things in its treatment which dry and constrict; for if you do that, the alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather use things in it which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water in which marshmallow has been cooked, flaxseed: and an ointment of dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil; and wrap it with licorice and care for it.  
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your healing is to try with all your ingenuity that it does not become consolidated according to the form which it had at first. 
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have said is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati so that the shape of the place does not return according to what it was at all. 
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of the Alxatrati which is done in the lower eyelid and it is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left. 
Caput XIIII.	Chapter Fourteen. 
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below is the one that is truly called Alxatrati. 
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural and accidental. 
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental kind arises from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and things similar to these.  
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operation on it is to take a needle with a double thread and dye it in flesh and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.  
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad spatula. 
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.  
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a ray and place it in the fissure and turn it with the eyelid; and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision until they come together and an angle is made from them: until when they are joined the shape of them becomes this shape, which is the Greek letter lambda. 
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount which is the sharp side below it from that which follows the eyelid.  
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts; or sew them together with wool thread. 
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we have said, about softening medicines and cleansing ones until they are healed.  
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a laceration should occur from a fissure, and by suture or cautery: then it is necessary that you split the fissure flat under the eyelashes, even according to what preceded. 
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a ligature, according to what we have said. 
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the matter concerning the treatment of a laceration, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed therein according to what is prepared from the form of the laceration. 
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is of many different forms; and a prudent craftsman prepares his skill in whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the shape to its natural form or near it, and himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in very many arrangements.  
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva or cornea. 
Caput XV.	Chapter Fifteen.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations.  
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the extremity of a radius under the eyelid and raise it upward: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a fine spatulim which is not sharp in its incision but rather blunt; so that the infirm person will not be agitated at the operation, and the spatulim be removed and injure the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were scraping away that adhesion with ease until when the eyelid returns to its natural form and the whole adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, with blue water washing it: or distill into it from a sieve made, from ziniar dissolved in water.  
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a ligature of flax: and place wool infused with egg white on top of the eye: and after the third day use a sieve and apply solid dressings until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the cutting of the nail and the prominence of flesh of the tear duct. 
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen. 
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two manners. 
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nervous; and it is similar to a hard, subtle reed. 
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white humidity; which when it touches iron, or you try to take it with a hook, it is cut, and the hook does not hold fast in it.  
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin, except from the greater tear duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers the sight, and prohibits light and the movement of the eye. 
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of operation in its cutting is: that the patient should place his head in your lap.  
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand. 
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a hook of few duplications, and extend it upward.  
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, an ox, or a cow; and let the thread be strong, and double the extremity of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread, and extend it upward; and skin with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you press it with the hair up to its last part.  
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine scalpel, or with small forceps; and let the natural flesh of the tear duct be released, so that a continuous flow of tears does not occur from its incision. 
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with thread, as we have said.  
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is skinned with a gentle scalpel, of which this is the form. 
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated. 
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw into the eye something crushed salt, or a powder made from alum, and leave it until another day. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is necessary until it heals. 
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a point into it, nor does a hook take hold in it, then this kind of nail is often cured with medicines and heals as I described in the division. 
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the weak person and take a subtle spatula, gentle, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave off the nail from above with subtlety. 
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	But if you see that it becomes thinner and breaks, and the razor presses into it, then distill from your own hour into the eye a powder made from alum, or red ochre, or crushed salt: and bandage the eye until another day. 
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it until the whole of it is removed.  
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye, then let it be and take care of the abscess until it heals. 
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with a razor until it heals.  
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	But if the prominence of the tear duct flesh harms the eye greatly, suspend it with a hook and cut out a part of it: and do not finish the incision so that the course of the tears does not occur. 
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then distill into the tear duct red ochre or powder made from alum until it heals.  
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of the Alguardenic and flesh born in the eye.  
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.  
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes red flesh grows in the eyes of some men, superimposed or placed on top until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or constricts upon the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rose balustrade.  
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also such that the sick person should place their head in your lap. 
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open their eyes and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or hand. 
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel.  
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful from the eye so that you do not injure it during the operation; and let your incision be with which you cut it, or with a spathe, as we have described in the incision of a nail; or with small forceps with which asebel is collected, according to the shape that will come after this chapter.  
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is completed and all of the albuginea is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder and those similar to it from corrosive medicines; and place on the eye outside cotton wool with white lead: so that it is secured from a hot abscess.  
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	But if anything remains from the albuginea, and hot blood prevails over you, and you fear a hot abscess; then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms an abscess. 
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat upon it with the operation until it is healed.  
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do similarly with added flesh which occurs in the eye from this kind. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However it is necessary that others treat the care of all weak eyes from a natural or accidental way by operating with iron; and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member tolerates that operation. 
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the Gathering of Pterygium from the Eye.  
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18. 
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pterygium is reddish veins which are woven over the eye and prevent vision from its operation; and weaken the eye with the length of days. 
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is therefore necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is pterygium is strong and if there is no illness in it except for the pterygium; then gather its pterygium. 
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, that you order the sick person to put his head on your lap. 
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those good things with one hook, or two according to your prudence; and let the hook be subtle, of a doubling, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded in one body, according to this form. 
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then gather with subtle forceps those veins with subtlety, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins remove from the eye, and they are resolved; and beware lest you injure the eye with the extremities of the speculum. 
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation very much: so that you do not fall except upon those veins. 
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye green vitriol, or red; so that with its sharpness it corrodes what remains from the rheum. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to gather all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days, until its pain subsides: and guard against a warm poultice; then repeat upon it according to the same manner, until it is healed.  
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps. 
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of arrisati to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter Nineteen.  
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call arrisati a fistula, which you cure with a cautery, or with sharp burning medicine, according to what preceded its account. 
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it except that you cleave upon the abscess at its nativity and extract all the moisture which is in it and the pus until the mouth is exposed. 
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the mouth is exposed, and you see in it corruption, or blackness, then extirpate it with an instrument, whose form is this. 
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Asperi of the head. 
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which shall be punctured with the puncture of a file, or the puncture of a fine aliskilfer; and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. 
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand upon it a little while, until you know that corruption is already planed; and do that several times. 
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying astringent medications.  
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	And if the place is consolidated and flesh arises in it, and the course of blood is cut off; and it remains for forty days and does not renew and does not fester and no incident occurs in it: then know that it has already been healed. 
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, there is no remedy in it except to reduce the fistula to the nostril, according to this form. 
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is to uncover the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone has been uncovered, then take an auger according to this form, let its iron end be triangular: and let its wood be a pyramid thinned down to the extremity, as you see.  
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that upon the bone itself; and let it be near the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little from the eye. 
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the auger until it penetrates the bone, and feels it weak; through this it finds wind coming out of it, when it holds its hand over its nose. 
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medications as I taught you.  
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When flesh arises and the place hardens, then the matter which was flowing outwards returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter upon the weak one. 
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the Reduction of an Eye Prominence
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.  
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with all its entirety, and there is neither injury nor diminution in vision; then it is necessary that you loosen what is weak; afterwards phlebotomize him; afterward place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction. 
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Afterwards place upon the eye a liniment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla. 
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Afterwards bind the eye above with a plaster with many poultices. 
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of the poultices is: that you take many soft cloths, and double every cloth from them over four; make many from them; then place them one upon another, according to the amount which the eye needs; then bind above them with a hard cloth with strong binding. 
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat cupping glasses with suction without scarification. 
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping glasses, and let the eye be bound day and night. 
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage again becomes soft, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we have said. 
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye already having returned to its tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and poultices, and binding, and cupping glasses until it is healed.  
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the tunic. 
Caput XXI.	Chapter Twenty-One.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the eye, and then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and the form of man is spoiled because of that, and vision enters into it: then the operation on it is as follows, according to what I narrate; and it is, that you insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower to the upper part. 
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle in which there is double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate; and let the first needle go according to its disposition.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place with a double-edged knife and tie it to the part you want to take out with thread around the point of a needle: and tighten it very much. 
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then take out the needle and place on the eye wool steeped in the white of an egg: and leave it until the thread falls with the part you want to take out. 
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed. 
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the part is compressed from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye gains great prominence. 
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce it with a fine lancet, which reaches the depth of the eye, and let the white moisture run out, and let the eye descend and enter immediately: then tighten it until it is healed. 
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of Alcomnatia. 
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.  
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnatia is nothing but a humor that gathers in the eye, like descending water and it is not itself. 
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way to operate on it is to have the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the humor reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then fix it so that it does not descend and illuminate the light: and let the sick person see things as they saw them: and if it does not descend below, you know that it is water. 
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the humor is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. 
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine lancet and pierce above the corneal membrane a little at the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic, until the humor comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore when it comes out, then distill into the eye warm water in which you mixed honey: or water in which you already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed. 
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the treatment of water descending into the eye, or cataract. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII. 
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken of the kinds of water in division, and what is suitable for perforating by speech declaring and expounding, then take that same according to health. 
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the weak person sit between your hands square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his sound eye, and constrict him strongly; then pull down the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water, is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right. 
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take an almond with your right hand, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right. 
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the extremity of the almond near the cornea for the thickness of a ray in the very whiteness of the eye apparent to the lachrymal minor; then press the almond with force; and you revolve with it your hand, until it penetrates into the albuginea of the eye; and feel that the almond has now reached the empty thing. 
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of blackness; and this is the cornea of the eye.  
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the very pupil by vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the tunic of the cornea. 
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almond up to the place in which there is water. 
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down below with juice one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the weak person sees that above which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye. 
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then lay it aside second, beyond which the almond goes forth. 
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	Therefore when it is fixed and does not rise: then extract the almond with ease: and you turn your hand gradually. 
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear salt of gems in water: and bathe the eye inside with it.  
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place an entire cotton plug, or wool soaked in rose oil, and egg white over the eye: and bind it with the healthy eye. 
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We however, and those who are of our time, place ground cinnamon with egg white over it. 
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the almond does not obey you to enter the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take an instrument, which is called Alberid, which has this shape. 
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore perforate only the conjunctiva with it, and do not insert your hand into the hole: and it is only so that you make a way for the almond to a subtle place. 
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond, as we have said. 
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare a decently made bedroom for the weak one, in which he sleeps on his back in a darkened house: and prohibit him from all movements, and coughing: and place his food that which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.  
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day. 
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that darkened house and you will want to test his sight: and make him see things.  
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day. 
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he do this at the hour of healing, or immediately after the incision: rather it must be done by others: because water rises quickly through a strong gaze.  
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with that which soothes the abscess until it is soothed: then restore his sight, and place an oral remedy upon his face by which his vision is regulated under it for several days, himself existing in that darkened house. 
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out of the house gradually, and walk about in his own rooms. 
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in surgery a student is not excused from watching many times; then let him dare to operate. 
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Alacrech, who said that there was made in Alacrech a well perforated, by which water is drawn up. 
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new. 
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from a well, so that he who does not know them may stand upon it.  
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of bronze properly; and let the extremities of them be triangular with the same subtlety, and the extremity pointed. 
Formae magda.	Forms of a well. 
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of flesh born on the nose.  
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes there are born in the nose various added fleshes, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet; and from it is cancerous flesh, stony, of a dark color; and from it is that which is soft flesh, not of a dark color. 
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in that which is of these fleshes soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make him sit weak between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and project a hook into those fleshes: then draw them outwards, and cut what you have grasped from them with a fine sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has already been removed. 
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	But if there should remain something of it whose incision is not possible: then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments easily, until nothing remains of it.  
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood should overpower you, or a hot abscess should occur: then oppose to it what is necessary: or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hurry in cauterizing it until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar and water, or wine, should be poured into the nose after the incision. 
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it as far as the palate, then you know that it is already healed. 
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is flesh grown within it upon the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision. 
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread which has a certain thickness and many knots in it, placing a finger's breadth or less between each knot; and  you must guide the feeble-minded man so he inserts one end of the thread into his nose with a reed, or whatever else is possible for him after he has made it like an awl; and he draws out his own scent until it reaches the palate, and exits over his throat. 
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed they often do this very thing to young boys in schools; and it is an easy matter for him who wishes to do so. 
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which exits above the nose and the other which remains in the nose. 
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then apply a flesh-hook with the knots on the thread. 
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already caught with the knots of the thread.  
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread; and after washing away the blood, place licorice which you have steeped in Egyptian ointment into the nose. Do this for three days or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh. 
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals. 
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs drier care, use that. 
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head-plunger with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or bronze; let it be like a small lamp, open like a scallop shell, and its passageway similar. 
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a reed. 
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a head bandage should be full, open; to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish from juices and flowing things in it. 
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument. 
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the care of a broken nose. 
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV. 
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Very often a swelling arises at the end of the nose, and it magnifies and increases with the days until its appearance is foul. 
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary that you cut into it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it. 
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place either a cautery or a burning medicine on the spot which takes its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	But if the incision is delayed until it magnifies, then consider, if it is stony, hard, dark colored, and has little feeling: then do not touch it with iron; for it is a cancerous swelling. 
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen those who cut into such a swelling, and great harm befell him who had it. 
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the swelling is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that incision is possible throughout all of it, then evacuate the weak part and cut into it without fear, without dread; and care for the spot with something that dries and constricts until it is healed. 
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. 
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.  
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit results from an operation except in some individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when it happens to someone that they have one of these injuries, you must consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood; then join the two lips of the wound with suture; then care for it until it is healed. 
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of the solution has already been separated at its lips and each part has become healthy, then it is necessary to flay all the parts from their own apparent skin until it bleeds. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and ground frankincense upon it; and place upon the powders a piece of diaphanicon plaster and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two days or three.  
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then unbind it and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads fall away by themselves. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.  
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suture is to join the continuity of the solution either with needles as we have described in suturing the abdomen or to join the solution with thread as I have taught you.  
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the Extraction of Nodes from the Lips
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed have hard boils resembling grains of herb, often in the inner parts of their lips; and some of these are smaller, and others larger. 
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to turn the lip and cut upon each node of it, and to hang it with a hook, and to cut into it from every side. 
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after cutting with ground terebinth until the blood is stopped.  
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then wash it with vinegar and care for the place with it, because of its astringency, until the wounds are healed. 
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the Incision of Flesh Born Upon the Gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Very often flesh grows upon the gum, which the ancients call abuluss
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary that you hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut into it at its root, and let the serum or blood flow. 
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the spot ground saw dust, or other astringent drying powders. 
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	But if that flesh returns after healing, for it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cautery.  
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the reason of Teeth with Iron. 
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX. 
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes crusts rough and unsightly gather on the surfaces of teeth, both inner and outer, and sometimes they become blackened and turn yellow, and green, until corruption from them reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it. 
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is therefore necessary for you to make the weak person sit between your hands, and place his head in your lap, and scrape the tooth with a millstone, in which crusts appear to you like sand; until nothing remains of them, and do likewise with blackness, greenness, yellowness and others until they are clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	Therefore if what is in them from the beginning of the reason is removed it is good; and if not then repeat the reasoning on them another day, a second and third until finally you achieve your aim in that which you desire.  
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth needs razors of various shapes and many figures according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore the razor with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the razor with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.  
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of razors should be prepared by you, as you see them. 
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the Extraction of Toothache. 
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX. 
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary for you to cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and delay in its extraction.  
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing to replace it when it is extracted; because it is a noble substance: until there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the weak person is compelled to extract it, that you strengthen and assure yourself of the aching tooth. 
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Very often pain deceives the sick person and he thinks it is in a strong tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not go away until the weak tooth is extracted. 
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of those who cut veins. 
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore when a tooth that is aching itself is shown to you, it is necessary that you make incisions around the tooth with a scalpel, in which there is some strength, until the gum is loosened from every part: then move it yourself with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first gradually, until you shake it. 
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in it with a good hold, and the head of the weak tooth between your knees: which you have now held well so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to straightness so as not to break it. 
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try its motion as you did at first. 
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth and tie it with the end of a thin ray, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction upon it with forceps. 
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act with much care in the incision around the gum from every side.  
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and returns upon the weak one from that evil which is greater than its first pain. 
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness concerning its eradication beyond what we have related. 
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For very often they cause great infirmities to happen upon men, which are more difficult to break and the roots of it all remain or some of them, or that they extract it with some bones of the jawbone, as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then after its removal it should be washed with wine, or with vinegar and salt. 
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If it should happen that there is a flow of blood from the places (for this often happens) then apply something from zedoary and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if you do not have zedoary. 
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shape of the forceps which moves a tooth shall first be of long shanks, short handles, thick, so that they do not bend when pressed upon the tooth: let them be as you see with thick handles so that when you squeeze them they do not give way nor double: of short shanks and made of good iron or of well-made steel, straight shanks; and at their ends shall be teeth, some which enter others and constrict with a proper force. 
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the ends are made like the beak of a bird which is called a stork and they are of strong constriction. 
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured bones of the jaw.  
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-One. 
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains something broken at the removal of a tooth then it is necessary to put a poultice with butter upon the place for one or two days until the place is softened; then introduce an elevator, or forceps into it, whose ends are assimilated to the beak of a bird which is called a stork.  
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the shape of these forceps. 
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file inside: or like a small sickle.  
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not yield to you with these forceps then you must carefully cut the flesh over the root and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose shape is this: 
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it have a short shank, slightly thick, and let it not be wet so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out through this, it is good; and if not, you must help with these other instruments whose shapes are these. 
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness. 
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the subtle triangular extremity. 
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also joined with this instrument having two branches, which has this form. 
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth. 
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It should also be joined with this instrument which is assimilated to a large hook, of this form, a twisted triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness so that it does not break, and let it not be imbibed.  
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that dental instruments are many, and likewise the remaining instruments are not counted, and a prudent artisan, subtle in his art, finds an instrument for himself according to what the operation and illnesses themselves signify to him. 
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because from illnesses there are those to which the ancients did not say an instrument, on account of the diversity of their species. 
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jawbone breaks from the mandible or from other bones of the mouth, or it rots: then carefully examine it in its place with what suits it from instruments and forceps which I said in the extraction of roots, and join it with a gesture, which has this form.  
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let it have a certain gradual thickness so that it is strung or held with the bone and does not flee and wander until the bone comes out; and restore the place with appropriate medicines for that. 
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction and care for it until it heals. 
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the Locking of Teeth Prominent Above Others.  
Caput XXXII.	Chapter Thirty-Two. 
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, it becomes ugly by that: and especially when it happens in women, and girls, namely, those of marriageable age. 
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to consider. 
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If a tooth arises after another and is not positioned, or it is possible to file it down, but the tooth cannot be filed: then eradicate it. And if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it out with this instrument, which has this shape. 
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small beak and is made of hard iron, with a very sharp point. 
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	Let your incision be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that another is not moved from the teeth. 
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed for filing: then file it with a file of hard iron, which has this shape. 
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle of very small points, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth should be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, and finally eradicate it with certain razors.  
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	But if there is a tooth from which a part breaks off and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also until the roughness of that fracture is removed and it is made even; and smoothed so that it does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.  
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the Retention of Teeth with Gold Wires. 
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three. 
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer a concussion and jolting from a blow or fall, and the infirm person cannot bite down on it so that it does not come loose; and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but the treatment has not been effective: then there is a plan to bind them with a gold wire, because silver turns green and rots after a few days, but gold never changes. 
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be medium in subtlety and thickness according to the amount that fits between the teeth. 
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of retention indeed is, that you take a wire and insert a double length of it between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the wire among the loose teeth, whether there is one or more, until you reach with the wire to a healthy tooth on the other side. 
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture up to the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is completely removed; and let your constriction where you are stringing the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose. 
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with forceps; and join both, and turn them over with your hand; and conceal them between a healthy tooth and a moved tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain thus tightened. 
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if they become loosened, or broken, tighten them with another thread, and it will stand thus for the whole time.  
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of Teeth, and the figure of the retention of two sound teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see. 
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth, or two return after falling out and into their places, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and this is not done except by a craftsman, prudent, and experienced. 
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes one of the vaccine bones is adapted; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in its place, from which the tooth is fortified and tightened, as we said; and it remains, and is used with it for a long time.  
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the cutting of a ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prohibits speech. 
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four. 
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated. 
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the infirm one in his head in your lap, and raise his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament across its width, until the tongue is loosened from its restraint. 
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	But if there is something hard and knotty in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound; then project a hook into it, and pierce it across its width, until you strike the ligament, and the knot is loosened. 
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And take care that there is not a fissure into the depth of the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and bleeding should occur. 
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it should be washed in the trace of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.  
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a ligature from linen, which the weak person should hold in every night so that it does not become consolidated on the second day. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if bleeding should occur, then place over the spot boiled zedoary. 
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a lenticular cautery, which is suitable for that; then care for it with the remaining care until it heals. 
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the Extraction of a Ranula Which Occurs Under the Tongue.  
Caput XXXV.	Chapter Thirty-Five. 
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes it happens that under the tongue there occurs a swelling which is similar to a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural operation; and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.  
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on it is that you open the weak person's mouth before the sun, and consider the swelling. 
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the weak person does not find sensation; then do not touch it, because it is cancer. 
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture; then project into it a hook, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every part. 
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	And if blood overcomes you in the hour of your operation, then place over it boiled zedoary until the blood is cut off; then return to your operation until you extract it with all its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash it with vinegar and salt; and care for it with the remaining suitable care for that until it heals. 
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the Care of a Swelling of Two Tonsils.  
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six. 
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat glands, which resemble almonds, that protrude outward; and they are called two tonsils: when you treat these as we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider. 
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	Therefore if it is a hard abscess, dark in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron. 
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is reddish in color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather let it alone until it matures. 
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will break open on its own. 
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is slender: then it is necessary to cut into it.  
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you consider before your operation whether its hot abscess has quieted with rest completely, or diminishes somewhat: then therefore make the sick person sit before the sun, and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let a servant receive between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, which has this shape.  
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze, that is thin like a knife. 
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outward as much as you can, besides that you pull out with it some of the tunics. 
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut into it with an instrument which has this following shape.  
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles forceps: but nevertheless let its points be curved, so that the opening of each one is in a straight line with the other acutely; therefore take care that it be made of tempered iron, or aluminum imbued.  
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut into it with a scalpel, which has this shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. 
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one amygdala, cut the other according to this same kind of incision. 
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.  
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there should happen to him a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves and those like them from astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped; then care for him until he is healed. 
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two amygdales.  
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore cut them according to what I said in the incision of the two amygdales equally. 
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already treated a woman for an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was dragging it to suffocation, with few senses, because it had almost closed the throat; and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and had already forbidden her both food and drink of water; and she had already come to death if she had remained one day or two days. 
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches until they had gone out above the two nostrils.  
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore I hurried quickly and fixed a hook into one of them. 
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and a large portion was drawn from it.  
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it where I grasped it from the nostril. 
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that same thing to her from the other nostril.  
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; and afterward I fixed a hook into the abscess itself; then I cut off a part of it, and there did not flow from it except for a little blood. Therefore the woman's throat was completely opened, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times over a long period; and the abscess would succeed in the place where I was cutting, until it was prolonged excessively and came out with her. 
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I ingeniously cauterized the abscess between the throat. 
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	So it remained from addition; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with it after me. 
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of an abscess of the uvula.  
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter Thirty-Seven. 
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrh descends to the uvula and becomes abscessed and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a uva.  
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not avail; and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is subtle: then it is necessary that you incise it. 
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered round from it, and there is no length to it, and it is bloody, or dusky colored, or black, and there is no sensation to it: then it is necessary that you avoid the incision of it. 
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in this there is fear over the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore it is necessary when you see it according to the manner which I said from its whiteness and length, that you make the weak one sit before the sun; and press their tongue with an instrument of which narration preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula and draw it downward: and incise it with one of two instruments which I said in the incision of two tonsils.  
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you not incise from it except what is added beyond the natural limit without addition. 
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you incise from it more, you injure the voice and speech.  
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we narrated in the incision of two tonsils; and care for it until it heals.  
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the weak one is terrified from the incision, then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in its cauterization without fear and dread.  
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the manner of cautery in this is not except with sharp water; and it is, that you place the head of the weak one in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we have mentioned. 
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterization and mix it with a calx that has not been extinguished and make it neither thick nor thin and fill the cavity of this instrument, which has this shape. 
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity in which the medicine is placed have a cavity like the cavity of a ray's ear. 
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on his tongue; and let the sick person lie on his side so that saliva runs from his mouth from within the medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms him.  
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine. 
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first place it on his tongue for half an hour, until you see it already blackened and the bite of the medicine subdued. 
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take cotton and wrap it around the extremity of the ray and infuse the cotton with the medicine and insert the ray with the cotton into the cannula from above until the cotton adheres to the tongue.  
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the vein. 
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go; for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days. 
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	And if it is necessary for you to iterate the medicine, iterate it; and after cauterization cleanse around the vein with cotton steeped in butter, and purify what is around it from the medicine; and wash with cold water. 
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles until it is healed.  
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is a healthier kind of treatment than incision and further from fear. 
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the tongue is also cured with something more subtle than cautery and incision; for it is cured with fumigation according to this method. 
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and herbs like these; and put them all together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil; and the pot should be smeared with clay neatly; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which an instrument concave is to be placed according to this manner. 
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze; and insert the extremity, in which there is a pomegranate seed, into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the uvula above the cannula, until the uvula is darkened much. 
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries up.  
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you do this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of an abscess. 
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it most often adds to the abscess; and it is not necessary for you to do that except at the decline of its heat.  
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a cannula, and compose bark of the fig tree in its extremity; so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; for the bark of the fig tree prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with safety. 
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the Extraction of Thorns, and Bones from the Throat. 
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.  
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat. 
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore it is necessary for you to extract what of them appears above which the sight falls upon, after you press the tongue with an instrument toward the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat. 
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is concealed in the throat, it is necessary for you to make the sick person vomit before food is digested in the stomach. 
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will go out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Either the weak person swallows a piece of turnip or a lettuce root or he swallows a mouthful of dry bread; or he takes a piece of dried sea sponge which is soft and ties it on a thread, then swallows it. 
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	And when therefore it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and is drawn out, then it comes out.  
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form. 
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius a little and let there be a curve at its extremity which it introduces into his throat with ease; and let he himself have his head elevated upward. 
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis so that he does not have a coughing fit and he pushes with it the mouth or the spine or the doctor introduces it himself with his hand. 
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the weak person introduces is better because of his knowledge of the place of the thing attached and he pushes it down or pulls his hand up with the instrument all the way according to the quantity prepared for him until it comes out.  
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the Extraction of a Leech. 
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX. 
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is applied with what I said in the division on treatment with medicines and it does not detach itself then consider in the throat of the weak person in front of the sun or by the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I related to you.  
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech extract it with a small hook or with delicate forceps carefully.  
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	And if it is not possible to do so with them then take a concave tube and introduce it into the throat of the weak person up to near the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the tube iron heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times and let the weak person abstain from all water for the whole day. 
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he should take a cup full of cold water and open his mouth in it; and gargle with it, but not swallow anything from it; and stir the water with his hand one hour after another. 
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water. 
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the weak one with bugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I have described in the fumigation of the uvula. 
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, for it will fall by itself. 
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is that you should take a jar, in which there are live plums with fire; and let the jar be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is a hole; and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole. 
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then direct the fumigation, and let the weak one place his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. 
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech immediately falls. 
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.  
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak one endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and not drink water. 
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he comes out with this regimen. 
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls on top of the vision.  
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat. 
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is roughness like a file; when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all.  
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general. 
Caput XL.	Chapter 40. 
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to how we remember them, namely one, and one in this book; and they are different in their perforation and incision in two ways. 
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the type of abscess itself, and because it consists of humors. 
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is because of the places where they occur in the body. 
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to its operation.  
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of abscesses, there are some which ought not to be perforated except after the ripening of blood in them and its completion; and of these, there are some which ought to be perforated while they are raw and do not ripen according to their completion. 
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses which are near the joints. 
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs near a joint and is prolonged to be its own, until it putrifies what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is the cause of closer contraction of that limb. 
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or there is an abscess at a principal limb; for if you delay its perforation until it ripens, it will harm either that or the principal limb through it.  
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it while immature; and you ought not to perforate a raw abscess, not of complete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply and extend to the interior parts of the anus and become a fistula, or becomes incurable at its end. 
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You ought to know the hour of perforating an abscess which has ripened according to its completion; and it is at sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and throbbing, and sharpness of the head of the abscess; and the other signs. 
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of the more prominent eminence; and let the perforation be directed in length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection. 
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member. 
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when an abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you leave its perforation alone until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement. 
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps the lips of it will become hardened, and its depth. 
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body as needed: or according to that which the member requires. 
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses: or many incisions through similarity of the size of the abscess. 
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses from which it is necessary that the skin be concave: and it is cut when already made like cloth, and made at the end, which already is dead: such as happens in many, like a hernia, and buboes. 
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from those are those which are cut with an incision having three angles.  
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from those is one from which it is cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf. 
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from those are those in which a round incision and a crescent incision are administered: and similar to those from incisions. 
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But that which does not have a head, such as soft, superficial abscesses, it is necessary that you pierce it with a superficial perforation, or only a flat one.  
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and draw out all the pus at that time; rather, draw out a part of it. 
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then stitch up the abscess until another day. 
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then again draw out some pus. 
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak of body, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the exit of pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive. 
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore be very careful in this chapter.  
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you pierce it by which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary that you wash the wound and consider.  
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	And if therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply a bandage from linen, or old cotton. 
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures from the perforation, it is necessary then that you insert into every fissure a bandage until they reach one another. 
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the abscess, or hollowed it around: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or shaved with linen fluff without moisture; and tighten it until the third day. 
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it off, and care for it with what is necessary from ointment until it heals.  
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if bleeding should occur during the hour of your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth is soaked in them; and place it upon the place of bleeding many times. 
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer treatment and care, and powders, which I have related in many places of this book of ours, and by division. 
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is wintertime and the place of the abscess is full of nerves, then you must pour warm broth with wine and oil upon it and place them over the area. 
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is summertime and the areas are fleshy, then you must place compresses soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, upon them entirely cold. 
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you must open the abscess and cleanse it, and administer to its cure what is suitable for it until it is healed. 
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This, therefore, is all that is necessary from the knowledge of treating abscesses universally. 
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess and how its cure is approached chapter by chapter individually. 
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of abscesses which occur on the skin of the head.  
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41. 
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the kinds of nodules, which contain sheaths that are like sacks to them, as if they were poultices of hens. 
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of them. 
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty; some contain moisture like slime; some contain moisture like curds and pulps, and those similar; and some are hard and stony.  
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all of them and their extraction there is no fear, as long as an artery does not oppose during their incision. 
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in incising them is to test them with an instrument whose shape comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains. 
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is one that contains moisture, then dry it with a longitudinal incision, shallow in depth, according to this form. 
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When, therefore, the moisture is evacuated, then remove the skin that contains it and do not leave anything behind in it. 
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if something remains from it. 
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the dressing in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.  
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remains from the cyst. 
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the dressing on it with a second Egyptian ointment, and a third, and if it does not digest with that, until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst, then heal the wound with ointment until it is cured. 
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the abscess contains a fatty node, then dry it according to this manner, with an incision in the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two lips of the incision, and flay it from every part; and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it. 
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you after.  
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise in a stony abscess, from an incision and the same treatment, according to what we have said.  
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision over a stony abscess is easier; because it has little blood and moisture. 
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are on the head in some people with which there is no moisture at all.  
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	For it is this: because I cut on an abscess on the head of a young woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with something throwing, he would wound himself.  
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other abscesses which happen on the head, except these abscesses which happen on children's heads, and at the roots of the ears, let the incision of all of them be a superficial one. 
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or always make a perforation of them from their lower part so that the course of blood is relieved downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it with what suits them from treatment. 
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the Section of Strangulation in the Neck. 
Caput XLII.	Chapter Forty-Two. 
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These swellings often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body. 
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And regarding those which occur in the neck from them, they are one, and many; and they are generated from each other; and every swelling from them is within its own tunic, just as it is in knots and swellings of the head, as we have narrated. 
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these swellings are many. 
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And of them indeed are stony ones; and of them are those which contain moisture; and of them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment. 
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that which you see of them of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the color of the skin is manifest, and moves in every direction, and is not joined with the nerves of the neck, nor with the gullet, nor with the artery, and is not deep: it is necessary that you section it superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line, b. to line, g.; and flay it from every side; and extend two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks if needed by it, as we have said in swellings of the head, and extract it gradually. 
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is for caution that a vein or nerve not be cut. 
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be very sharp so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary. 
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or artery, or it prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound chewed oak, or certain powders which stanch blood, and constrict the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the swelling subsides, and the wound softens: or until it begins and wants to putrefy. 
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is severed by a tunic, therefore return to your operation until you finish it. 
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger if anything remains from the small ligatures; therefore cut them and clean them. 
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein in the root of the ligature then it is necessary that you do not cut that ligature from its root; rather it is necessary that you tie it with a strong doubled thread, and let it fall off by itself without harm. 
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old fat which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment. 
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it yourself. 
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole ligature is cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound and sew it up immediately after you see that there is absolutely no excess remaining. 
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the ligature then it is necessary for you to intend to cut its root and remove it; and administer the suture which we have described. 
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And that which the ligature contains of moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation so that the place of its maturity appears to you and place the perforation from that which follows below the body as we have said. 
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation lint with ointment and the like so that it corrodes what remains from decay until when you see that the wound is already cleansed; then take care of it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.  
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess within the throat by accident. 
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43. 
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this incision was made on the epiglottis and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the writing of their speech. 
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have synanche, it is necessary that the epiglottis be cut; since benefit is not made through it because all the veins and lungs are weak. 
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot apostema in the mouth, or throat, or both almonds, when there is no pain in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction which arises from pre-speech. 
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do this, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across its width, in the space between two circles, so that the incision be made in flesh, not cartilage; and indeed this place is suitable for the incision because it is private of flesh, and blood vessels are distant from it.  
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	But if the practitioner is timid, then it is necessary for him to extend the skin of the throat with a hook. 
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should grasp the skin until he reaches the canal; divert the blood vessels if he sees anything from them. 
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the flesh as we have described; and it is shown above the incision of the canal from phlegm that issues forth from it, with what is broken up, and cessation of voice.  
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time. 
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour arrives in which pre-speech is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew it alone without cartilage.  
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it heals. 
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse which we have recounted is not explained except when they see that one of these apostemas has already coalesced the throat of the sick person; and he is raised up on the brink of death, and desires to interrupt his breathings: they go to cut the epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe upon the wound with a certain respiration and be saved from death; and for this reason they prescribed leaving the wound open until the malice of the sickness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and as if it were itself; then therefore they prescribed suturing the wound and taking care of it until it heals. 
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I myself have seen is that one maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and with it she struck part of the pulmonary canal. 
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was summoned to treat her, and I found her groaning, as is the groan of one dying.  
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound, and I found that little blood had come out from it. 
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore perplexed, because she had not severed a vein, nor a sinew; and wind was escaping from the wound.  
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I hastened therefore and sewed up her wound, and I cared for it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice; and after a few days she returned to a better state of health.  
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say from this: that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis. 
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the incision of a hernia of the throat. 
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter Forty-four.  
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling called a hernia of the throat is a large swelling, according to the color of the body; and it is common in women.  
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural; or it is accidental. 
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural kind, there certainly is no artifice.  
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental kind, however, occurs in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty nodules. 
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to a swelling that arises from the knotting of an artery.  
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in this case and it should not be presumed to be incised with iron unless it is small; and you must examine it and investigate it with a probe.  
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty nodule and it is not suspended with any veins; then cut it out as nodules are cut; and extract it with what it contains from the cyst if it is in a cyst; and if it is not, then carefully examine all of it.  
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what is necessary for healing, until it heals. 
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the Section of Kinds of Nodes. 
Caput XLV.	Chapter Forty-Five.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division; and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a node and an excrescence: since there is a doubt-causing one. 
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when there is an excrescence, there is heat and fever and violent pains until the boiling of the superfluity subsides and putrefaction is completed; then indeed the fevers and heat subside. 
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But with a node there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in sacs sifachin, which is their own sac, and it is according to the color of the body: and the beginning of them is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a date stone, larger and smaller.  
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty; or containing moisture. 
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of the moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.  
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore it is necessary that when you arrive at the treatment of a node, you should examine it and inquire into it first with an instrument called an intromissor, according to what its form will come to be in the chapter which is after this.  
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry for abscesses and all nodes is to take this instrument and insert it into the damper place which you find in the abscess; and turn your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. 
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then finally measure your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.  
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then draw out the intromissor and consider that which comes forth in its trace. 
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore moisture flows out, whatever the color may be; then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses. 
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if the moisture does not flow out in the track of the Intromissi, then know that it is fat; therefore cut upon it a section in the shape of a cross, according to this form as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease; and keep a kistin if you can over it, so as to draw out the entire one healthy with a knot. 
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kistin is broken at the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then draw it out in pieces until nothing remains of it. 
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much of it remains, the Knot returns most often.  
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And if it overcomes you and a little remains from it: then fill the wound upon your completion with certain corrosive sharp powders; and constrict the wound and put upon it something that sits hot poultice, and care for it with the rest of the cure until it heals. 
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	But if the Knot is large, then cut its two lips, and care for it as it incorporates.  
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if a vein contrary to you pulsates or does not pulsate, then hurry and fill the place with triturated zegi, and leave it constricted for two days or three until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood subsides; then return to cutting what remains from the Knot. 
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning external instruments for incision and perforation.  
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI. 
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of these are the forms of Intromissis and they are of three species.  
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one. 
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of sharp square-ended iron so they quickly enter the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experimenters, or rather, perforators, and one of them is called a beris, that is, a perforator, and they are of three species. 
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one. 
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	It is agreed that they should be investigated through them abscesses, and fistulas, and buboes from that which is between them of bones.  
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles with which cushions are sewn, namely from citron, or from bronze, or iron, or silver. 
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those that are made from citron. 
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also made from black lead, which are suitable for experimenting with fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they are reflected with their smoothness with those reflections. 
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds. 
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the amount of the width of the fistula and its tightness.  
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Form of Hooks, and they are of many kinds. 
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them are simple ones, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.  
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds. 
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place. 
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Knives, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.  
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their tips with which the cutting is done are sharp, other tips are not sharp: and they are not put thus unless so that with them there is relief in the scraping of nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the weak are healed through them and find a little tranquility from the burning they experience at the scraping of an abscess. 
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magda, and they are of three kinds. 
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and they are similar to a razor, with which alcohol is made: and at the wide end there is a hidden spatulated point: and through it runs inwards, and outwards when you wish, as you see. 
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The spatulated forms which are concealed between the fingers at the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small. 
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Forms for drawing out wind with which the flow of blood is severed: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small. 
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of bronze, or brass, round, to a length a little as you see: and let them be fine. 
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of wind-drawing instruments be large and small with you: so that you may sever blood quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you. 
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them in the cutting of blood in every place in the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the calves of the leg, and the hip, and the calves of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar places to these, from the fleshy calves, moist.  
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made into other small instruments similar to hazelnut shells, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at an incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape. 
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of the breasts of men which resemble the breasts of women.  
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the nipples of certain men swell up during sleep (that is, when they begin to be excited in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain fetid abscesses.  
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever shuns that, must cut above the nipples with a lunar section, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove all the fat and skin. 
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with flesh-colored medicine. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with suture and care for it until it heals. 
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the nipple descends downwards and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it must be divided on its two upper sides with two similar lunar incisions, each of which is joined with the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing the smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove the skin that is between the two lips and take away the fat and administer what we said about suture and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals. 
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you cannot complete the incision as it ought to be made, because of the restlessness of the patient or because of bleeding: then it is necessary to fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On puncturing an abscess which occurs under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the nipple are of a kind of hard Strophulus, which contains cysts and some that contain humors. 
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore those which are of the kind that contain humors must be cut with a lunar incision according to this form from line b to line g. And when all that is in the abscess is evacuated as pus, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day. 
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the cotton and treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals.  
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the kind of knots called Strophulas, then split it open above it, as we said in the section on Strophulas equally. 
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends so as to discharge pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said previously. 
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and vein. 
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, an abscess often results; similarly, a vein may also develop an abscess and swelling. 
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	The signs by which it is recognized that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or vein are these: when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating sensation. 
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round and evident on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	To make an incision on this abscess is an error, especially when it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very large. 
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it is necessary that its treatment be performed with fire, and what arises from them also at the extremities or in the head must be separated.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On that which arises from the swelling of an artery opening, make an incision in the skin along its length. 
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, and then expose the artery; free it from its surrounding tissues until it is exposed.  
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with two threads in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the area between the two ligatures with a scalpel until all the blood in it has exited and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall away; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed. 
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to a vein being cut, then you must hold with your hand as much as possible from the abscess together with the skin. 
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be in it a double thread until you draw it out from the other side. 
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess together with a good ligature, as I told you in regard to a ligature for a vein, from two parts with two ends of thread. 
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the needle incision; press and tighten your threads in four places. 
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle until what is in it comes out; then incise the excess skin and let what is tied be released from it.  
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place upon it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil. 
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply a treatment made with lint and ointments until it is healed. 
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning an abscess which occurs from twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter One.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess occurs in nerves; which happens to them by a blow or from excessive labor and the like; and it most often occurs in places of support, such as the heel, and in every place where joints are moved; and it is a serious abscess. 
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many positions without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, a weak person feels a sensation similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a collected abscess deep within the body; rather, it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and it does not extend forward or back. 
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is among them at the joints should not be invaded with iron. 
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction may occur. 
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is among them on the head, or on the forehead, find the skin with a spatula. 
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore there is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root. 
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and bring the wound together with suture: and care for it until it heals. 
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess, which occurs in the abdomen.  
Caput LI.	Chapter LI. 
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to some men many times in their abdomens, and in the other bodies of theirs, boils, which are called fungal, by similarity of them with fungi. 
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is delicate, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.  
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small: and some of them grow very large. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I indeed already saw a man, and in his abdomen were two boils, which were more similar to fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, small-rooted, and their lips were inverted, and they split open, and moisture always flowed from them. 
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut into them, and found in the weight of one almost ten and eight ounces and in the other almost six ounces. And the operation in cutting them is that you consider then, if he is weak, moist, and the color of the boil is white, moist, delicate-rooted: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have a cautery in your presence in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Very often much blood is expelled at its incision: hasten therefore if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.  
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see a weak and timid one from the incision with iron, then take a thread of lead well made, and constrict it with it: whose method is what we said, and let it go for two days. 
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add it to the mold of lead. 
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to press the lead, whenever it prints on the thelil, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort. 
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the thelil should be of a thick root, then there is some fear and dread in its incision; especially that which is in the belly. 
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless it is possible to cut into half of it.  
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not grow back. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound is healed.  
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful not to presume to cut into the thelil which is of a dark color, little feeling, foul appearance; for it is indeed a cancerous swelling; and I shall come with a remembrance of Cancer after this. 
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of umbilical hernia. 
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.  
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	An umbilical hernia occurs from many causes. 
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures in the diaphragm which is above the belly; and from it exits fat or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures. 
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a Vein or an Artery, according to what was previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from wind constricted within it. 
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is because of a fissure in the diaphragm and the exit of fat; then its color is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft, without pain; and appears in various locations. 
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of the exit of intestine, then its location, with that which we have narrated, is of more vehement diversity. 
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore when you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and there is vehement labor. 
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is because of moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract or increase. 
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears darkening from the cleavage. 
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to flesh: then the abscess is grave, thick, hard, and is fixed according to a single quantity. 
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is due to windiness, then its touch is soft. 
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on that is, that you then consider if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to blood from an Artery or Vein, or windiness: then it is necessary that you prohibit its cure.  
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein. 
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to intestine or mesentery: then it is necessary that you advise the sick person, so that he may hold his breath and stand extended. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with a cautery all around the umbilicus.  
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards instruct him to lie down between your hands on his back. 
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula all around the umbilicus above the place which you marked with a cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook. 
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it tightly around with thread or cord from silk with a firm bandage: and let the knot of the bandage be distant. 
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the extended abscess above the bandage.  
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already caught by the bandage: then extract the distant one and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly: and if you find a mesentery, then take hold of it with a hook and cut off its excess. 
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if contrary to this it is an artery or vein: then encircle it greatly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation. 
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circle which you made around the apostema in the shape of a cross, making them penetrate. 
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then constrict the apostema in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh putrifies; and falls off by itself; or cut it yourself when it softens and putrifies. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments until it heals.  
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the prominence of the umbilicus is from raw flesh in it, or from moisture; then it is necessary to make concave apostemas, as we said. 
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And you should draw out the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what strengthens the place. 
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the treatment of CANCER. 
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53. 
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how the way to its cure is with medicines; and we cautioned against it being treated with iron so as not to ulcerate it; and we spoke of Cancer generated in the womb, and the caution against its treatment. 
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible; such as Cancer which is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and those like it, from the limbs suited to extracting all of it; especially when it is beginning and small. 
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it grows old, and is large, it is not necessary to approach it. 
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself have not been able to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen another before me who attained that.  
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation for it, when it is located as we said, is to precede and loosen the weak part from black bile several times. 
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find the phlebotomy itself with manifest fullness. 
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick person with preparation, in which he will be placed during the operation. 
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then project into the Cancer hooks that are suitable for him. 
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then scoop it out from every side with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood run, and do not cut it off quickly, rather press the places, and wipe away all thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there. 
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the thick flow of blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is severed. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.  
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the Treatment of Hydropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter Fifty-Four. 
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already narrated in the division of species of Hydropsy, and how the aggregation of water is made; and the signs of every species, and its cure with medicine.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is none other than the ascites species alone; and it does not approach the species tympanitis nor the hyposarcae species at all, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this kind of dropsy of the ear drum with medicine, and your medication has not been successful, then consider. 
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the weak patient has already acquired debility, or if there is another illness with him besides dropsy, such as if he has a cough with it, or loosening of the bowels, and similar things to these, then beware lest you treat him with iron, for there is fear of that. 
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see the patient to be exuberant in strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation on him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and a minister behind him shall press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest. 
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thorny spatulate, according to this form. 
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp points, long, with a sharp extremity like a spatula.  
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be some slight shortness in it, so that you do not pierce through to the intestine with it during the operation, and injure it. 
Deinde considera.	Then consider. 
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the dropsy is a result of the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the length of three fingers, towards the lower part in its direction above the chest. 
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the dropsy arises from a liver ailment, then let your incision be on the left, from the navel by three fingers. 
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its origin is from the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it should not also be necessary that the incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak place. 
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce through the whole skin with the instrument.  
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert it into the incision and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and flesh, as if you were flaying it; and let the amount that is flayed be the size of a nail, or thereabouts. 
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the bladder until the trocar reaches the empty place: and that place is for water. 
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then withdraw it, and introduce into the opening an instrument which has this shape. 
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a cannula; made of silver, or brass, or orichalcum, smooth and polished: to the lower part of which there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other: and the face of its extremity is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed pen, as you see: in its upper extremity there is a ring.  
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore it evacuates a moderate amount of water in an hour. 
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, the sick man perhaps dies in an hour through dissolution of his animal spirits: or he suffers a swoon which approaches death.  
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the sick man's dispositions signify to you from the power of his pulse, and from his good condition.  
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water. 
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the opening which is above the bladder: of which I have spoken, so that you pierce it according to that method. 
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the next day, if you see the sick man tolerate it; and also evacuate a small amount from the water. 
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there does not remain from the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are afraid for the sick man and dismiss a great deal from the water: then care for him with burial in warm sand, and much sweat in a bath and the sun, and expect thirst upon him; and care for him with drying medicines until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after the extraction of the water, according to what I have spoken in that which precedes. 
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the treatment of infants who are born with their urine openings not pierced. 
Caput LV.	Chapter Fifty-Five. 
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any of the infants exits from the belly of its mother and the urine opening of its head is not pierced, or the hole is narrow, or it is in a wrong place. 
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is therefore necessary to help with its piercing immediately when it is born with a fine Spatumili according to this form. 
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin lead plumb bob into the hole and tie it; and hold it for three days or four. 
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it therefore wants to emit urine, remove it and let it mingle.  
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then put it back in. 
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close. 
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose hole is narrow is treated with lead as we said for many days until it widens. 
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those in whom the hole is in a wrong place are injured. 
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	For it is so that from those who are born, the hole is at the end of the head bone; therefore it cannot urinate forward until it raises its bone with its own hand to a higher place. 
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb according to straightness; and it is a very foul disease.  
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation on him is that the sick person is laid on their back. 
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head bone with your left hand using strong extension, and cut the top of the head bone from the place near the penis with a sharp point or a fine Spatumili: as is the incision of a reed or as you shave something so that its middle becomes like the head bone; and so that the hole falls in the middle as it should be. 
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of the flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens. 
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose it with that which cuts blood, and care for the wound until it heals. 
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning swellings that occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and putrefaction, blackness, and adhesion. 
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56. 
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These swellings often occur in the penis and there is a prominence of foul flesh. 
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some are malignant from it and some are not malignant.  
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, a non-malignant one ought to be suspended with a fine hook and cut off until it is cleansed entirely.  
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment. 
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.  
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the swelling is malignant and foul-colored, then you ought to apply a cautery to it after its incision and its scraping.  
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the swelling is in the foreskin of a captive, uncircumcised man, and part of the swelling is between the foreskin and part of it is outside, then you ought to remove the swelling which is inside first, until when it consolidates, then care for that which is outside; because when you care for both together, the foreskin will not be secured lest it be pierced.  
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also happen sometimes in the testicles and foreskin, blackness and putrefaction. 
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you ought to carve away everything that has already blackened and which is about to putrefy, or which has already putrefied. 
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then smear it afterwards with honey that has been mixed with flour of pomegranate grains and crushed herbs sifted through a sieve.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if bleeding occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form. 
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For a cautery is helpful for two things at once, namely, for the flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted. 
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	And if the head of the rod is corroded, and it is all destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary that you insert into the urethra of the penis a cannula made of lead, so that the weak one may urinate upon it. 
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	But in the adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this indeed adhesion does not happen except in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound or an abscess: it is therefore necessary that you scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the ligament is loosened and the head of the penis is freed from every part. 
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	And if it is difficult to distinguish these things exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape off something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin. 
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	For this is because when the foreskin is delicate it may perhaps be perforated quickly because of its delicacy.  
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again. 
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with astringent wine until it consolidates. 
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of infants and their treatment in case of an accident. 
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds: nevertheless since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper in boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it a better operation and an easier way leading to health.  
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws and it is only what we have acquired through experience.  
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	For this is because I have found the greater part of surgeons and phlebotomists to use cleansing, circumcising with a lancet and with forceps: and they use alum, and ligature with thread and incision with a scalpel. 
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have now tested all these methods and found none better than cleansing with forceps and ligating with thread. 
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in cleansing with a scalpel, the skin often escapes. 
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the foreskin has two coats; therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower coat remains: thus it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and there will be future pain. 
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing which is done by an alfect, that is, a finger, which tailors use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured; for perhaps it enters into its opening. 
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in cleansing with a nail, the iron perhaps goes astray and ruins your operation; and indeed the skin of a child is short in nature, and very often they are born thus, so that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this. 
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But cleansing with forceps and ligation with thread has shown me a good experiment; because the forceps are proportional to the incision; therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below. 
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore when you press your hand forward, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they fall according to a single operation at one time; and there is compression of a similar shape, containing the skin of the rod from every side, with which there is no error at all. 
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of the proper operation is to make you estimate, especially a boy if he is one of those who understand a little, that you do not do anything except bind the thread on his rod only; and let him go until another day. 
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible for you, because he receives his own intelligence. 
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands in a prepared posture and let him not be sitting; and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.  
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into its groove and blow upon the skin, and draw it upwards until the head of the groover emerges. 
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from whatever filth may collect in it. 
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread. 
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, bind a little lower a second ligature. 
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with a good grip, and cut between the two ligatures. 
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly raise the skin upwards and extract the head of the groover. 
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder over it; and upon the powder a cloth in which has been spread yolk of egg previously cooked in rose water, mixed with good recent oil of roses; and let it remain upon it until another day; and treat it with further care until it heals. 
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	But the form of the forceps for cleansing is this. 
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt and converging so that the branch of the clavicle does not slip out of them; and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two handles. 
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But an error which may occur in cleansing is this: that perchance the whole inner skin or a part of it may escape at the incision. 
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your nail before applying the poultice; and cut into it according to equality. 
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut into it. 
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days pass and what is under the groover remains swollen and inflamed as an abscess, then let it be so until the abscess becomes settled and hot; and flay it easily, and cut into it according to what is prepared for you; and beware of the head of the groover. 
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him. 
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore care for it with that which consolidates a wound from powders, which we have related in the treatise on powders; and if it falls from the skin above the measurement, and reaches upward, it will not harm him even then. 
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it with what we have said until it is healed. 
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the Extraction of Retained Urine in the Bladder.  
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII. 
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh grown there, and similar things from those which we have said from the methods of treatment in the division. 
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is because of a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be weak, curved over his knees. 
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak one hold his breath as much as possible for him.  
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus the neck of the bladder is forced toward the expulsion of the stone to the back; therefore the urine is discharged. 
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it is not discharged with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the weak one; then it is necessary that you administer his extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be made of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like a bird's quill in the subtlety of its radius, long in the likeness of one and a half palms; to which let there be a slender cannula at its head. 
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the manner of the exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good ligature, and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut off with forceps anything which overflows from the wool, but insert it into the cannula forcefully, like raising. 
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or butter, and egg white; and make the weak person sit upon a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and the penis of him with oily moist substances, and olive oil, and warm water. 
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis. 
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upward from the part above the navel. 
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then press the syringe within it until it reaches the bladder, and let the weak person feel that he has already reached the empty thing; and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage in which it goes is one in which there is a winding. 
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually. 
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For urine will follow the wool. 
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw it out, and make the urine run through the way of urine; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that until the bladder is emptied, and the weak person finds relief. 
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the Quality of Bladder Irrigation with a Clepshydra.  
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX. 
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus constricts in it, and one wishes to distill waters and medicines into it; then let it be done with an instrument which is called a Clepshydra, and this is its form. 
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is deaf, that is, closed. 
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see. 
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which presses, let it be according to the quantity which it will fill itself without addition, until when it is drawn with it something, from moisture it is drawn: and when it is pressed, with it it is expelled to a distance; according to what the clepshydra does, with which naphtha is projected, that is, Greek fire in battles of war. 
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when you wish to inject moisture into the bladder, insert the extremity of the syringe into the moisture and draw with it that which pushes upwards, for moisture is drawn into the concavity of the syringe. 
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert the extremity of it into the rod, according as we have described concerning the syringe. 
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then force the moisture with that which forces it; for the moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the weak one feels it. 
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form of a slender clyster by means of which the bladder is injected.  
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or brass; of which the head is higher and similar to a small mortar, and beneath it a groove into which a ligature may fall. 
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ram, and put into it the moisture with which you wish to inject the bladder.  
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between the two grooves with a strong ligature using a double thread; and warm that moisture slightly over fire. 
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the clyster into the rod; afterwards constrict your hand above the bladder with moisture with a decent constriction, until the weak one feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder. 
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it through all its roundness. 
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as a bandage is gathered; after you have put into it that which you wish from moisture, and oils, and waters. 
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it into the instrument; and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder. 
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Concerning the Extraction of a Stone.  
Caput LX.	Chapter Sixty. 
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already said in the division, the kinds of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have said the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of all of it; and I said the stone in which operation falls with the hand and sectioning; and there is a stone generated properly in the bladder; and that which is attached to the rod; and I am narrating that with manifest exposition and abbreviation. 
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children. 
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine coming forth from the bladder resembles water in its subtlety; and there appears in it white sand, and a weak man rubs his staff with it, and labors with it, and very often hangs. 
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected, and the anus goes out with it in many of them. 
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure of children is easy from that time until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men. 
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths however it is medium, in that which is between those two; and the cure of him whose stone is larger is easier; and if it is small, the care for it is greater.  
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is necessary first of all that we purify the sick man with an enema which extracts all the dung which is in his bowels; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone in the examination. 
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick man be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards so that the stone descends to the depths of the bladder, or jumps from a high place several times. 
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his hips so that the whole bladder becomes sloping downwards. 
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally. 
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in a space, then hasten immediately with an incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall at all under your touch, then you must wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the sick man is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full-grown youth; and insert it into his anus, and inquire for the stone until it stands under your finger: and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger and drive it outward toward the place whose incision you desire; and order your assistant to press the bladder with his hand; and order another assistant to extend the testicles upward with his right hand, and with his other hand remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is to be made. 
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the speculum, which has this form. 
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, but to the side near the left buttock; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the outer part of the incision is wide and the inner part is narrow, according to the quantity by which the egress of the stone from it will not be greater.  
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision and it exits without difficulty. 
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that a stone with angles and edges is difficult to extract because of them. 
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And there is one which is smooth, similar to a gland, and round; and its exit is easy.  
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, for one which has angles and edges, add an incision into the fissure. 
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not exit this way, then you must ingeniously work on it; or tie a ligature over it with a crescent-shaped end, which will constrict the stone and not slip from it; or insert a fine instrument under it with a curved end. 
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot work on it above, then enlarge the opening a little.  
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something overcomes you from blood, cut it off with a scalpel. 
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if there is more than one stone, then first drive the largest one towards the bladder opening. 
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then make an incision over it. 
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then drive a small one after that; and do the same if there are more than two.  
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, ignorance is to make a large incision above it. 
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or there occurs to him a continuous distillation of urine: therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all. 
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it goes out: or ingeniously break it with forceps until you pull it out piecemeal. 
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	Therefore when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place upon it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that a hot swelling is seated. 
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the weak one supine on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.  
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you loosen it, embrocate the place with water and much oil. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with dyafinicon ointment, and basilicum ointment until it is healed.  
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if a further hot swelling, and corrosion, and things similar to those occur in the wound: such as if the blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it: and that is recognized from the issuing of blood with the urine.  
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood. 
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it brings about corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.  
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it every kind of thing suitable for its healing until it is healed.  
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the whole time of treatment that you bind two thighs and hipbones together, because of the medicines which are placed upon the place.  
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if a stone is small, and is in the urethra of the penis, and is fixed in it and prohibits the passage of urine: then care for it with that which I have related before you come to incision.  
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For very often you are excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it. 
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And take a perforator of iron, with a triangular point, sharp, fixed in wood. 
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and bind it to a stick under a stone so that it does not return to the bladder. 
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating iron into the stick easily until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and revolve the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually; and try to make a perforation in it until you make it penetrate from the other side.  
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is immediately discharged. 
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the stick.  
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it is broken and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed. 
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it: then bind a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone. 
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the stick itself between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.  
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the bandage and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound. 
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind the thread under the stone unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other thread above unless so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place and heals the wound; and because of this it is necessary for you when binding the upper thread to lift the skin upwards so that it comes back to its completion and heals the wound, as we have said.  
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extraction of Stones from Women. 
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXl.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones rarely form in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it should happen to one of them a stone, then the cure is difficult and is forbidden because of many ways.  
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that a woman might possibly be a virgin. 
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or from those having husbands. 
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman who well knows this art, especially the operation with the hand. 
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: wherefore it needs deep incision, and there is fear in that. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	But if necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary that you take a woman doctor, well knowing: and few are found. 
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you deprive yourself of those things then seek a chaste doctor, subtle and present a female midwife well taught in the matter of women, or a woman who inclines to this art, a part of the art; therefore make her present, and especially to her, that she do all that you command her from inquiry upon the stone.  
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all which is, that she look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.  
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, she will constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the weak woman, and inquire about the stone, after she has placed her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. 
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone then it is necessary that gradually she move it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with all her strength until it arrives with it at the root of the thigh. 
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then cut upon it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever part she prepares for it and feels the stone in that part: and her finger is not removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first. 
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should introduce a probe over that incision. 
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore he feels a stone, then let him add to the incision according to the proportional amount by which the stone exits from it. 
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many kinds of stones. 
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these there is a small one and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches. 
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its kind so that it may be made clear to you by this regarding what you see. 
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add pounded lint in its place and hold it for one hour until the blood is stemmed. 
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and do that you prepare for yourself from the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of a stone in men so that you may be helped through them in your operation.  
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if blood flow overcomes you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut then put powder over the place and bind it with powders in a decent bandage and do not change it; and leave the stone and do not extract it.  
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman may die. 
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then attend to the wound. 
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days and the place festers, then return to your operation until the stone comes out. 
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On Incising for Aqueous Hernia. 
Caput LXII.	Chapter Sixty-Two.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	An aqueous hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white sac which is under the skin containing the testicle; and it is called a sac. 
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own groin which nature prepared for it in that part until it swells; which is another egg and it is the skin of the testicle between the white sac which we mentioned; and this does not happen except rarely. 
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed the generation of these branches is from a weakness that occurs in the testicles; therefore this matter is poured forth to them. 
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles. 
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity has many colors. 
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For its color is either inclined toward yellowness, or it is blood-red, or fecal, black, or it is watery white, and that which is more. 
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the aggregation of water is are these. 
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac which we have said, then the abscess is round in length a little like the shape of an "o," and the testicle does not appear because the humidity contains it from every side. 
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the humidity is in its own scrotum, then the abscess is round with a part of an "o," and because of this a man thinks that it is another egg. 
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.  
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the humidity, then experience the color of the humidity in the abscess with a square instrument, whose shape precedes. 
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which comes out in the trace of the instrument, judge concerning that which is between it.  
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, it is necessary that you advise the sick person that he should be bled if it is possible for him; and you see his body full.  
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he is laid on his back on a high thing a little, and many cloths are put under him. 
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you sit on his left side and direct the attendant to sit on his right side who should extend his instrument towards one of two sides of the skin of the testicles and towards the part marveling at the belly. 
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad scalpel and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle through its length, up to near the comb; and let the incision be made according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles until it reaches the white sifac comprehending it; and flay it out and observe, or beware from this, that you cut it; and let your flaying be from the part which hangs with the egg more; and carefully scrutinize with the flaying according to the quantity that is possible for you. 
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation and extract all the water. 
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks and extend the bladder upward, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles; and incise the bladder however it is possible for you to incise it, either with its entirety or in pieces, especially its thinner side. 
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not diligently examine it, there will be no safety in its incision, lest the water return.  
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the external testicle proceeds from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the bladder, replace it. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with suture.  
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like the other wounds until it heals. 
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find a corrupted testicle from blackness or other signs, then it is necessary to tie the vessels which are suspensive, fearing the flow of blood. 
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspensory ligament and extract the testicle; afterwards care for it as we have said. 
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if the water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part according to what you did in the other equally.  
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems fitting to you that the operation be one, then do so; then wipe away the blood. 
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool steeped in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside other wool than that which you have steeped in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the belly; and put double cloths on top, they are bandages; and tie them on top with a bandage having six strands according to this form. 
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and have them taken and filled with a cooked poultice according to this similarity: and let their ends be pressed from the elbow or wet wool; and they are gathered together with a bandage on the upper arms: and one of the ends takes hold above the anus up to the back, and the second takes hold at the side of the breastbone: and two ends on top of the two thighs below and the other two ends on top of the two groins, and let the entire bandage be gathered on the upper arms. 
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this membrane is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of incision with iron; and it is as you should take a sharp knife-cautery and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and ignite it according to what we have said: until when a white sifac appears containing water, then take a cautery of this shape. 
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Greek letters are assimilated. 
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that cautery and ignite it until all the moisture comes out.  
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the sifac with hooks and flay it with a thin ignited cautery and cut into it as much as you are able until you root out all of it. 
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle.  
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer and further from hemorrhage and better than the operation with incision. 
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if it presents opposition to you in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cautery an inflamed abscess, or hemorrhage, or anything else: then it is necessary that you treat what opposition it presents to you from it with the treatment which suits it according to what has been said previously.  
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is weak and fearful, and does not await this operation because of its horror: then administer a perforation according to what I relate it: and it is. 
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are assured at your place by that which we said about the signs, that the membrane is watery: then it is necessary that you make the weak person sit upon a raised seat.  
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in the lower part of it with a broad trocar; and place the piercing according to the length of the body; and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out. 
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a compress on the spot and bind it, and let it be so that the remainder of the water runs out; then treat it until the wound is healed.  
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is an opposition to the water escaping at the hour you pierce it; and this is not except because the white fatty layer makes opposition at the wound's opening and prevents the water from going out: then it is necessary that you introduce a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which water of dropsy patients is extracted, whose shape precedes; or add a little in the operation of the wound. 
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and collects again after six months, or thereabouts. 
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	Therefore when it collects, then it is returned to according to the same way, and the sick man will pass his days. 
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the care of fleshy branches. 
Caput LXIII.	Chapter Sixty-Three. 
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section on this branch, there is fear leading to destruction in many dispositions. 
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its dismissal is saving from it.  
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation on it, and the kind of abscess. 
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in bodies, from which the testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from acute or sharp superabundance, which is poured onto the testicles. 
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.  
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body and pain is not found in it: and it is a heavy abscess. 
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark brown, and there is no sensation to it.  
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the knotting of arteries and their inflation, as I have already mentioned its remembrance; or from the inflation of veins. 
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which therefore is from them from the inflation of arteries, it is recognized by the disposition of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary for you to touch it altogether. 
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is done by the inflation of veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with the fingers. 
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section be made on this species, and on the other flesh; and it is to cut the skin of the testicles.  
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the testicle upward and extract it with white silk; and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and incise the spermatic cord after you have freed it from every part of the parts of the testicle.  
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the testicle is consolidated with those flesh born together, then it is necessary that you draw out the testicle and incise it. 
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something of the spermatic cord or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a round incision. 
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it and extract the testicle as we have said.  
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete then fill the wound with lint steeped in rose oil and wine; then care for it with the remaining care until it heals.  
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Concerning the Care of Branches, which are with Vines. 
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIIII
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Hydrocele is a swelling enveloped with a certain involution, like a dropsy, with the softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult walking and exercise.  
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment there is fear because of that of which mention was made before. 
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary for us to say that an operation be done on it according to what the ancients did.  
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I therefore say that it is necessary that you make the patient sit upon a raised seat. 
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then press the spermatic cord of the testicles downward. 
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the veins that are near the penis; and let another attendant hold them, and extend them with a vigorous extension. 
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a wide, sharp scalpel in a transverse section in the direction of the veins, until the veins are exposed. 
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then skin from every part, as we told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.  
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then place a needle with a double thread into them, and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur; and tie it again at the last of them.  
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in a straight middle section along the length of the body, and extract what collects from humid, corrupted excretions. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the care of the other wounds, in which you wish to generate pus, so that the veins which nourish one of the testicles may fall away.  
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad through that. 
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it should happen to a vein with all the veins, then it is necessary that they be extracted because of this testicles with the veins: so that the testicle is not deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.  
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the care of Intestinal Branches. 
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV. 
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this Intestinal Branch is from a section, which occurs in an extended colon over the belly in the groin part from the belly button.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.  
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the colon, or its extension. 
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two species occur from many causes: either from percussion, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the colon
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It happens gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly; and it is an abscess equal towards the depth because the suture compresses the intestine. 
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign is when it is from the section of a suture, because it causes to happen from its beginning intense pain suddenly; and it is a separate abscess appearing under the nearby skin; and that is because of the exit of the intestine and its course to the outside of the suture.  
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it issues forth with intestine a swelling; and this is called an intestinal Ramex and a swelling; and sometimes it happens with flatulence. 
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces runs into the intestine and is retained there; and it is with this deadly to the sick person because it causes severe pain to happen, and especially when it is pressed. 
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the species of this sickness with iron there is fear; therefore it is necessary that one should beware in this matter.  
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the manner of the operation is that you direct the sick person to return the intestine with his hand to the interior of its cavity if it obeys the return. 
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he is laid back on his neck between your hands; and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin upward and cut all the skin of the testicles through its length. 
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision according to as you judge to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the quantity as much as possible so that an egg may exit from it. 
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the sutures and what are under the skin of the testicles until when the white suture, hard on all sides is uncovered; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle into that which is between the white suture, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second suture, and loosen with it the adhesion which is in the back part of the egg.  
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicles and with this extend the white linen upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with the linen to the part to be cut, and order the assistant to extend the testicle upwards, and you will loosen the adhesion which is behind after complete detachment. 
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers so that nothing from the intestine remains entangled in the hard white linen. 
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something from it, then push it down towards the lower abdomen. 
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread made of licorice from ten threads and insert it at the last linen, that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles following the incision, then cut off the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads. 
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over some in the shape of a cross and tie them with the linen bandage we spoke of, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until nothing from the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them so that hot abscess does not occur there. 
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two fingers.  
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures let out from the linen which is under the skin of the testicles a quantity the size of a finger and cut off the rest according to its roundness, and remove the testicle from it.  
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cauterize the lower part of the skin of the testicles with the incision from which blood and pus flow, as we have narrated in what has been said before. 
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound and administer the bandage we have spoken of.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white linen that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision fearing bleeding. 
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Very often this happens. 
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligature until it falls by itself. 
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its falling is delayed, then embrocate it with warm water and place upon it that which we have said, until it falls. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the remaining care of wounds, until it is healed. 
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning a windy branch. 
Caput LXVI.	Chapter Sixty-Six. 
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this branch I have not seen anyone who dared to perform surgery upon it with iron.  
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first of all they said that it is done as we have narrated in the branch which is with a vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, that you bind the vessels after section above them with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally care for it with that which opens it up, until the vessels fall away; and care for the wound, according to what we said, until it is healed.  
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning a rupture which occurs in the groins. 
Caput LXVII.	Chapter Sixty-Seven. 
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is a small amount, and it returns in all hours: but if time prolongs with it, a fissure is added to the inguinal canal, until the intestines descend into the inguinal canal.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs from the extension of the inguinal canal which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the inguinal canal is extended; then it is softened and the place becomes inflamed and protrudes. 
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with a cautery, as its preceding narration has shown. 
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands. 
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the inflamed and protruding place of the rupture, by a section across its width, according to the amount of three fingers.  
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the ligature and what is under the skin until a white vein is revealed, which follows it beneath the skin. 
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray and place it upon the prominent spot from the vein and press it deep into the abdomen.  
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then choose two prominent spots above the end of the ray from the vein and join them together with a suture; then extract the end of the ray. 
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut into the vein at all, nor pull the egg, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal branches. 
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with wound care.  
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads clean it and restore the wound until it is consolidated. 
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the vein contracts and no prominence of a rupture is added. 
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place; because it is closer to safety. 
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.  
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the flesh between them is softened and its appearance is spoiled. 
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its treatment, to make the sick man lie on his back and cut away all the softened skin onto the natural skin. 
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then join the two lips with a suture; and if you wish, use at first three or four sutures on the excess softened skin and firm the suture. 
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat it with the care of other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out. 
¶ De Castratione.	On castration.  
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX. 
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law and because of this it would be permissible for me not to remember it in this book of mine; and there is no need to remember it except for two reasons.  
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is, that it be in the knowledge of medicine when asked about it: and that he know its cure to whom it happens. 
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another way is, that we very often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, kids, and cats, and similar animals. 
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done according to two ways. 
Aut per attritionem.	Or by abrasion. 
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure, and section. 
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	But in that which is done by abrasion, the way of the operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down: then rub them with your hand, until they are resolved and do not appear under touch. 
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.  
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then ligature the spermatic cord, and cut above all the egg with one incision, until when two eggs proceed: then incise them after you have skinned both, and do not leave anything above them except a subtle wick, which is above the vessels.  
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this way of castration is better than that which is done by abrasion: because abrasion perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse. 
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.  
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the care of hermaphrodites in two ways. 
Caput LXX.	Chapter Seventy. 
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from males according to two ways. 
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in him that follows a space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like that of a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.  
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubic bone, just like the testicles of a man, very small, prominent outwardly: one of which is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles. 
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, two from men and one species from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh until their impression escapes. 
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the care of other wounds. 
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second species of men, from which urine flows, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all. 
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of a tenting and prominent flesh in the vulva of women. 
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A tenting may perhaps be added upon the natural part until its appearance becomes unsightly and foul: and sometimes it magnifies in certain women so much that it expands like in men, and reaches even to intercourse. 
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore it is necessary that you grasp the excess tenting with your hand or a hook and make an incision; and do not stop in the incision, especially deep at the root: so that bleeding does not occur. 
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the care of other wounds until it heals.  
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh that arises is flesh that is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes outward according to the likeness of a tail; and on account of this some ancients call the ailment tailed. 
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that we cut it like we cut the tenting, and treat it until it heals. 
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the care of an alratic vulva, which is a vulva not perforated.  
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	An alratic vulva is one that is not perforated, or has a small opening. 
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental. 
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from a preceding illness and it itself is made either from flesh added that was born, or thin pus, or thick; and it is made either in the depth of the womb, or on its sides, or in its upper part, or lower part; and it prohibits coitus and impregnation and childbirth, and perhaps prohibits menstruation. 
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is made by the midwife's view, if evident swelling is nearby.  
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not evident, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod. 
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the swelling is from thin pus and is near by two lips then hurry and break it open.  
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is as if you put poultices on two lips. 
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the index fingers of both your hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.  
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength until the thin pus is broken and the swelling is opened. 
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it upon the spot; and let the woman come every day so that the place does not solidify with other fluid. 
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the pus is thick and dense then it is necessary that you cut it with a wide spatula similar to a myrtle leaf. 
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the swelling is from flesh that was born then suspend it with hooks and cut into it; and let there be medicines with you which stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia and dragon's blood and alum aggregate with egg white. 
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for several days; and administer a bandage of dry linen, then let the rest be cured until it is healed.  
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes there is born a nativity of other flesh within the womb; therefore it is necessary that they be cut according to this manner: but if there is no cancerous swelling for a cancerous swelling in the womb should not be opposed with iron at all. 
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, athehelil, and bothor rubeae in the vulvas of women. 
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter Seventy-Three. 
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood constantly flows from them. 
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids become ancient, they become athehelil; and I have already said in the division of their species and signs: and I will say here which ones receive healing from them, and which ones do not. 
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the matrix, and do not appear to the senses: then there is no healing for them with iron.  
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those from them which are in the orifice of the matrix on which sensation falls are those that are healed. 
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is therefore necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.  
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the athehelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots. 
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle upon them at the flow of blood from one of the cutting powders without modification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and those similar to them.  
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for an hour. 
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards place her in cold water. 
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	But if the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumacs, and pomegranate rinds, and galls, and those similar to them. 
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it upon her back.  
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is therefore cut off with it, it is good: and if not, make the windswept ones adhere to the back, and nipples, without scarification.  
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and submerge it in the juice of tamarind, or the juice of arugula, or the juice of twigs of alang-alang, that is, aglantus, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place. 
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when the abscess is quiet, care for the place with ointments until it heals. 
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	However, a red ulcer resembles the heads of alfa-alfa, and it has a rough appearance. 
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut out what appears from it, as I said in the chapter equally; and care for it until it heals. 
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On Perforation of the Uterus which Occurs in the Womb. 
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter Seventy-Four. 
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscesses, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot abscesses. 
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already said all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise a hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is from abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron. 
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to consider.  
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with percussion, and heat, and fever; and you see it to be red; if numbness falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation; and care for it with that which helps with its maturation, until when the sharpness of the occurrences becomes quiet.  
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit upon a seat which beats two seats, and recline, or lean upon her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of her belly; and let her hips be spread, and let her put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it. 
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit from the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.  
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in those which are behind. 
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the Speculum deep in the matrix of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and does not injure the weak parts. 
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument should be longer than deep, then it is necessary that you place lint on the covering of the deep matrix: so that entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix is prohibited: and it is necessary that you place the handle, which runs in the instrument, on the upper side: and that you hold the instrument, and that the assistant revolves the handle until the depth of the matrix is opened. 
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	Therefore when the Exterior appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and pliable: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula. 
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	Therefore when the blood is evacuated, it is necessary that you place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which there is a certain astringency: and place the linen cloth and draw out the incision into the depth of the matrix. 
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally on the matrix, and above the comb clean wool soaked in water, in which apples have been boiled.  
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment suitable for it until it is healed.  
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the matrix and the wound are washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long birthwort has been boiled; then let it return to the ointment. 
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound should be hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, but rather care for it with what we said in the division. 
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrine of Obstetrics: How living embryos are treated, according to an unnatural figure having exited.  
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXV. 
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for an obstetrician to know first the figure of natural childbirth. 
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, from its signs, it is that when you see a woman compressed toward the lower parts, and desires to smell air, and finds relief above her about childbirth, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then you know that this childbirth is according to the natural figure, and its exit is upon its head, and following with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. 
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore when you see these signs, it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends quickly.  
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon its head, the following parts descend with it, and are cleansed from those superfluities by good cleansing. 
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is besides this childbirth is unnatural, undesirable.  
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus goes forth upon its feet, and its body goes forth before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one of its feet; or its head goes forth and its hands; or its belly goes forth; and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things from undesirable figures.  
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for an obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how its ingenuity is in it, and may be signified by it, and stand upon it. 
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus goes forth upon its head by its natural exit, and it becomes vehement upon the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her; and vaporize her vulva with decocted fenugreek, and with moist oils.  
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the obstetrician introduce a small spatula between her fingers, and grasp the following part with it, and cut it with her fingernail until what is in it runs out from moisture; and press the belly of the woman until the fetus descends.  
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil. 
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her after the enema to compress it; and make her cough when compressed, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. 
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately come out. 
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary that you return them gradually with ease.  
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey upon entering, then place the woman over a seat and raise her feet upwards; then strike the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the impact. 
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with cloth and extract it evenly for it will come out. 
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo upon its feet.  
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges on its feet then it is necessary that you push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards equalize it.  
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually. 
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge as far as the hips, then order her to compress it and make her cough when compressed; for it will come out if God wills.  
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form. 
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then come out with an easy exit. 
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is hindered with all that we have described, then take fenugreek mucilage and sesame oil and dissolved gum; and strike the whole in a mortar with good percussion; then smear the woman's vulva and lower part of her belly with it. 
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then have her sit in warm water until her lower abdomen follows suit. 
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	Therefore, when you see that its lower parts are already heated, then make for it a poultice of myrrh and apply it. 
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the poultice has remained for one hour, then make it sit upon a seat.  
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make it snore and compress its mouth and nose and press the lower part of its belly with gentle pressure. 
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the pus will come out immediately. 
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The expulsion of the fetus is upon the knees and hands.  
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then he will begin gently introducing his hands. 
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman is laid on her back upon her neck and her feet hang down to the lower part, and she lies upon a bed and entwines her hands.  
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press upon her belly gradually. 
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then draw out what is under her feet from the cushions until she is prepared in the lower part.  
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	And if the fetus does not come out then take hold of her feet and move them with a vigorous motion. 
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.  
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let him introduce his hands and equalize the fetus gradually and order the woman to compress herself until the fetus comes out. 
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The expulsion of the fetus is horizontal, hanging from the hands.  
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He will begin by reducing his hand. 
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if he cannot reduce it then raise the woman and make her walk.  
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk then make her lie upon a bed and strike her legs with a vigorous concussion. 
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the poultice which you have prepared from mucilages. 
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	But if she receives childbirth then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in reducing the hand and equalize the fetus according to its natural form and make the woman snore and order her to compress herself until it comes out. 
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its neck, with hands spread out, and its face towards the back of its mother. 
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it gradually, and equalize it with ease. 
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is equalized, then place upon its vulva what we have described from oil and gums. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually. 
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and instruct her to incline towards her right side. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to compress, and make her snort when it is pressed.  
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus over its side. 
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the orifice of the matrix according to this method with the secundina, then split the secundina with your nail until it is evacuated from moisture. 
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the umbilicus so that it is not retained and dies. 
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then press the fetus towards the interior until you place it according to what is necessary, and instruct the woman to compress herself several times for it will exit by an easy passage. 
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The Exit of Twins or Many Fetuses.  
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are very often born, and sometimes three, and four are born. 
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However that is extraordinary and rarely happens.  
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five however is against nature and they do not live entirely and it contains them although they are multiplied, one secundina and they are separated by a sifach distinguishing the ligature in the umbilicus of each of them.  
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they exit just as one fetus exits by a natural, easy passage and they exit by a difficult passage, as we have described. 
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	And if some of them are difficult at childbirth and they arrive at what we said from unnatural figures then take care of them as we have described and let there be a subtle midwife, and she does what she does with ease and slowness and devises according to every figure with what is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to health.  
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember what is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted. 
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten; and it has already been verified with me that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed. 
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.  
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of Obstetrics. 
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it may happen to her like that one; therefore let her oppose him with what is necessary. 
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.  
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI. 
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus as I said in the division from medication, and it does not exit, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then it is necessary that you consider.  
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound health, and is not with any of the accidents from which her loss is feared: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back on a bed, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs elevated; and let attendants hold her from two sides, or she be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled out at the extraction of the fetus. 
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the uterus with oily substances with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. 
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her insert it into the uterus with ease. 
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should seek with it a place in which to fix hooks from the fetus, and places suitable for that.  
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix hooks into its eyes, or into its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its chin, or into its clavicle, or into places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria. 
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is upon his feet, then into the breastbone and his middle ribs. 
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he hold the hook with his right hand and put the curve of it into what is between the fingers of his left hand; and introduce it with his hand easily, and fix the hook in some one of those places which we have mentioned, until he reaches the empty part. 
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix opposite to it another hook, or a third if necessary, so that the contraction is equal and does not incline to one side. 
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let there not be extension according to straightness only, but rather moved to every part so that its outlet is relieved; just as is done with a tooth in its eradication.  
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in what is between that, that the extension be softened. 
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	And if a part is retained from it, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may revolve what is retained with them. 
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus goes out, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher; do this until the whole fetus goes out. 
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand goes out before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it. 
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then draw it out until the whole of it goes out, cut it either at the joint of the sole or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do in one hand and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the fetus is large, or constriction happens to it in the outlet, or there is water collected in its head; then it is necessary that he insert between his fingers a Spatulum spinosum, and pierce with it the head, and draw out the water; or break it up itself with an instrument which is called Almisdac; the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.  
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly he should do if the fetus is of a large head, then it is necessary that you make an incision above the shoulder: or extract it with forceps, as we said. 
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps. 
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head emerges and is constricted at the fork: then cut it, until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out. 
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not become entangled, nor yield to coming out: then cut the head into pieces, as much as is possible for you. 
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if below the abdomen there is an abscess or dropsy: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until the moisture runs out of it. 
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight. 
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted at the belly or chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wound around your hand: and cut the belly or chest until what is inside them runs out. 
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns: then let the midwife introduce her left hand.  
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then let her introduce her hand deep into the womb, and seek the head with it, and draw it up to the mouth of the womb with her fingers: then let her introduce one hook or two hooks into it and draw it out with them. 
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	But if the mouth of the womb constricts because of a hot abscess which happens to it: then it is not necessary that she labors upon it, but rather it is necessary at that time to administer a poultice of humid things, fatty things: and apply plasters; and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten. 
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it will become equal: then administer what we said for a living fetus. 
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed. 
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you must not leave anything from the second layer inside at all. 
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said for hot abscesses that occur in the matrices. 
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	But if there should be a flow of blood, then let it descend into astringent waters, and administer the remaining care. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman in whose belly a fetus had died; then she became pregnant again with another, afterwards that fetus also died.  
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled up until it opened, and it began to discharge pus. 
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore summoned to treat her, and I treated her for a long time; but the wound did not heal.  
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction; and an opening came out of the place. 
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed, and another opening appeared.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed there, since there is no opening in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetuses.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones, with the woman being in her better conditions; and she now lives thus for a long time, and she discharges a little pus from the place. 
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not affirm this as something foreign, except because there is knowledge in it, and assistance to that which the craftsman physician administers with his hand from healing. 
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the Forms of Instruments Necessary in the Extraction of a Fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter Seventy-Seven. 
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Below here is the form of a Strictor, as it is made equal in the books, to which two vortexes are equally set at the two ends of two pieces of wood. 
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	But this screw must be made thinner than a ligature and to do so it should be made of ebony or boxwood. 
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all the wood should be about two fingers and the edge of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed on both of them, whose length is half a palm and a little more or less; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more or less. 
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the mold so that it opens with them when you turn the two screws. 
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the screw by which the mold is opened. 
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, but thinner and lighter. 
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood or boxwood according to the likeness of forceps. 
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	But at the end of it there should be two additions as you see here above; and the length of each addition from them is about a palm; and the width of each is two fingers. 
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore when you wish to open the mold with it, then make the woman sit on a bed with her legs hanging down, opening what is between her thighs.  
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the mold; and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.  
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the mold's mouth until the midwife does what she wants. 
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another screw which the ancients called the Form of Impelling, by which the fetus is impelled.  
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which a large head is crushed; and it is similar to forceps, which has teeth at the end as you see. 
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is oblong, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which one cuts and crushes. 
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac with which the head of infants is crushed. 
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of Uncini having one point.  
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of Uncini having two points. 
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps which has teeth like a saw, with which the head of a fetus is crushed.  
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatula having two ends for cutting off the head. 
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatulas also wide. 
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their kinds are multiplied and they are prepared by the craftsman, the quicker they are for their operation, and higher among men, because of their quantity. 
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any instrument from them, but let it be prepared by you. 
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable. 
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the Extraction of the Afterbirth.  
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter Seventy-Eight.  
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the afterbirth is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you order the weak woman to retain her breath.  
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then have her lie down and strain as if she were constipated; and compress your hand over her mouth and her nostrils. 
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out through this, it is good.  
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a jar and make a hole in its lid; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, dill, cinnamon cassia, and centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over fire. 
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed tube over the hole of the jar's lid and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her breathe deeply, as we have said. 
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For then it will exit easily. 
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not exit: then order the midwife to immerse her hand in oil of sesame, or hollyhock mucilage. 
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her introduce it into the vulva and search for the secundina with it.  
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	And when she has found it, then let her take hold of it and gradually draw it out. 
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep within the uterus, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until she finds the secundina and gradually draw it out according to its straightness so that the uterus does not fall due to a strong pull; indeed, it is necessary for it to be moved with ease to the right and left sides; then add to the amount of traction.  
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For then it obeys and is preserved and comes loose from its adhesion. 
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the mouth of the uterus is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing and a medicine from a pot with herbs. 
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not exit with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out by repeatedly attempting the extraction. 
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Rather, it is necessary that what comes out at the mouth of the uterus be tied to the woman's thigh.  
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then give her an enema with the tetrapharmacon ointment. 
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will putrefy it after a few days and dissolve it so that it exits.  
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrifies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head and harms a weak one. 
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations must be administered for that.  
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients who are already experienced have used the fumigation of watercress and dried figs. 
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which a woman is smoked at the retention of the secundines and menses. 
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass like an alembic or of pewter; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the smoking be set upon coals; let her hold it until that smoking is consumed; and repeat another. 
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the cure of an unperforated anus. 
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX. 
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which a subtle suture has already closed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife perforate that suture with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatulim; and let her beware lest the laceration touch it. 
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool steeped in wine and oil. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with ointments until it is healed.  
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will close, then place a lead cannula in the foramen for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.  
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now it happens that closure of the anus also occurs from consolidation of a wound or an abscess. 
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, let that consolidation be cut, then let it be cured with what we said from the cure and lead.  
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the Cure of Fistulas Which Occur in the Lower Part. 
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX. 
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are nodulations and swellings which occur near the anus externally; or in the space of one part; and there is one fistula or several.  
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodulation becomes old, it opens, and a watery moisture, white, or subtle pus flows from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.  
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating ones are recognized by this, that it flows out from defecation and flatulence, when the sick person uses defecation; and perhaps a worm flows out from them.  
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are fistulas when they are penetrating into space as far as the bladder and as far as the urethra. 
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating as far as the junction of the hip, and as far as the node of the tailbone. 
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that which is known of a penetrating fistula to the anus, even from one that is not penetrating, it is, that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a slender probe into the fistula from metal or iron when there is no tortuosity.  
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a slender probe from lead or a hair from horse hairs until you feel the probe or hair on your finger. 
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything proceed from the opening by way of excretion, nor flatulence, nor worm as I said: then know that it is non-penetrating; hasten therefore to treatment. 
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating as far as the bladder or as far as the urethra: then its indication is the discharge of urine from it and the prohibition of it from this so that the place may be consolidated with medicine. 
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating as far as the junction of the hip or as far as the acetabulum, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no tortuosity in it up to the opening and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area and that pus always issues from it: and that medication is ineffective in it nor does it consolidate with ointment.  
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity for a foolish physician upon whom it is inflicted. 
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a knife according to what I tell you and I have already proven: and it is, that the sick person lies between your hands on his back and raise his legs up above his hips and let his hips be inclined towards his belly. 
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead probe, or one of air, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches. 
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if he feels it weak around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus. 
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel the probe already penetrated through itself, beyond which you feel between your finger and it, or flesh: then you know for sure that it is penetrating: do not therefore labor on it, because it is not its healing, as we said. 
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They however said, that the flesh is healed in some men, and from the medication for which he hopes for benefit, it is, to ignite a subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as precedes, and to introduce it ignited into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.  
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice, or three times until you know, that all those added filtered flesh, which are similar to a bird's quill pen, have now been burned.  
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh depart: then care for it with ointments generating flesh and consolidating. 
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.  
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it never heals with any other treatment. 
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe exits and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or sifac between it and the probe: and you see the fistula following the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will cut with the probe what is in the fistula, until the section reaches where the extremity of the probe arrives, and the probe is freed and falls. 
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh, which are assimilated to a bird's quill pen, so that nothing remains from them.  
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, blood overcomes you and dissolves between you and your operation so that you sever those flesh: then it is better, and quicker relief, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine. 
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because a cautery with fire gathers good qualities, it adds burning of those added flesh and cutting off blood and drying up moistures. 
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with linen wrapped in butter or chopped stalks until the place emits pus and those burnt flesh go out into the pus. 
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for then the wound with hardening ointments, those that produce hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are astringency and drying. 
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then they already heal: and you do not fear repetition.  
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus and is elongated from excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and inquire with it. 
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a probe and between you and it there is a membrane of fat or flesh and it is near penetration: then there is no operation on it except according to the way of trust and hope. 
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is because it is administered in it one of three ways: either that you cauterize it itself as we said or that you cut it until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert linen and care from next. 
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting so that you do not fall into the sphincter containing the anus and it happens to the weak a discharge of excretion without will. 
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for it with what we said.  
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal or you lengthen the membrane itself and cleanse it after you dry it up to near the anus as we said either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the cutting up to where you can with examination. 
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to restore the whole wound with a section and an upper opening where it is consolidated, and there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier for the sick person. 
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula follows in this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an awl of aleskef, that is, prepared leather, according to this form. 
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped from five threads, and around it. 
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity. 
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	Therefore, if it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tighten both, and let it go for one or two days; and the more the thread falls into the flesh, tighten it well, until those pieces of flesh that are between the two ends of the thread fall off; then care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed.  
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way that is prepared for you, unless it is very deep. 
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not fitting for you to do that because of a tear, lest you fall into it.  
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do as we said with it until it is healed. 
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of a spathulated spine with which the fistula is divided, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not fall into what is not necessary, as you see. 
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood runs from their incision: and the care of fissures.  
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI 
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids according to two types. 
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either within the anus, similar to bladders of coals or prunes; or as if they themselves are grains of a bean.  
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them are small ones and large ones: and blood runs from them always, and it is one, and there are many.  
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities. 
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But these which are outside the anus are according to most few in moisture, from which runs a yellow water, or little blood with a constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body. 
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you command the sick person to sit: and it should be pressed until the anus emerges, and the hemorrhoids appear to you. 
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore suspend them with hooks; or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut into them at their roots. 
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if hooks are not retained in them because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a swab made from double wool, and draw them out with your fingers. 
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut into them, and sprinkle over them after the incision certain hot powders, so that they stand in place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization. 
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.  
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not yield to protrusion, then give the sick person an enema in which there is a little mordant, so that it washes with what is in the anus, and yields to protrusion quickly when the sick person strains. 
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the hemorrhoids are external from the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is like you should take them with your fingernail or take them with a hook, and cut into them.  
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we have said until they are healed. 
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever recoils from incision with a knife, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this manner. 
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take an unraveled thread and insert it into the eye of a needle. 
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the thread upward and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on one side; and entwine the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, so that they are parallel; and tighten the thread with a strong knot. 
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread and withdraw the needle. 
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the threads, and leave one out of them; do not draw it tight so that excess blood may run from it. 
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or carrot juice on top of it and put it over the wound; and instruct the patient to rest. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave him until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the threads fall off, care for them with ointments and the remaining treatment until they are healed. 
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Concerning the Care of Fisures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often happen from the drying up of feces and constriction of nature. 
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become hardened and medicine does not work in them; then it is necessary that you scrape them with a spatula point or with your fingernail until they become moist and the upper layer which prevents them from consolidating is removed. 
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they consolidate as needed.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not consolidate; then repeat them with a more vigorous scraping than the first, until they bleed much and are flayed, then care for them until they are healed. 
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the Treatment of Hemorrhoids Inverted and Not Inverted; and Threads Dry and Ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.  
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that a hemorrhoid is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it happens throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and pain arises from them upon walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the clavicle be cut and be held with forceps, or with a hook, and be eradicated from its root. 
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter. 
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But from the dried athel one is a small eminence, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.  
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur in the hands of boys. 
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is, that you extend the athel, and cut it; or you tie it with silk thread; or with a hair until it falls off.  
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athel are eradicated, and those not inverted with the instrument that I shall say. 
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Furthermore, a formica is also a small filtered eminence, thick, above the surface of the body, going deep; and when it finds cold, it feels like a ant bite and spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs in the hands. 
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a cannula from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather; and place the cannula over the formica until the circle of the cannula contains its parts. 
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with the cannula until you cut what is in the circumference of the formica; and place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the formica from its root.  
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do that with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form. 
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn upward and covered, so that the apprehension on it is relieved and its rotation itself. 
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what was previously mentioned in the cauterization of the athel in the chapter on cauterization. 
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Of the forms of instruments which are employed for fistulas in diseases of the anus, and opening of the abdomen, and colic. 
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter Eighty-Three. 
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or hammered. 
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these instruments small and large, according to those in which they are administered.  
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore that which is administered in the healing of very young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak, or painful, so too their enemas. 
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.  
Cistere paruum.	A small enema. 
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cane of it, that is, the upper head in which the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this manner; and let there be a distinction so that the bladder is tied as you see, and the lower extremity which is introduced into the anus should be deaf, that is, not open, smooth, very drawing towards subtlety: and on one side of it let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole. 
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be from an animal's bladder: or from sheepskin parchment, which should be according to the form of a small wineskin: whose root is one palm.   
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be perforated with many holes as it is turned, and the space which is between every hole should be the thickness of a finger. 
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which should be from ten threads or thereabouts, and join it with a bladder like a wineskin.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the bladder is placed in it, tie it tightly in the head of the enema between two distinct constrictions. 
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the circle bladders here depicted and their holes. 
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of giving an enema with it is: to fill a syringe or bladder from medicine which is warmed according to the amount tolerated by the sick person; and be careful that it is not very hot or very cold. 
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person is laid on their back and raises their legs upwards; and put underneath them a mattress, that is, skin on which people lie, or a sheet. 
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then smear the end of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar things. 
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus easily.  
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant grasp the syringe with both hands together and squeeze it forcefully until they have emptied everything that is in the enema into the intestines. 
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then withdraw the enema, and let the sick person raise their legs to the wall. 
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	And if the medicine compels them to defecate, then they should hold it as long as they can.  
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if they sleep with it all night, it is better for healing. 
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you give an enema to them in illnesses of abdominal dropsy, and their defecation is hurried; then repeat the enema until they are healed. 
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	But if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very subtle and gentle, from the enemas with which children are given enemas. 
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a subtle enema for when the skin is tight.  
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture. 
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was appropriate for the book, and I will say here their treatment with the hand and with medicines according to supplementation. 
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what they are done by and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are often made are like the throwing of a stone: or a cut with a sword, or a knife; or a blow with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and similar things from many objects. 
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds which are made according to the parts of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or thigh; and similar ones from those limbs.  
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am relating the treatments of some wounds so that I may put this reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds. 
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds; because the recollection of compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.  
Dico ergo.	Therefore, I say. 
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of the bone; then consider if it is from the throw of a stone, or things similar to it, and has already broken only the skin; and the wound is large, and you fear for a bad outcome of hot abscess; then hurry and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and draw out blood from him according to the quantity of his strength: if there is nothing forbidding phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out from the wound is little. 
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part. 
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware for himself against repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.  
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something forbids reduction, then let him reduce from food, and not approach meats, nor wines. 
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if a hot abscess happens to him, cotton infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency. 
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are safe from a hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and has not been changed by air, the powder which I will relate a little later: and if it has already been changed by air, then put on it certain ointments until it heals. 
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from a cut by a sword, and similar weapons: and the lips thereof do not come together by stitches, then join it with suture, according to what I shall relate about wounds of the belly and their suturing. 
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound has already been torn from the bone, and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory, then cut it. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in it in place of the skin, and instruct the sick person to nourish themselves with foods which have substance, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until they are plump; and those similar. 
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out all the putrefaction, and throw it away; then treat that [area]. 
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines, then inquire above the artery. 
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a Spatula, or tie it off. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if necessity compels when that which we said does not apply, then cauterize it until the blood is severed. 
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small, simple, then their matter is easy, light: so that you sprinkle on them this powder: because it will consolidate them before they change in the air. 
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of Making Incarnated Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched lime: mix the whole well, and sift it; and fill the wound from it, and constrict it with a good constriction until it adheres well upon it, and coagulates with the blood. 
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then constrict it from above with stitches, and leave it alone; and do not loosen it until it remains, so that it does not discharge.  
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not eradicated by medicine until it is healed. 
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone does this when you do not have frankincense at hand, and dragon's blood also makes the same operation in many large wounds, when it is suitable to put it on them and bind them up, and they are recent wounds with their own blood which has not been changed by air. 
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if the air has already changed it somewhat, especially when it is in the summer season, then the application of this powder is not in order; therefore care for it with what we have said, so that you put on it certain digestive ointments: or put on it poultices made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they discharge pus. 
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest with further treatment until they are healed.  
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if it should happen that a fracture occurs in the bone with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps; and I will already say the treatment of skull fractures in what is to come. 
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of wounds of the neck. 
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter Eighty-Five. 
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	But if a wound should happen in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple. 
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy for it except that its treatment be joined with that which produces strong astringency, such as alum and saffron, and those similar to them. 
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they injure nerves and contract them.  
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold at all on the wound; for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is more sublime than other members; and let that with which it is treated be from mild medicines, such as lime slaked with fresh water repeatedly infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty when washed also with fresh water: and the remaining mineral stones in this manner, and soft ointments.  
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then apply a suture; or bring its lips together with lint. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus already collects, then perforate it in a more depressed place within it. 
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	But if an artery has already been incised in the wound and its flow of blood follows: then separate or cauterize it, and bind it; or cauterize it, if necessity compels it to be done so.  
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the spondyles of the throat have already fallen, or the whole thing, and the alhaudig are saved: then join the lips of the skin with a suture over the trachea, and do not touch the throat, rather equalize it, and return it to its natural form. 
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then constrict it with a decent ligature, and leave it for several days.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments which have astringency and desiccation, until it heals. 
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract them all, or as many as you can from them; and what is not prepared, leave it until the wound putrifies, and separates and relieves its exit.  
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	But if the wound is recent, then sprinkle over it the powder which I have described. 
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if bone appears to be seen in the wound and a fistula is formed: then treat it with what its recollection comes to in its chapter. 
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On a Wound on the Fingers.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter Eighty-Six. 
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a strike from a spear or knife and you see its depth, then consider it.  
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	But if windiness comes out from the wound, when a weak person breathes from it, then know that the wound is mortal. 
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep, and fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it up, so that the blood may not be retained in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the sick man; but apply an attractive ointment to it, and dissolve it twice a day. 
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have ointment at hand, then put an old rag in the opening of the wound, so that it may draw out what comes forth from it of moistures; and make the sick man sleep upon the wound, so that what is gathered in it may flow.  
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if three days or more have already passed since the wound, and there does not happen to the sick man spasm, nor evil trembling of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the remaining dispositions of his are good: then know that the wound is well. 
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore take care of it with dressings, and other treatment, until it heals.  
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if its healing is excused, and it is now always open, then know that a fistula has already been made. 
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore take care of it from its own chapter.  
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a sword, or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or back: then take care of it with what preceded from suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small. 
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and chips come out of it: then examine the wound, and hurry to extract those chips, if they are separate.  
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separate, then leave them until the wound putrifies, for their extraction is alleviated then. 
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But judgment in the treatment of other accidents of wounds in the remaining limbs is the judgment that we have said. 
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exiting of intestines, and their issue. 
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII. 
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	Disruption which occurs in the abdomen is great, medium, and small. 
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great disruption, therefore, sometimes intestines or a number of intestines protrude. 
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore their introduction is made, and their suture more vehement and difficult.  
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even a small disruption is difficult in another way. 
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It therefore follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in introducing them to their place immediately; because it swells, opens, and enlarges; therefore its entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Because of this, therefore, a medium disruption is better; because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult as it becomes difficult in these two species. 
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of a vein is according to four methods.  
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common and apply to the suture of the abdomen, and to the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other sutures specifically pertain to the remaining wounds. 
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more appropriate with the suture of the abdomen; and I will explain each one to you with description and explanation. 
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, therefore, that when a wound is small, and something protrudes from it out of the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it; then this is due to one of two methods. 
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said; or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the cold air. 
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then you must warm it, so that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone.  
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you boil in water fennel, papyrus, and saffron and embrace the intestine with it until the inflation is resolved. 
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it makes wine in which there is astringency; and it is better than water alone in resolving inflation.  
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the swelling already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mullein has been boiled. 
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that its entrance is eased with a small thing. 
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the disruption with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut. 
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than a section; and compulsion is not made to cut after necessity and lack of instrument. 
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the subtle end not be with the subtlety of a spatula, rather let it be somewhat duller: and it is that which resembles a chisel, as you see. 
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that there be a reduction of it according to its own natural form in its proper place, if possible above it: for it is better. 
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back and put his legs higher than his head. 
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put his head and chest higher than his lower parts. 
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part. 
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in middle wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you. 
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make a pious minister be present between your hands who will hold the whole disruption with his hand and bring together its lips.  
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it for him who follows a suture something after something; and this is the way of a common single suture.  
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And take a needle, or a sharp-pointed instrument, according to the size of the wound. 
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let fall from the extremity of the disruption the width of a ring finger, that is, of a physician; and fix the needle one span beyond what you are about to introduce the thread into it in two places at the skin, with two extremities of sifac which is under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now joined the two extremities of the skin and the two extremities of sifac; and there become four rows. 
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with a double thread around the needle several times on both sides at once, until the two lips of the wound are joined in a decent manner.  
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let fall the width of a finger also, and fix another needle into them; then draw it tight with thread, just as you did with the first needle. 
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease doing that with as many needles as you need until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.  
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of a medium size between thickness and thinness; for thin needles pierce the flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore it is necessary that they should be medium in thinness and thickness. 
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two extremities of the skin very close together; lest the flesh be pierced quickly and the wound opened before its consolidation, and lest they also be elongated with the suture so as not to prevent the wound from consolidating. 
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the sick man in his sleep; and put little tufts of cloth on all sides to hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already consolidated. 
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this indeed, kind of suture with needles thus is more suitable for small wounds. 
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it suffices in the suture of those, one needle, or two, or about that number.  
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second suture is common, so that the aggregates with the suture join the four ends: two ends of the skin and two ends of the sifac in one stitch, with a needle in which is wrapped a thread equal in subtlety and thickness. 
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four ends, draw back the needle from the part where you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture is like the suture of cloth by which cloths are tied, and place between every suture an amount of thickness less than a finger. 
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	But men know this suture. 
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I healed a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and about two palms had come out from the intestines from the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the belly. 
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore returned it after his bowels had stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours. 
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore consolidated in a space of about fifteen days; and I took care of it, and it was healed; and he lived after that for many years, converted to his own affairs. 
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed. 
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And from a miracle it was, that I did not care for it with ointment.  
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where ointment was not found, nor anything of medicine. 
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I put old linen over the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water until it was healed. 
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But I shall tell two kinds of proper sutures according to the account of speech.  
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture; and you introduce the needle from the outer to the inner part. 
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates into the skin, and into the muscle going according to the length and breadth of the whole body: let the end of the sifac fall in the side in which you introduced the needle, and make the other end penetrate from the inner part to the outer part in the other end marvel.  
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it to penetrate, then make it to penetrate thus in this same extremity, from the exterior part to the interior: and let go the extremity of the sifac, which is on this side, and make the point to penetrate into the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior; and make it to penetrate with your penetration that you make it to penetrate into the sifac extremity, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole. 
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and draw it up with the extremity which is from the sifac on the other side, and extract the point from the skin which it has penetrated. 
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it to that skin, and draw the sifac extremity which is on the other side with this mirach extremity; and extract it from the skin which is from its part, and do that vice versa, one after another: and do that vice versa, until you have drawn out all its extrinsic part according to that example. 
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that its suture should be like the sutures of skinners, so that its sifac vice versa on one side with one extremity of skin; and that you should let it go vice versa on the other side, until you complete it.  
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture, which Galen mentioned. 
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His speech is narrated so that its suture should be according to the similarity which some physicians have, in such a way that they bring together all the part to its fitting counterpart by nature: and they apply the sifac extremity to its other extremity, and the mirach extremity to its other extremity. 
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you. 
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix the point into the mirach extremity nearest to you from the exterior part, and make it penetrate to the interior in that alone; and let go the two sifac extremities. 
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the point, and make it penetrate from the exterior part to the interior into the two sifac extremities, namely on both sides. 
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, and also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two extremities of the other side. 
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture of which a reminder preceded. 
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the speech of Galen. 
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said. 
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is corrected with two needles. 
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is, to insert one thread into both of them; and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is at your side, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who are skins equally. 
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than that of the other places of the belly. 
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	But the judgment of the medication of a wound, is the judgment of other wounds.  
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air changes it; and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and fit it; then place powder of incarnating on top. 
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already changed the wound: then place some ointments, which are present to you, on top of it until they make pus; and the threads fall off, and the sifac and mirach become consolidated. 
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it as is the care of other wounds, until it is healed. 
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if medicines are not present to you, then immediately place on it, from which it begins to emit pus, old cot; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed. 
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.  
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound communicates to the principal members in injury, then it is necessary for you to immerse soft wool in oil of tempered heat, or in rose oil; and place it in the circumference of the places which are between the groins, and under the armpits.  
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or pricking, or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens) then give him an enema with dark, thick, warm wine; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and is about to penetrate to its cavity. 
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what is from the small intestines is harder to heal. 
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called Jejunum does not admit healing from a wound that happens in it at all; and this is because of its multitude, which is of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves. 
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if what proceeds from the wound is a protuberance, and you obtain it fresh; reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally. 
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if a space has passed for it, and it has already become green, or black; then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which has been darkened from it, so that flow of blood does not occur. 
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a protuberance are veins and arteries. 
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it; so that relief comes upon you from its attraction, and extraction of itself in case of the protuberance, and emission of pus from the wound. 
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Recollection of a Wound That Happens in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small; then it is possible that it may be restored in some people: therefore, because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a thrust of a spear, and the wound was from the right of the stomach, and the wound was old; and a fistula was made, and there issued from it discharge, and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied treatment until I was no longer anxious about its healing; nor did I cease to dress it carefully until it was healed and the place consolidated. 
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place was already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, lest some evil accident should befall him in his belly; and no such evil accident befell him. 
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in a better state of health, eating and drinking, and sleeping soundly, and he entered the bath, and exercised himself in his daily routines. 
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And certain experimenters have now said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, then it ought to be ligated in this manner. 
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one ant with an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound. 
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When its head is thus upon them and it clenches its jaws, cut off its head; for it adheres and will not be loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the total extent of the wound. 
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then bind it up and its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads will remain attached within the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm will befall the sick man inwardly.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is now possible that the intestine may also be ligated with a fine thread; which has been drawn out from the intestine of an animal and attached to it after it has been introduced into a needle. 
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you should take the end of this thread from the intestine and it should be scraped off very much. 
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread around its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into a needle and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then bind it up in its dressing. 
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with thread and gut is not except according to the way of trust and hope. 
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no skill except refinement, and there is no healing of it at all. 
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of fistulae and ulcers. 
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter Eighty-Eight. 
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and becomes chronic, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and is not cut off: then it is called universally wherever it may be a fistula, and we call it a zulchemen. 
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is according to truth a knotted filtration, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and on account of that some call it risata, that is, a feather. 
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours moist, which emits pus. 
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is split in certain hours. 
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and is little: and it is thick, and it is subtle. 
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I already stated previously in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor is flesh born in it, it is not except because of one of nine new causes. 
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its malice; or because between it and on its lips there is hard flesh, prohibiting the birth of flesh; or because it is full of much filth and dirtiness; or because the ulcer in itself is putrid, and the material which is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment; or because corruption falling into the region is a pestilential kind; or through a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which digestion of illnesses becomes difficult, and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones in it. 
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here for me to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand. 
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore know that Fistula occurs in all the members of the body. 
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are Fistulas which reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed of composition; such as the hand, and foot: and from them are those which go to the proximity of the principal member, and similar ones.  
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which therefore of these Fistulas is in this way, is from illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is toil and ignorance. 
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from Fistulas some of whose depth does not reach these places which I said: and you hope, and trust in its treatment, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and explore it with it. 
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is crookedness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.  
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead because of the gentleness of its body is relieved, and curves around the crookedness. 
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a probe.  
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore cleanse from them an opening out of its openings. 
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you cleanse it, goes towards the other openings, and runs from them.  
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to what way it is possible for you: that you may know that there is a bone, or nerve, and the Fistula's concavity is distant, or near: or that the Fistula is single which has many openings, and stand upon all of it, with your utmost strength: with inquiry on your part, by which you question the sick person, and discovery of pain at pressure with your hand upon the place, and similar ones from signs and causes happening to a boil. 
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have stood upon all these true stations, then go to the cure according to confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if there is a fistula nearby apparent, or in a safe place far from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the fistula according to what has been said in my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in its orifice from flesh, or thelul, and similar things: and care for it until it heals. 
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of distant depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it deeply as much as is possible for you. 
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupt flesh. 
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer linen wrapped in sharp medicines: and insert it up to the concavity of the fistula which you comprehended with iron: do this repeatedly with it until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from corruption. 
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it heals.  
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated. 
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	Therefore if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and it is made certain to you: then inquire into it and cut it according to what I have narrated to you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or main member as we said. 
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore the bone is revealed to you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which makes flesh upon it until it heals. 
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	But if it does not heal and emits pus as it was doing: then know that you have not reached the total eradication of the corruption. 
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore reveal it again, and make a careful examination of it, and cleanse it with your ultimate strength. 
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it yourself. 
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	Therefore if it heals, it is good; and if not, then you will know that corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached. 
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore there is no skill for you in it except to leave it to nature. 
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if the mouth of a young child is corrupted and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suited to it. 
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then make a careful drawing out of them all, and do not leave anything behind with your strength. 
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if something opposes you from the humors and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut into those humors and flesh if they are there and free the bones. 
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you do not have preparation for taking out the bones at your time, then place over the wound what will cause it to decay itself; and leave it until that which is around those bones decays from flesh and humors. 
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And see that the wound does not solidify. 
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision which you made in your operation be tightened.  
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Rather place over it, if you fear, a cloth steeped in sulfur ground with oil; or a cloth steeped in Egyptian ointment, or some emerald ointments. 
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors decay and separate from the bones, removal and their drawing out are eased.  
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the hip bone and similar to these, and what is corrupted from it is a large part; then scrape it with the last resort until that blackness and corruption are removed.  
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound. 
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached; then care for it until it heals. 
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you about a man who had a wound on his leg: so that you may take it as an example and aid for your operation. 
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years old, to whom pain occurred in his leg from a cause which had moved upon him within the body, that is, from within; until the matter reached his leg and there formed a large abscess: and he did not have an external cause. 
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Time was extended with him in error of the physicians until the abscess was opened and much matter flowed from it. 
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed until his leg became fistulated and many openings were made in it; which all emitted pus and the body's humors. 
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one wise in the art of the hand among them until I was called upon and saw his leg and the materials which were flowing from those openings with a great flow: indeed, the whole body of the man had already wasted away, and his color was citron. 
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore I introduced a probe into one of the openings and it reached the bone. 
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings and found that they reached each other from all parts of the leg.  
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I hastened then and cut above one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted, which had already been corroded and blackened, and putrefied, and was perforated until it penetrated to the marrow.  
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I sawed off what was revealed to me and prepared it from the corrupted bone. 
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I determined that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption which I had cut off and sawed.  
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And now I had eradicated it. 
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines over a long space.  
Et non est consolidatum.	And it did not consolidate. 
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed and found above the second opening, above the first discovery, a continuous corruption with bone; and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption. 
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried its restoration. 
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored. 
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I discovered above it again and did not cease to cut the bone into pieces and try its restoration; and it was not restored until I cut about a palm from the bone and extracted it with its marrow. 
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medications and it quickly consolidated and healed; and this iteration was not necessary in its operation and section except for the weakness of the sick person's constitution, and his lack of tolerance, and my fear for him regarding death: because he suffered from evil syncopes in all hours from excess evacuation. 
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore healed with complete healing; and firm flesh grew in place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned; and he returned to his former conditions; and it did him no harm at all in walking. 
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the protruding bone in the body is already broken, then it is necessary to saw it according to this method; and it is: to take a ligament and tie it at the end of the protruding bone; and instruct someone to extend it upward; and put another ligament made of coarse wool after the first ligament. 
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh downwards; and you expose the flesh above the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.  
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the bone below decently; because when you do this, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.  
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the saw be over the corrupted place for a short time so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone; and it does not appear to the sense in its appearance and compels it to the vice of its own juice.  
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the mouth is corrupted and is not prominent but continues with its part, and the corruption is in its middle or in a part of it, then expose all the flesh from all sides. 
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood underneath. 
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the saw continues on the other side; and let the saw be according to the length of the corruption a little further, as we have said. 
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	But if the corruption is at the junction, cut the corrupt junction itself, and saw the mouth where it continues on the other side. 
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then there is no artifice in it except abrasion. 
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	But if the corruption is in the comb of the hand or in the comb of the foot, then the matter is very difficult. 
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary for you to inquire how the corruption appears to you. 
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever artifice is rectified for you: when it does not cause opposition to you by vein or nerve. 
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many cutting and sawing instruments for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and magnitude, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for that operation of every species.  
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you above the kind of instrument with which you are in need when you have a long study. 
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of illnesses; for then you will already find by yourself what suits it from the instruments for every infirmity. 
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I affirm to you in the last of this chapter a number of instruments which you put examples on which you cut and a test by which you try on others. 
Forma Serrae.	Shape of a Saw. 
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another Saw. 
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another Saw. 
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another Saw. 
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of a saw should be made carefully. 
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be sharpness from iron; and let its handle be from boxwood, and let it be pyramidally made carefully.  
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of a Scraper for Joining. 
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this scraper be according to the form of the head of a star-shaped nail; and let its points be according to the form of the points of an elishegife. 
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not fitting except that the heads of joins be rubbed with it when they are corrupted or when a wide and large mouth is present. 
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of a Larger Scraper. 
Forma medii Rasorii.	Shape of a Medium Scraper.  
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of a Wide Scraper. 
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of a Scraper in which there is a Concavity. 
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of another subtle Scraper.  
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of another scraper with a curved extremity. 
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of a small, subtle tenaculum scraper. 
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of a Scraper with which bones are incised. 
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape also of a large scraper. 
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a Rasp, and its extremity is like a Saw: it is exhibited in many places for the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of a scraper which suits the reason of that which is perforated from bones.  
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and its extremities are sharp. 
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from India.   
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all which we have said be made from Scrapers and Cutters and Saws. 
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of extremities and the Locking of Bones. 
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter Eighty-Nine. 
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy either from an external or internal cause. 
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with medical care, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption fall upon a limb which it does not affect: then it is necessary that you cut into that limb until you reach the corruption, so that the sick person may be delivered from death, or from the evil which is greater by the loss of the limb. 
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this happening is that the limb becomes dark, until it seems as though fire has burned it, or it rots after the blackness: until that putrefaction is cut down to what follows that limb, and crawls into the whole body. 
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore hasten with the incision of it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures: such as a sea scorpion, and viper, and asp, and the like.  
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption, or sting is in the extremity of a finger, then cut into the finger, and do not allow space for the corruption to advance as far as the rest of the hand. 
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut into it from the root of the forearm, and do not allow space for the corruption until it reaches the forearm. 
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades that, then cut into the arm at the elbow joint.  
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then death is upon the sick person. 
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And besides that from treatment, the quantity of strength is to be administered.  
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do similarly with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it seizes the arch of the foot, then cut into the whole foot. 
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.  
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	And if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no wisdom in it except dismissal, and to leave the sick person to death. 
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	The manner of cutting a limb, or sewing it up, is to tie a ligature below the part you wish to cut and tie another ligature above the place. 
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	Let one assistant extend one ligature downwards, and let another assistant extend another ligature upwards. 
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures with a broad Spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.  
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it may be cut, or sewn up. 
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And you must place linen cloths on all sides, and let the saw not touch the healthy part; and it should happen that a weak additional injury is inflicted, and a warm poultice applied. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if internal bleeding should happen while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put some powders that staunch blood upon it. 
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.  
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage for it, and care for it until it heals. 
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, the same accident that I am telling you about.  
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Which is because a blackness occurred in his foot, with a burn that resembles fire's combustion; and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot. 
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man hastened from himself, after he saw the corruption cutting into his limb with its violence, which he found out from the pain and the burning of it; and he cut it at the joint, and was healed.  
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. 
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He therefore came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body; and the excess was not repelled, and it began to advance into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.  
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called upon me to cut his hand; and I refused to do so, hoping that excess superfluity might pass from him on its own: and I also feared for him, lest he should die at the incision of his hand. 
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was beyond the case. 
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	When therefore he despaired of me, he returned to his own land; and it was reported to me concerning him that, hastening, he fell upon his whole hand, and he was healed. 
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not related this narrative except that it may be a help concerning what falls upon the nature of this illness; and that it may be a sign by which it is signified, and according to which it is acted.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the Treatment of Sinuses, and the Quality of Clysters with Medicines. 
Caput XC.	Chapter Ninety.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess extends until it collects pus; then it bursts or is perforated, and what is in it issues forth as pus, and a vacant place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin that is over it is like a cloth that has already been attenuated: and the corruption does not proceed to its final stage, nor does it press into the mouth, nor into a nerve, nor into a ligament; it deserves to be called a Sinus and not a Fistula. However, if the space of it extends until the corruption presses into any one of these members, then it is called a Fistula or a zuken.  
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut all that skin as it revolves; and especially when it has become attenuated and made like a cloth; and you trust because it does not adhere to the place on account of its corruption. 
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and the last corruption does not follow from it; and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with a clyster; and it is, that you consider the Sinus. 
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it is of a foul odor: then cleanse it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, mix them in a vessel; and decoct them over fire until the medicine reddens; and comes to the thickness of honey. 
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it as much as you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the Sinus with it; and constrict its opening, and let the medicine remain in it for the space of two hours. 
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure; do this for as many days as necessary until the Sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed. 
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes cleanse with ash water, when you do not have this medicine present; and it is such that you should take ash from vine wood, or ash from holly wood; and pour water over it.  
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and cleanse with it until you are confident that the Sinus is already cleansed. 
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	And if the weak person cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine nor ash water, then cleanse it with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed. 
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cleanse it with honey and wine mixed together, since honey has the property of cleansing and washing; and wine makes the Sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine. 
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the Sinus corruption has already been removed; then cleanse it with something that promotes flesh growth in it.  
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is such that you should take some dyafinicon plaster; and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or cleanse it with certain medicines, and other ointments, the properties of which I have written in the treatise on ointments.  
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	And if the opening of the Sinus is narrow, in which the enema cannula does not fit: then widen it a little with iron; or place in it a licorice root wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or basil ointment until it widens.  
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with suture: and let out from it a quantity into which an enema may enter without addition. 
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus flows is raised upwards: then dry it up in a lower place which is in it so that pus may flow from it downwards: because pus when constricted in the depth of the sinus prevents flesh from being generated in it. 
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	And if it is not possible for you to dry up the sinus approximately below it according to your wish: then try, so that you prepare the limb with preparation so that pus may flow from it easily according to how it is prepared for you.  
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are put upon a sign, suitable to what you wish. 
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them upon linen cloth. 
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that communication of the whole sinus is made.  
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps a hole straight in the orifice of the sinus, a little wider than the orifice of the sinus. 
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from soft ointments upon another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and put it upon that one in a position distant from the orifice of the sinus so that the flow of pus from it may be relieved: and do not remove the large cloth except after several days at once.  
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one which is upon the orifice of the sinus is the one which you remove every hour so that what collects in it from pus may exit: and so that you may know whether what flows from it is much or little: or digested or undigested. 
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself whether the master thereof feels pain in it or there is no pain in it: and whether there is an abscess in it or not. 
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication proceeds thus, and you see the matter which flows out upon the orifice of the sinus: then you will know that the sinus is already adhering or approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound then change another cloth and renew the ointment. 
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if after a long time a subtle virus comes out of the sinus, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since there are some people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are others who act contrary to that. 
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if after many days purulent matter undigested comes out of the sinus, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere. 
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	Therefore if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged: then add to its drying medicines, so that they may be humid in their substance and dry in their power, such as diaphicinum ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it. 
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And of the last things by which it is cured, is to take diaphicinum ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and pour over it old wine equal in its substance. 
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that and use it. 
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it, now does a similar action to this, when diaphicinum ointment is not present to you.  
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh and aloe and frankincense: grind the whole thing and sprinkle it over honey while it is over the fire. 
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then put a cloth over it and bind it over the sinus: and smear with the honey that you have boiled until it has thickened: and sprinkle spices over it, and put a cloth over it and bind it.  
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long aristolochia is administered in it, and the roots of the lily and there is a lily: and herb flour, and centaury. 
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simply or combined, grind them, and sift them through a sieve: and sprinkle over the honey that I have described, and use it. 
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged and does not heal by this treatment, then know that there is corruption in its depths: or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the remaining hard members, or ligaments: then cure it with the treatment for fistulas, according to what has been previously stated.  
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of whitlow and a crushed nail, and cutting into an added finger, and sectioning. 
Caput XCI.	Chapter Ninety-One. 
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot; and perhaps it arises in the remaining fingers. 
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	Therefore when the matter thereof prolongs, and its care is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess; or it corrupts, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts it altogether, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor; and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark. 
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it, as we said in the division, and your treatment does not succeed; then it is necessary that you cut with an iron the whole superfluity which remained from the nail. 
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that. 
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cautery is very helpful.  
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	But if the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin Radium under an angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut into the flesh with ease, and place upon what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, corrosive ones, until all of it is removed. 
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.  
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption already presses into the bone, then it is necessary that you cut into the bone, and extract it; for it never heals while a corrupted bone remains in it. 
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	And if you see the erosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one node, according to what has been previously mentioned about it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals. 
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, attrition or percussion should befall a nail, and there should be intense pain in it, then it is necessary first to let blood from a weak person. 
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatulum and make a transverse cut upwards. 
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause intense pain through it to a weak person, and it will be the cause of added growth of flesh in that place. 
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with something that relieves pain. 
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	An added finger that is born in some men's hands, perhaps it is all fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them; and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of a joint, or its birth is in some knots of the finger.  
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that is born in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that is born at a joint of the finger perhaps moves.  
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the section of the fleshy one of these is easy. 
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is to say, you should cut it off at its root with a broad spatulum.  
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the treatment of the one whose birth is at the root of a joint is difficult. 
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from cutting it.  
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in the one that is born in a finger at the last knot, then you must first cut its flesh with a round incision down to the bone. 
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that purpose.  
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals. 
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Consolidation that happens between the fingers often happens either from the birth of a man, that is, he is born with it, or from consolidation of a wound, or from burning by fire and similar things. 
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form. 
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place cloths between them, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not join quickly and separate them; or put a thin sheet of lead between them until the place is consolidated as needed. 
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the limb. 
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the Incision of a Blemish.  
Caput XCII.	Chapter Ninety-Two. 
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Varicose veins are large, full veins affected by excess melancholic humors which occur in many parts of the body; and their occurrence is most common in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, workers, and carriers. 
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a strong flogging with a black whip several times. 
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then phlebotomize the patient from those veins.  
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of them with iron is according to two methods. 
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cut and black blood is extracted. 
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein is raised and entirely removed.  
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it is according to this method. 
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First embrocate the leg with plenty of hot water until the thick feculent blood is resolved.  
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the infirm's leg from the upper part of their hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage. 
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, with a wide incision. 
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise it, that is, draw the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and the phlebotomist should first phlebotomize the infirm person at the top. 
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the vein further down until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient and which the strength of the infirm person can tolerate. 
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it; and order him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and this is harmful to the weak one. 
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its elevation however is in this way. 
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the sick person, if there are many hairs on it. 
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce it into a bath; or embrocate it on his leg with hot water, until it reddens and the veins swell; or exercise it with strenuous exercise, if a bath is not present for him, until the limb heats up. 
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin directly at the vein section lengthwise; or at its last part near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.  
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and expose the vein from all sides, until it appears to the senses; and at its appearance, you see it reddish towards a dark decline. 
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it comes out of the skin, you see it white as if it were a chord.  
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert a trocar beneath it until it is raised and comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blunt hook, gentle one. 
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision near that incision with three fingers.  
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then expose the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears. 
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with trocars as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first. 
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision, or several more incisions, if it seems necessary to you.  
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise it and cut it with the last incision near the heel. 
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the incision that is above it.  
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you extract it from the incision that is above, or higher incisions altogether, until it comes out completely; then cut it. 
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you to be drawn out and raised: then introduce a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and draw it out; or introduce a radium under it, and turn your hand in every direction until it comes out. 
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware that it does not fall in. 
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it falls in, it becomes difficult for you to raise it greatly, and harm comes upon the weak one from it. 
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have drawn it all out, then place wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil over the place of the wound, and care for it until it is healed. 
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the thorn is contracted, having a twist with an involution to the parts, and is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you split it above it on every part of its twist, and the places of its involution. 
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you raise it all; and beware at your section above it that you do not fall upon a vein, or wound it; for it will become difficult for you to raise, or draw it out.  
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence. 
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of a Falling Thorn by Which It Is Healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of a blind thorn. 
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curvature like the other thorns, nor is it of a sharp point, so that it does not wound a vein; and it is of a thick, gentle flexuousness; for if it were slender, it would fall upon a vein by its slenderness: but rather let it be excessively thick as we said. 
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of a Vein of the Leg.  
Caput XCIII.	Chapter Ninety-Three. 
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Andalus and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness; that is, those in which grass, nor trees are born.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it arises in other places of the body besides the legs. 
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, just as snakes and ascaris worms occur within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and flesh. 
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this event of this Vein is, that a vehement inflammation occurs in the leg. 
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place blisters.  
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the Vein begins to come out from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal. 
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore when its extremity appears from it, it is necessary that you wrap upon it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one drachma to two drachmas, and bind it firmly: and let the lead hang suspended from the leg. 
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore anything comes out from it to the outside, wrap that in lead and bind it.  
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	And if it is prolonged much, then cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder. 
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it entirely before it all comes out.  
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess to occur, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.  
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be handled gently and be drawn out gradually until it comes out from its last part, and nothing remains from it in the body: and from this indeed Vein there comes out in some men what is in its length five palms and ten. 
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already come to me that it came out of a man twenty palms long.  
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you in the hour of your medication: then insert a ray into its foramen, and pierce it with a long foramen, along with its body, until all that is in it from matter is evacuated: and administer putrefaction to the place with medicines for several days.  
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of it with the treatment of abscesses. 
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself; and it has many openings, and a branch goes out from every opening. 
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore care for it as we said in the division, and with that which was stated before.  
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the cutting out of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine disease. 
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter Ninety-Fourth. 
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called Bovine Disease in a certain land among us; because it very often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh. 
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the whole body, ascending and descending; and it is shown to the senses by its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts wherever it bursts in the skin and comes out. 
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.  
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and snakes happen, that is, earthworms and roundworms in the belly. 
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its harmfulness.  
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it wanders through the body and rises to the head and reaches a place, then perhaps it opens there and comes out and destroys the eye; and that happens very often. 
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it and extract it, then it is not done except when it wanders and appears to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature constriction. 
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it. 
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	But if it burrows into the flesh and you do not find it: then place a cautery with fire upon the spot until it dies. 
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater thing that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind a good ligature under it above the eyebrow. 
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it. 
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person use cleansing of his body with medicines dissolving foul and bad humors. 
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction. 
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning incision for the ailment Nakir.  
Caput XCV.	Chapter Ninety-Fifth. 
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain which occurs in certain members, then it is transformed from member to member. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have indeed already seen it, according to what I relate to you.  
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was summoned to an infirm woman in certain ulcers. 
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	She exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm cord.  
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for an hour, I saw one swelling advance with a burning sensation, just as a worm advances, ascending to her shoulder faster than it is possible: so that it is like living silver, when it runs from place to place.  
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain withdrew from that place and was fixed in the shoulder. 
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.  
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she narrated to me that it revolved throughout her whole body, according to what I saw. 
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore I marveled at the swiftness of its transformation from member to member.  
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed before that, I had not seen this ailment with my own eyes in such a manner.   
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who found pain to be transformed from member to member, and I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman. 
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is anything but because the woman was from those who are of dry bodies with exposed veins, therefore that swiftness appears to the senses.  
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this method in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, hidden veins. 
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	Therefore when you wish its cure and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you by eye as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until that wind shall go out constricted: and cauterize the place. 
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body and with that which expels winds and drives them out with foul pills and pills of Serapina and similar ones. 
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Concerning the Extraction of Arrows.  
Caput XCVI.	Chapter Ninety-Six.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body. 
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is this: since some of them have large points and small ones: and concave ones and deaf ones.  
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some of them have three angles. 
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some of them have tongues. 
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some of them have stars. 
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to the limbs in which they fall are according to two ways.  
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the limbs are from the principal concave limbs such as the brain and heart and liver and lung and kidneys and intestines and bladder and those similar to them.  
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore when it falls into any of these limbs and the signs of death appear to you which I will tell you after then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them for death follows him in whom it is in many dispositions. 
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these evil signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb then draw it out and care for the wound. 
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the mouth and exits through the nasal passage which is above the brain are: because vehement spasms and dimness of vision and vertigo and redness in the eyes and swelling and redness of the tongue and spasm and confusion of mind and vomiting with cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will issue from the nostrils, or ears. 
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed. 
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there issues from the place of the wound a white moisture like pus. 
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there comes forth from it something like the wateriness of flesh.  
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come forth. 
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple; and he feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a hollow thing. 
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse; and black blood flows from the wound. 
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following that is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.  
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death descends without doubt. 
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it has wounded the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels which follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the sick person changes.  
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, deep sigh; and he seeks the attraction of cold air. 
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	But if the arrow falls into the membrane which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great panting with violent pain, with a sigh; and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved. 
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food will issue from the wound.  
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed there, something like dung will issue from the wound, or phlegm, or intestine which has already been broken.  
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope in its treatment, nor in the extraction of the arrow.  
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes forth; and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger upon the sick person: then know that it is mortal.  
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, armpit, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, hip, thigh, and similar limbs are saved according to multiple arrangements: when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve; and the arrow is not poisonous. 
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen about these arrows so that you may understand through it concerning your treatment. 
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is this, because an arrow fell to a certain man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose. 
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extracted it from him on the other side, under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye. 
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen to him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already concealed, and I did not obtain from it except a small part of it with which it adheres to its wood; and it was a large arrow from the arrows of Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears. 
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore the Jew was healed, and no bad accident befell his eye.  
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian. 
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the one which has ears. 
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore made a cut above it between two folds; and it was already submerged in his throat. 
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I proceeded delicately with it until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it. 
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed him, and nothing changed in his condition, I made a cut above the arrow; and I devised something about it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no bad accident befell him. 
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound had healed over it. 
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Seven years afterward, the arrow emerged from the root of his hip. 
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen on her abdomen, and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and nothing changed in her disposition, and the woman did not find harm from it in any of her natural operations. 
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen on his face: and the wound healed, and it remained, not finding much pain from it: and similar things to these many. 
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen to him in the middle of his nose, and was now inclined toward his right side a little: and the arrow was entirely concealed.  
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore summoned for his treatment after the fall of the arrow up to three days. 
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the wound of the arrow very tight.  
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore inquired for it with a subtle probe, and did not feel it; and he himself indeed found a puncture and pain under his right ear. 
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that this puncture was from the extremity of the arrow.  
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore plastered the place with a plaster in which there was attractive and digestive power, trusting within myself that the place would become inflamed and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I might cut above it: and nothing happened in the place indicating that the arrow had reached the location. 
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore persisted with the plaster upon him for many days: and nothing happened, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained weak about its extraction for a space of days, until he felt the arrow one day within his nose. 
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he related this to me.  
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore placed sharp, corrosive medicine upon the wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt the slender extremity of the arrow adhering to the wood. 
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine until the extremity of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and it took me about four months with this. 
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to coming out: then I did not cease to refine and contrive upon it with various ingenious methods until on a certain day I began upon it with forceps skillfully made, according to how their form will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.  
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound. 
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.  
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it and the wound became consolidated and he was healed with perfect health: and nothing harmed him at all. 
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I relate to you the quality of extracting certain arrows so that you may establish a rule and meaning upon that which I have not said. 
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration; nor does this book comprehend it, and a prudent craftsman compares a little with much; and with that which is present, with that which is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of these foreign matters of this art when they happen. 
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that arrows do not come out from the limbs in which they are fixed except according to two ways.  
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either by attraction from the place from which it entered. 
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or contrary to the other part.  
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place and it is attracted and comes out.  
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	And if it does not yield to coming out at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you let it alone for several days until the flesh which is around it putrefies and its attraction is relieved and its exit.  
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to you for removal, then leave it also for several days: and repeat it with attraction and motion every day, until it comes out. 
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	But if it does not yield to you for removal after several days, then it is necessary that you perforate in the circumference of the arrow in the bone itself from every part with a fine awl, until the arrow is enlarged. 
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out and extract it. 
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already passed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents which I have mentioned appear from weakness: then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it until its being equals after several days.  
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him. 
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach: and he remains weak for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then apply yourself to drawing out the arrow and extracting it.  
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed very firmly and does not yield to you for drawing: then administer awls around the arrow as I have described above: then care for the place until it heals. 
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already concealed in a place in the body and hidden from sensation: then inquire for it with your hand. 
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for drawing it. 
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot get hold of it because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is neither bone nor nerve nor vein there: then probe over it until the wound is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow. 
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if there are ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every part with all your skill: and apply yourself, if it is not possible to get hold of the flesh in the fracture of the ears and their twisting until it comes out. 
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use twisting of your hand with forceps on all sides, until you make it come out; and with subtle finesse, so that the arrow is not broken, and its attraction and extraction become difficult for you. 
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	And if you are not able to get it out within one hour, then leave it for several days, until that which is around it becomes putrid. 
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it; for then the tension will be eased. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said about care in its chapter; and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or cord. 
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer ingenuity in every way possible to you for the evasion of the arrow; and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you. 
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you make, when you draw out the arrow, it be weak according to the shape according to which it was at the time of the arrow's case itself.  
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more beneficial. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from shapes.  
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But an arrow which comes out from the opposite side of the other, or already proceeds something from it to the outside; or makes a hump at the end of the arrow by feeling from the upper part of the nearby skin and you see it prominent: then cut above it, and let the incision be according to the amount that your forceps can grasp in it. 
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out; for it itself becomes easy for exit.  
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held fast in bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow presses into the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out. 
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for several days; then repeat it until it comes out. 
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the wood of the arrow is in it, then drive it out with that. 
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood has fallen out and you wish to apply pressure: then insert a concave instrument into it so that it enters the cavity of its tail; then drive it out with it.  
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave, then drive it out with an instrument entering into it. 
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by that. 
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you scoop out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so. 
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for that.  
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	But if an arrow falls into the chest, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side: and it is near from what you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be cautious of cutting a vein, or a nerve, and extract it. 
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound, if you see it necessary, and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted. 
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be like a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grasp onto an arrow, they do not release it. 
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds are made from them, large and small and medium, according to the size, slenderness, and width of the wound and its tightness. 
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of a concave pusher. 
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of a deaf pusher.  
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is so that the extremity of the deaf one is like a spoke, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased and it can be driven out with it.

Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true because around them are small, black veins. 
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, cut both with an incident incision.  
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt upon you and you do not know which of them it is, then attend to the incision of the larger ones and the more manifest. 
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins that are in the upper lip; and indeed, custom most often runs with this; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.  
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning phlebotomy of the Vein under the Tongue after Phlebotomy of the Cephalic Vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for premonitions which are in the throat and pain of the uvula and pains of the mouth. 
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that the weak person should sit between your hands before the sun and lift up their tongue, and look under the tongue from one side for a vein and from their other side a vein; and the color of both inclining towards blackness. 
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore phlebotomize both: and take care not to insert your hand in phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries and perhaps it may happen that a flow of blood comes from those arteries.  
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the Three Veins in the Elbow. 
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are those in whom phlebotomy runs with custom in all people. 
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy of them is done according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by puncturing with a wide myrtle phlebotome or an olive-shaped one inclined to subtlety; or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is called Alnesil. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, which is suitable for sectioning. 
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of these there are wide and subtle kinds according to the width of the veins and their firmness. The myrtle phlebotome's form is wide as you see. 
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave veins, full, proceeding, apparent, large, and those which contain thick, cloudy blood. 
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotome is of lesser width and more subtle extremity.  
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it suits the phlebotomy of subtle veins which contain thin, yellow blood. 
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Basiliac.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But the Basiliac, which is one of these three veins, is a help for phlebotomy. 
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and the belly; and it suits the phlebotomist with a phlebotome to approach it carefully and be fearful of it because under it is an artery. 
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.  
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to phlebotomize it with a puncturing phlebotome but rather to cut it with Alnesil. 
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	But if the Basiliac does not appear by a manifest appearance, then it is necessary that someone else find it and change to another vein or seek some branch of it; or a phlebotome in place of it on the Brachium. 
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it itself is manifest, and cut it with the phlebotome Alnesil, as we said. 
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to phlebotomize the same, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, to touch the place until you know the place of the pulse. 
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with a cautery, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using an Alnesil lancet as we have said. 
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And take care that the percussion does not fall through the space from the place of the artery. 
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with a cautery, then that swelling is swelling of the artery; therefore avoid it. 
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	And if you see the blood rise at the phlebotomy like the urine of a child and it is subtle, reddish blood; then you know that it is from arterial blood. 
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then hasten, and place your finger upon the space longways, then remove your finger. 
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then tighten the arm and release it; and let the weak one beware of its movement; and let there be fear upon him. 
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move it for several days until it heals.  
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not cut off and overcomes you and you do not have medicine present to you at that moment, then cut into the artery if it appears to you. 
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted and the blood is cut off.  
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a pistachio nut and shred it; take one half and tighten it upon the place of the vein with a decent constriction, with a ligature and poultices up to another day. 
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with that of which a previous remembrance proceeded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood; and the incision of its blood is not difficult in many constitutions because of the small place of the wound and the possibility of a ligature from the arm. 
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Concerning the Phlebotomy of the Fuscous Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins of the temples are beneficial for phlebotomy, because they draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilary vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said. 
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to make an incision on it above fear of cutting during phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve. 
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore if he adds to the puncture during phlebotomy and finds a nerve, there occurs in it numbness and healing becomes difficult and perhaps it does not heal completely. 
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses. 
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and does not appear, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy so that the phlebotomist makes a section with Alnesil and avoids nerves with your strength. 
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves then find the vein in length. 
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Concerning the Cephalic Vein. 
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The Cephalic vein is beneficial for phlebotomy because it draws blood from the head and carries it to illnesses of the eyes. 
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially if you wish, for the phlebotomist to pierce it with an olive phlebotome or a myrtle phlebotome; because it is the safest of all veins because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it. 
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However it is fitting for you during phlebotomy to avoid the head of the lizard with the phlebotome and seek a gentler place; and it does not harm it if it is not found in the first percussion to go over it several times with the phlebotome. 
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However perhaps it may become inflamed in some people when it is not pierced in the first percussion but that inflammation does not harm it at all. 
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the Utility of Phlebotomy and Precautions to be Observed Therein. 
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality and incidents of phlebotomy are derived from it; you must consider its correction. 
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Therefore, first of all, you must know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health and its perseverance, and precaution against the advent of diseases. 
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy may be performed in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely, the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilica. 
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy may be performed at the beginning of Spring on a fast, in summer and autumn; and winter after a meal, when the signs of repletion appear. 
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed. 
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy which is administered in diseases does not have a determined hour; but when necessity and convenience call for it, by night or day, at any hour and time. 
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And children should not be subjected to phlebotomy until they reach fourteen years of age.  
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be subjected to phlebotomy except from the fourth to the seventh month. 
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men who have already passed sixty years be subjected to phlebotomy.  
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone desires to undergo phlebotomy for whatever reason it may be, they must purify their bowels before phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is much retained feces in them so that the veins do not draw off foul and harmful superfluities from the intestines during phlebotomy. 
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient be subjected to phlebotomy when they are full, that is, experiencing nausea; nor intoxicated, nor recovering from drunkenness until that has been removed from them. 
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one weak with dropsy. 
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And beware of phlebotomy again after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, increased intercourse, labor, exertion, wakefulness, fasting, and anything that dissolves virtue from the bodily or animal substance. 
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtleties of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible to thin it. 
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should enter a bath, if nothing forbids it: or he should exercise with some exertion, so that the blood becomes thinner. 
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and try, so that his chest is evacuated that day from all animal evils: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily evils, such as labor, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and those similar.  
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let the things with which he is accustomed to use be present in his seat: from sweetness and smell and joy and those similar as much as possible. 
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the one being bled: then let him draw out his arm and rub it with his hand twice or three times.  
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie a ligature with strips of linen and wrap it twice. 
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal or by excess in the constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in relaxation, then it also prevents the flow of blood. 
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction it is necessary that the one being bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and make themselves known to the sense. 
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the phlebotomist clean the one being bled with a little oil, preferably old. 
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the very vein under the place where he wishes to perform the phlebotomy, a little: so that the vein does not flee and percussion occurs. 
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because from the veins there are some like a fleeing chord at phlebotomy: and among them are those which are full of windiness: and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet and deceives the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is constricted: therefore for this reason it is necessary that the phlebotomist be steady and attentive to all these things. 
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then let him lay down the phlebotomist. 
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	Therefore if a vein is opened from one side, then it is good. 
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that on another side a little below or above it with speed: if the place does not become inflamed. 
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it becomes inflamed or weak and swells, then let him go for a day or two days: and let him not tighten the ligature.  
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will draw in a hot inflammation. 
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let him not enter a bath. 
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat the bloodletting if he wishes. 
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small or the blood flows subtly: and you fear that the quantity of blood will not come out as you wish: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to straightness, and add a little in the operation.  
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with speed before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many men at a small operation. 
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	Therefore if you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it on top of it at all, for it will excuse nothing to you. 
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something from the dregs of oil on top of it: because it relieves the course of blood. 
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your bloodletting, by which phlebotomists prohibit the course of blood at veins: and they do this with tyriaca, aloes, and sagapenum when one of them is put on the place. 
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood becomes thinner and dissolves when it is thick.  
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if a large inflammation should happen in the place of bloodletting, for it often happens, especially to him who is not a phlebotomist except from that side, or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and put a sponge infused in water and salt, warmed a little, on the place: and bind it for an hour; because it will be resolved.  
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein. 
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If anything of blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm; and if you wish, put something dissolved of aloe or myrrh upon it; or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it. 
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often there occur abscesses and swellings at the phlebotomy of the basilica.  
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place your hand upon it, then if you find softness under your compression upon it, then that prominence is bad. 
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore be careful to place something from what we have said upon it.  
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps arterial blood may flow from it. 
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency so that the place hardens.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. 
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you draw from every man blood according to the amount of his strength.  
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the prevailing color over the blood. 
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it reddens; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow out until it becomes refined; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed. 
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong and needs bloodletting with one ounce, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged, and the phlebotomy be wide; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that. 
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that you draw it out in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and what is best administered in the phlebotomy of a vein is that there be a transverse section, not a puncture. 
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from the incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.  
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for whom fainting is customary during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eats before the bloodletting a small amount of bread soaked in pomegranate juice; or seneca root, if it is warmed; and you should extract from him three or four times an amount of blood. 
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he has a cold complexion, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of pomegranate juice, or in syrup of honey spiced with aromatic herbs, or in fragrantly spiced syrup. 
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	And if fainting should occur during bloodletting, and the cause of it is the excessive loss of blood; then it is necessary that he takes in a drink meat broth and refined fragrant syrup; and uses aromatics with agarwood, and lines his chest with them; and uses the other things we mentioned in the division on fainting from evacuation. 
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But whoever wishes to spare his arm, and to shed his blood on a second day; it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he sheds blood gradually by the amount of his strength on consecutive days. 
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But he who wishes to spare his arm and shed his blood on a second day, and whose body is strong; then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting. 
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite side from which it inclines; it is necessary that it be done to him on the second or third day. 
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whom, however, the blood is already much and hot, and sharpens, and causes fever to occur; it is necessary that a large amount of blood goes out from him at once, and that a great quantity be extracted from him; and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting: and so that you place your hand upon his pulse near the course of the blood, lest death occur in place of fainting.  
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Very often it happens that this occurs when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. 
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not right when you wish to loosen the arm and loosen blood secondarily, when the opening of the vein has already been closed and the exit of blood becomes difficult, to press down on it forcefully, and to bend quickly. 
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad, rather let it alone until it is bled a second time. 
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that which has become clotted from blood in the opening of the vein and place something dissolved salt on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put some tyriacal aloes or sage on it and put it under gentle compression until the blood comes out.  
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein has already become inflamed, then let it be and do not press on it until the inflammation subsides. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity compels to loosen the blood a second time and there is no excuse then either let the phlebotomist perform it above that place or in the other arm in another vein. 
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The funis of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of Fuscae and Basilicae when they are not found and are hidden because it is composed from them. 
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the weak person introduces their hand into warm water until the pulse reddens and the vein appears manifestly.  
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bound on it with a ligament with little constriction in the middle. 
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy is made across it gradually, not laterally nor according to length; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you make it on the juncture of the hand a little.  
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the exit of blood is prohibited then immerse your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve what you need. 
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the summer days, then you excuse yourself from repeating the hand in warm water. 
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed most of all the course of blood is put in warm water in the time of winter. 
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is not a pulsating vein under it, nor a nerve. 
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	But phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand brings illnesses of the liver. 
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is, that you bind the back of the hand with a ligature, or your hand, after you have immersed it in warm water, until the vein is inflated and made very apparent to the sense. 
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize it transversely. 
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you entirely miss it, it will not harm her in any way. 
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve, that you do not finish your hand with phlebotomy. 
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers laid bare from flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand to warm water, and let the blood run into it. 
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood coagulates in the orifice of the vein, and is prohibited from the course. 
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	Therefore when you draw out a necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it does not quickly consolidate. 
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary, that you do with every strict branch.  
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	But the advantage of its phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it brings illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy, just as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	But the advantage of the Saphenae phlebotomy is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the wombs, and retention of menses, and infirmities of the kidneys, and ancient ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar from illnesses. 
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of his bloodletting is that the sick man should introduce his foot into warm water and make friction upon it until the veins protrude; and he should tie above the junction of the foot with a ligature. 
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the place of the veins is near the heel, apparent towards the thumb; and many branches ramify from it on the surface of the foot. 
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore let the phlebotomist make the incision in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregation; for this is better and safer. 
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	But if the phlebotomist makes the incision on the surface of the foot, then let him beware of the nerves which are beneath it upon the surface of the foot. 
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And let your phlebotomy be such that the phlebotomist makes it transversely, as if he wished to cut it; and let the phlebotomy be Nesil.  
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is prohibited, then immerse his foot again in warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated. 
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the phlebotomist misses the vein at the first attempt, then he should repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for this place is safe and you need not fear any harm from it, when you are careful of the nerves, as we have said. 
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphena vein of the other foot equally.  
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the place of the Sciatic vein, as we have said, is near the heel on the outer side. 
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of its bloodletting is for pain in the loins when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its bloodletting is that the sick man should enter a bath and hurry; and he should constrict his leg from the side of the loins up above the heel with four fingers with a thin, long strip; for it does not appear except because of this. 
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it therefore appears, then let the phlebotomist make the incision in whatever way is possible for him, or according to a transverse direction; and it is better that either he should cut into it with an incision or divide it with a section. 
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it itself is very hidden in many people. 
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then let phlebotomy take some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the auricular: and be cautious of the nerves, and make it run out with as much blood as you wish. 
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the stricture, and put skin over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place.  
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals very quickly. 
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use. 
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter ninety-eight.  
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cups are made from horns, and from metal, and from glass. 
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.  
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.  
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification is according to two methods. 
Aut enim est cum igne.	For it is either with fire.  
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire. 
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And there are fourteen places on the body where cups which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are applied. 
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is cupping Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and cupping Alhagdahim, and they are two laminae of the neck from both sides at the same time: and cupping menti, and it is under the jawbone in the lower part of the mouth: and cupping of two spatulas: and cupping Alachosos on the top end of the coccyx: and cupping of two focilium, and they are the middle of the two forearms: and cupping of two legs: and cupping of two caulae.  
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not extract blood from you from the tiny veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore virtue does not fall away from them, as is the case with it from phlebotomy.  
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should ventilation be administered with or without fire in any illnesses which arise from repletion until the whole body is evacuated. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity compels to ventilation from illness or on account of custom we administer it at any hour in the beginning of the month, at the end of it and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be. 
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are men who when blood multiplies in them until they need its extraction through ventilation find heaviness and a headache in their head. 
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among these men are those who find repletion and redness in their face, head and neck. 
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among these men are those who find itching in their face and forehead and darkness and dullness in their eyes. 
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among these men are those who scratch the place of their ventilation. 
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among these men are those whose laughter multiplies. 
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among these men are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth or whose tongue swells and sheds blood.  
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among these men are those whose sleep multiplies. 
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among these men are those who see in their dream blood and redness and the slain and wounds and things that are similar to these. 
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore when we see anything of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order ventilation to be done after two or three hours have passed from the day. 
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of ventilation of the nape of the neck is because it brings relief to heaviness in the head and what flows down to the eyes.  
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that it be done after evacuation of the whole body. 
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed, ventilation is in place of cephalic phlebotomy.  
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted for one of cold complexion or who has catarrh to use it. 
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings great harm to him. 
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore old men should not use them, and those whose heads have cold ailments. 
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever becomes accustomed to it, forgetfulness is generated upon him. 
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore you must instruct the one who uses the cupping glass to put down his hand with the cupping glass for a short time towards the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness. 
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Cupping or Alkehel is in the place of phlebotomy for dark-complexioned people and phlebotomy for pale people, and therefore it brings relief from asthma, constriction of breath, fissure of the instrument of breathing, cough, and repletion.  
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And the cupping glass Alkehel should be applied for a short time, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.  
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	But cupping with Alhagdahim brings relief from pains happening in the head, ophthalmia, hemicrania, perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is in the place of phlebotomy for pale people. 
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you must instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarring; so that he does not strike an artery and there is a flow of blood. 
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Cupping under the chin brings relief from ulcers in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar ailments which are in the mouth; and it stands in the place of phlebotomy for alierich which are in the two lips.  
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Cupping with spoons brings relief from Alchafacham, which comes from repletion and heat. 
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Cupping of the interior parts of two focilium brings relief to phlebotomy of the three veins, pale and dark-complexioned and cephalic; because it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other veins larger than them until the attraction reaches the three veins. 
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you must instruct the one who performs cupping not to proceed too much in scarifying; because the place is stripped of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries. 
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But the cup which is cupped on the bare skin brings hemorrhoids to the anus and lower ulcers. 
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you must instruct the one who performs cupping that the cup be large and that it be of metal; because the place needs strong suction and perhaps slender cups will break; and let it be scarified with a large scarification. 
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cups on the legs diminish manifestly; because they draw blood from the whole body and bring ancient pains to the kidneys, womb, and bladder: they provoke menses, and bring about relief from dropsy and asthma: and they stand in place of two phlebotomies of the saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.  
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly and cause fainting to occur in many people. 
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And cupping of the alhorcobeni is benefit near to the benefit of cupping two legs.  
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the cups is, that you place the cup first empty and suck with temperate suction; and do not prolong the position of the cups but put them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors may come to the place with equal arrival: and do not cease to iterate and continue that until you see the place already reddening and swelling and the redness of blood appears; then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.  
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of bodies. 
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of men with tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more; so that the place is not ulcerated. 
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the one who performs cupping to enlarge the scarification and make it shallow; and to moderate the suction in ease, swiftness, and gentle motion.  
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then it must be bled twice. 
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, the first opening is made by thinning the blood and its wateriness; and in the second, by a careful extraction of thick blood. 
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then let a third bleeding be done so that the last result may follow.  
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we want to extract blood gradually or a little, one bleeding is enough for us. 
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	But if we want many extractions of blood, we make many bleedings.  
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it must be bled deeply; and the equal end in bleeding, is the depth of the skin. 
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered from oils at the placement of cupping and what should a cupper beware of?  
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	Indeed, for one whose skin is thick, hard, dark and whose pores are tight, it must be anointed with opening, softening, resolving oils; if it is in the summer season, such as oil of alkane or oil of violets or oil from sweet almonds or oil from pumpkin seeds.  
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the winter season, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or syrup oil and those similar to them.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if the excess is thick and cold then let the oil be bitter almond, or oil of balsamic, or white oil, or anise oil and those similar to them. 
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	But if the cupper is for those with open pores and tender flesh, then oil must be prohibited, and they must wash the cupping places afterwards with rose water, or cold water, or sun water, or pumpkin water, or purslane water, and similar to them.  
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much humidity should wash with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumacs, and the like. 
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But he who has thick superfluities should wash his wounds with old wine, or with samsuck water, or a decoction of anise, or chamomile, and the like. 
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that washing be done in a bath, or in the track of a bath, indeed it is necessary that it be given after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.  
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And no one should sleep after washing. 
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it by which the wind-remover, or phlebotomist should be regulated before washing?  
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is necessary for you to consider first, then if the wind-remover or phlebotomist is choleric and his blood has sharpness and inflammation, then he should take cold things, such as pomegranate juice; and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and scandibin, and iuleb, and the like.  
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And make his foods chicks, and boiled eggs, and foods seasoned with sour things; and the like. 
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And he whose complexion is cold should take syrup of honey, or of almonds, or alsecaniabin made from seeds; and take fragrant wine which is between old and new; and be directed to use a small amount of food. 
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And make his food chicks, and canaries; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and dove chicks. 
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that drink on the day of washing and phlebotomy be more than food; and it is necessary that in some people a tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, musk, or alesselithe be given in drink before washing, and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the main limbs may be strengthened, and the blood thinned.  
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it in a heated drink. 
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Winds Without Scarification. 
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But those winds which are without scarification are winds which are placed upon the liver and spleen and podagra and upon the belly, navel, and places of the kidneys, and the thick ankle; because these members do not suffer scarification upon themselves. 
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them except an attraction of blood from a member to a member; such as we place a cupping glass upon the nipples in the sickness of a discharge of blood from the nose. 
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them so as to loosen cold and invisible windiness in a member; such as we place a cupping glass upon the belly and navel. 
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it thins the member and warms it and removes the pain therefore because it has resolved that windiness. 
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys when there occurs a stoppage or a stone in them. 
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its power of attraction it perhaps opens the stoppage or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when placed upon the liver and spleen in order to ward off windiness in both. 
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with incision only. 
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire. 
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of pleurisy; and this is so that the cupping glass should be filled and be large with hot water alone or with water in which herbs have been boiled which are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	On the Form of a Cupping Glass Administered With Fire. 
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two fingerbreadths open, according to what we have formed; and let its depth be half a palm; and let there be on its side in a place which is around its middle a small hole according to the quantity by which a needle may enter it. Make it from brass or bronze, thick rims, smooth, equal, polished: so that it does not injure the member at its position upon it; and let there be in the middle of it a crosswise rod from brass or iron where a candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this is made large and airy, greater than we have described, and slightly smaller than that, according to the illnesses and age of him who uses it. 
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For cupping glasses of children and thin people are different than cupping glasses of men and fat bodies.  
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this cupping glass with fire on a limb is to light a flax wick with fire from linen, or a small candle from beeswax; and place it over the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the fire is ignited around the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.  
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the limb; and a finger should be on the hole which I mentioned, until whenever we hold the cupping glass: while we need to, we remove the finger, and vapor will exit over that hole, and the cupping glass will be released immediately.  
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the flax wick according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it. 
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But the cupping glass which is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, does not have a transverse rod, nor a hole; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this cupping glass, the larger it is, so that it takes a lot of water, is better.  
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Concerning the Suspension of Bloodletting Instruments. 
Caput XCIX.	Chapter Ninety-Nine. 
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting instruments are not administered in many, unless in those limbs in which the position of cupping glasses is not possible due to their small size, such as the lip, and gum, and those similar. 
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb stripped bare of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and those similar.  
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should come from bloodletting instruments which are in sweet waters, clean from decay.  
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be immersed day and night in fresh water until they are lean and there is nothing left in their bellies. 
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should first be evacuated with bloodletting and with enemas. 
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the limb of the sick person until it reddens. 
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them upon it. 
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are therefore full and fall off, and suction of the place is possible with an enema, then this is the best method for healing; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. 
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with plenty of water, rub it and squeeze it. 
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the flow of blood continues after the falling off of the bloodletters and it oozes, then infuse a cloth of flax into cold water and place it on top until the oozing is stopped.  
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the blood increases, then sprinkle powdered tragacanth or gallnuts and things similar to these astringents on top until the bleeding is stopped.  
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place bean halves that have been skinned on the spot and leave them until the beans adhere to the spot, for the blood will be stopped.  
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a repetition of the bloodletting is needed, to change them when possible. 
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the bloodletters are prevented from sucking, then wash the place with fresh blood.  
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or insert a needle into the place until something comes out of the blood. 
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they themselves when they sense something from the blood, will adhere immediately.  
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	Therefore when you wish for them to fall off, sprinkle something ground from aloe, or salt, or ashes on top of them and they will fall off immediately. 
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	End of the Second Part. 
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Third Part of the Surgical Book of Albucasis. 
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discussion on restoration and dislocation and the treatment of twisting and similar things.
Caput I.	Head I. 
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of accidents in bones. 
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye, O Sons, that foolish physicians and the common people boast of this chapter, who have never looked upon an ancient book, nor read a letter from it. 
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it is that this method, from the sciences, is private in our land.  
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never found anything good in it at all, and I did not obtain from it what I obtained except for the length of reading ancient books, and study upon their understanding, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them. 
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and the length of study in my life.  
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and upon what passed experiment mine, after I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it without abbreviation, and showed it without declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, with being from the addition of declination, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.   
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	A summary and collections from being bone fractures, from those whose premise is necessary before we begin the recollection of broken members, and diverse, if any. 
Caput II.	Head II.  
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter, summaries of speech and chapters, to which intellect the craftsman is compelled in the first place for station upon their truth: namely so that you, and those who are ready, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.   
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when it happens to someone a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or a fall: then it is necessary that you hurry first to let blood from him, and loosen him, or both together: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of power: or he is a child or a decrepit old man to whom it has happened: or it is a time of intense heat, or very intense cold. 
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold herbs, and poultry and kid meats; and forbid wine, and fatty meats, and to be filled from foods and all food which fills the veins with blood. 
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are safe from the hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the sick man return to his first regimen with which his custom ran. 
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Therefore when a broken bone begins to be restored, it is necessary that the sick man eat foods nourishing with much nourishment, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and things similar to these. 
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly, and better.  
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in those who are in the first old age and decrepit, it is not possible that they continue and are consolidated according to their nature always, because of the drying up of their limbs: and those which are consolidated and continued from them are at the end of their tenderness, such as the bones of young children. 
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Truly nature annexes upon a broken bone from every part something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, so that it adheres and binds itself, until they are joined together and are bound together, until it comes into the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prohibit anything from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you put nourishment of the sick man with foods in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we said.  
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that fractures are of different kinds, according to the diversity of limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all other limbs are different from each other: and I came with the recollection of every kind of fracture exposed in its own Chapter, distinguished from another. 
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of bone fractures are also diversified among themselves. 
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it happens that its fracture is arched, besides which stars occur in it. 
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture happens according to the length of the bone; and there are its fractures that are splintered, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, such as are in a reed pen, when it is fitted with a knife for writing. 
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with a wound and a disruption in the head; and there is a small fissure fracture. 
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And to each species there is an ingenuity or instrument proper to its restoration, according to as its remembrance will come, distinguished in its places.  
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which a bone fracture is recognized, it is its crookedness and its prominence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand. 
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor a sound at your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does it find great pain: then there is no fracture there; but it is possible that there is crookedness or a small fissure. Therefore it is not necessary that you move it with your hand and compression altogether, but rather lay upon it from medicines of which its remembrance will come after that moment which suits the place; and then let a fine bandage be applied. 
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place arches and splits into two, besides which splinters occur in it; nevertheless every part is removed from its companion: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to its rectification, equalizing it before an inflammatory swelling comes upon it.  
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if an inflammatory swelling should come upon it, then let it alone for several days until the swelling subsides. 
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to whatever method is possible from gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and equalization is easier than that of a bone in which splinters occur. 
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it according to how you will remember it. 
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if there are splinters in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from two parts, if it is the hand or foot; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two cords, or with a cord and hand. 
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb on an equal surface, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended; then try to return those additions with all your ingenuity, and in whatever way you can into their places; and beware, according to your strength, lest pain or injury befall the weak one during your operation; and try, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to the better forms. 
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour for you to try and touch it with your hand.  
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the amount of your strength. 
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of vehement extension and strong compression, as many stupid people do. 
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Very often they cause a hot abscess or contraction to occur in the limb through their operation, as we have already seen that often from their operations.  
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind after the setting and decent operation and constriction of that limb, and quietude and peace; and warn the weak one about it. 
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware not to move it in the hour of his vigils and sleep during his turning and stirring and at elimination, and all his movements with the last of his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he should beware so that the position of the limb is not one with which pain follows. 
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is because when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb, then it is necessary for you to change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.  
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with it, so that its position is equal and straight, so that torsion does not occur in the limb when it is restored. 
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of the fractured limb is, according to what I describe. 
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs are differentiated by their number, and their size, and their form.  
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those of them which are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the calf, and those similar to them, then it is necessary that there be an envelopment of soft, fine cloth. 
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those which are large, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be a broad, firm envelopment in them. 
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad bandage connects the large limb and constricts it from every part with equal pressure, so that no blemish enters it. 
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your evacuation from equalizing to place a suitable unguent on it, in a soft pledget over the place of its fracture. 
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to enwrap the bandage over the place of its fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the limb deserves, and constrict your hand a little with the bandage. 
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture and constrict less than the constriction which you made at the fractured place. 
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend yourself with the wrapping from the fractured place a little and soften the constriction gradually until you take a great thing from the sound place. 
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another splint and wrap it again over the fractured place with wrappings.  
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture. 
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the constriction of the wrapping and its softening, according to what we said in the first upper wrapping. 
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wrappings some soft pledget or cloth with which the torsion of the fracture may be equalized if there is torsion in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.  
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another bandage over it. 
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, immediately place even stars upon these wrappings, if there is neither swelling nor hot pus in the area. 
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or pus there: then place upon it something which will draw out that pus and remove the swelling; and leave it for several days. 
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind stars upon it at that time. 
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be made from strips of cane, wide, planed, and cleverly shaped; or they may be made from wood from which strainers are made, such as pine or boxwood, that is, palm branches, or calamus reeds; and let the width of each star be according to this form and shape.  
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star which is placed upon the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to what is fitting for the limb in size and smallness.  
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind the stars with another bandage, according to the same first binding. 
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over it with threads evenly, according to what we said about binding; and let your binding be tighter over the place of the fracture; and the further it is from the fracture, the looser the binding should be.  
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and are made from soft linen. 
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of stupid people who put their own threads made from twisted linen cords, it is a great error; because the binding falls apart with them beyond quality.  
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, fine threads are not suitable: because you do not achieve what you want through binding with them.  
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's width between star and star. 
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	And if a weak person is injured at the ends of the stars after binding in healthy places; then put under them some soft tow or carded wool until nothing is hurt by it. 
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound, and disruption occurs in the skin, I will come with remembrance of it in the second chapter singularity. 
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every fractured limb ought to be bound with splints from the first day. 
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For this is because when a limb is large, it is not necessary to put splints on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of hot inflammation. 
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored, which are put on fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Method of a common shortened plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it is temperate, neither hot nor cold. 
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is as follows: you take from the flour mill powder, which is the medulla of grain that hangs on the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstone; and you prepare it as is, except that you sieve it with egg white: and put the confection of it neither thick nor thin.  
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it. 
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Method of another plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and torsion. 
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almonds, and opium, and acacia, and enulacampane, and mugwort; and juice of all, each ten drachmas; myrrh and aloes, both five drachmas each; and alethil twenty drachmas, let them all be ground, sifted, and mixed with alethil water: or with egg white if the complexion of the sick person is hot. 
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people. 
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Method of another plaster which also benefits fractures and torsions.  
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, and mess, and white alteae, all ten drachmas each; myrrh and aloes, both five drachmas each; acacia six drachmas; armenian bole twenty drachmas; let them all be ground with much pounding, sifted, and prepared with water or egg white; and let them be administered. 
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of plaster for joints, and separated bones from their places: and it soothes the pain happening to them, and the crack of bone, and the fracture. 
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool that has been squeezed dry, and submerge it in vinegar, and boiled oil: and place it upon the location. 
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this indeed plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in the soothing of a hot abscess: and it expels pains properly. 
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of plaster which restores a broken bone. 
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of the deaf fig, and leaves of the wild poppy: and grind all, and make a plaster from both. 
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of shortened plaster, administered at the restoration of a bone fracture: and when you wish the resolution of a remaining abscess. 
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take root of althea, and chamomile, and flowers of violets, and flour of herb, all of one part: grind all, and make them with wine, if the member is not heated. 
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if it is heated, then make it with water of humid coriander, or with water, and use it.  
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Method of another stronger plaster in the resolution, than this first, when there occurs a hard abscess at the restoration of a limb.  
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take root of althea, and flaxseed, and balaustium, and melilot, and samsuck, and flower of violets, and chamomile, all of one part, grind all, and make them with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine. 
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that according to the heat of the limb, and the rest of its heat.  
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	However, Hippocrates did not say in his book, that one should place upon a fractured limb at its restoration, except a plaster made from wax, and oil: nothing else: and he related, that it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.  
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen thought that for the restoration of a broken limb things should be placed upon it in which there is dryness of heat, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense, and things similar to them from those which we have mentioned. 
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of a Plaster Which Brings Together the Injury and Pain.  
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort and chickpeas and hairs of a man cut short or a bird's feather, and altea and salt in equal parts; grind them, and sift them, and make a plaster from it. 
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity however according to which it ought to remain so that the ligature is then loosened is this, that you consider at that time whether there does not occur a weak pain nor itching nor is the fractured bone moved from its place; then do not loosen it for many days. 
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if a vehement itching occurs to it in its place, or an unsettling pain, or swelling; then hasten and loosen it within the hour, and remove the plaster from it; and take soft linen or a soft sea sponge, damp: and submerge it in lukewarm water and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain ceases. 
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.  
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place wool cut up soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil upon it; and bind for one night until you are secure from a warm abscess and the swelling of the limb subsides and its pain is removed.  
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it to a subtle tightening and a small plaster; and do not bind it tight with your first binding and a subtle one with it until it is healed. 
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	But if you see that the abscess and redness and pain and swelling and all accidents have now been entirely removed and the plaster and binding are no longer needed; then repeat it as you did at first equally. 
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	But if nothing of those things which we have said happens to the limb, then do not loosen it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven.  
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when that which is sent away for twenty days has completely adhered according to what appears to you from the resolution of the limb, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of the flesh approaches it: add then also in the strapping more than your first whole strapping; and add also in the thickening of food for the weak, according to the preceding remembrance thereof. 
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out and wasting more than it should: then know that nourishment is prohibited from reaching it. 
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore embrocate it with warm water at every time you loosen it, and let it be so for three days, and relieve the strapping a little.  
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation nourishment runs to the limb and heals quickly. 
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which foolish restorers do from a fractured limb with another vice, when it is not restored at first according to what is right, and it is restored according to crookedness, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have said it in their books, and they would have operated with it.  
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any trace of them anywhere at all in that matter, and it is better that it should not be done. 
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the making of an accidental injury to the head. 
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The kinds of fractures are diverse and their figures are many: and the causes thereof are distinct. 
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is that which happens from a blow with a sword: and the blow takes away the whole bone until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and on account of that this species of fracture is called Axial. 
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a sword strikes a certain bone and strikes its face and the incision does not penetrate to the very end thereof: and this species of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Elevation entirely. 
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small. 
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from fracture is that which is a crushing, or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or things similar to these. 
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the panniculus, which is under the bone; or it is on the face of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large. 
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from fracture is that which is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and on account of this this species of fracture is called Capillary. 
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture which occurs from a fall, or a blow of a stone, and things similar to these, which cause the lamina of the bone to enter inwards, and a cavity is made in its place; just as it happens with caldrons of air, when a blow strikes them, and a part of them enters inwards.  
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And very often indeed this happens in the heads of soft bones, such as are the heads of children. 
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these species of fractures are separated by sutures, and I will come with a remembrance of the whole of it in its place. 
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these species of fracture by probing upon it, and inquiry into them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh which are upon them. 
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species Capillary, however, is recognized by this, that it is probed upon the bone, and cleaned away, and polished upon it with a cerate; for the fracture appears black. 
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the sick person; then if you see from the accidents that it signifies with manifest indication fear, such as vomiting cholera, and extension, and loss of intellect, and stoppage of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and egress of eyes, and redness of them, and things similar to these accidents in many dispositions, without a doubt it will not be healed; and if you see accidents which are not terrifying to you, and you hope for salvation: then begin its treatment.  
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What it is, if he comes to you wounded at first when he is wounded: and that is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you strive in the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all arrangement. 
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the fatty tissue is corrupted, and those accidents which we have related occur. 
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	And if the fracture of the bone has already reached the fatty tissue touching the brain, and it is with small particles, and attraction: then it is necessary that you cut into the crushed and rubbed part, according to what I tell you. 
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded man: and expose above the bone according to whatever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light upon the sick person. 
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	And if it should happen to you at the exposure of the bone a flow of blood, or a hot abscess: then oppose it with that which is necessary. 
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you fill the place with cloths dipped in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the abscess settles, and you are safe from the flow of blood. 
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the healing of the bone, and its removal. 
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.  
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method indeed is to cut into the bone with an incised strict blade: and this is its form. 
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another incisor after the incisor somewhat wider: and this is its form.  
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply also another incisor even wider than the second. 
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have at hand a number of diverse incisors: some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others: and they are sharp at their last extremities, and are made of steel, or iron: and use ease in percussion above the incisor so that it does not shake the head and injure it. 
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to perforate it around its circumference before you apply the cutting instrument, with awls which are called non-penetrating awls; they are not so named unless because they do not pass through the thickness of the bony substance to that which is beyond it. For this reason the awl has a rounded end above that which is below its sharp point, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents submergence and passage through the thickness of the bone. 
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take a large number of these awls, each of which suits the thickness of the bone, until you have an awl present for every skull: whose sharp end in length and shortness should be according to the quantity of the thickness of that skull.  
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of awls, or trepans. 
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of perforating around the broken bone is: to place the awl upon the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated. 
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the awl to another place and put what is between every hole a quantity of the thickness of the radius, or approximately that. 
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with cutting instruments what is between every hole from the bone; and make it more subtle than you are able above that which is at its end, as we said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand or with some other instruments which you have prepared for this: such as tenaculum forceps and fine pincers. 
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you be cautious with all care lest the awl or cutting instrument touch anything of the meninges. 
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have gone around the bone perforating and it has been separated from the meninges if it was continuous with them and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you shave and smooth the extremity of it which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to a cutting instrument. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thin and more delicate than other cutting instruments. 
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	And if anything remains of the small bones and splinters, then take them with ease using what instruments you have. 
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterwards with linens and ointments as we have said.  
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of surgery is easy, altogether far from fear, which Galen said and praised it with great praise; and this is his word. 
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin by exposing the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and apparent; until when you have exposed that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular cutting instrument, which has this form. 
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, being smooth, does not cut anything; and its sharp part on both sides thereof extending in length, as you see; so that the lenticular part be applied to the bone, with its face incident acutely on the bone.  
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the cutting instrument from one side with a small mallet until you cut through the whole bone easily, as it revolves; and you be secure from the pannicle, that what you fear does not happen to it altogether.  
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more stupid than men, and ignorant of it, nor were he sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, he would cut it away from it with the extremity of his lenticular cutting instrument, and free it with ease.  
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear. 
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the panniculus, and what is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and subtle splinters remain in it; then it is necessary that you shave away that roughness, and eradicate those splinters with subtle rasps from which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it be possible for you to administer from them in every suitable place more convenient ones, and straighter ones, according to that which the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its figure.  
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your reasoning, which first roots out the mouth, wider than those razors. 
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a more subtle one. 
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you arrive at administering a thinner and more subtle one of them all. 
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	But in every one of the remaining small fissures and subtle fractures, it is necessary that you administer care according to that which leads to its correction. 
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that is not concealed from anyone who has any study whatever in this art, and has stood upon that which we have written and shown in large fractures.  
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the panniculus that is laid bare is retained when you root out the mouth: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth according to the quantity of the wound and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the orifice of the wound.  
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled or tripled and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do that as easily as you can over it so that it does not weigh down the siphac.  
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer a wide ligature over it: and do not tighten it except by the quantity which holds the wound only: and leave it with this care for one day or two days until you are secure from hot abscess.  
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it and administer afterward medicines with which there is superfluous dryness such as lily roots, herb flour, frankincense powder, aristolochia and similar to them: and it is necessary that you make a powder from these medicines, which is powdered over the wound as they are dry. 
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer in it every medicine of a property which is to cleanse and not bite.  
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your virtue that the wound be clear in your healing: and there be neither filth of ointment nor dirtiness in it.  
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Do not allow pus to collect on it at all: for when pus gathers upon the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and there follows upon the sick man thereafter a great ill. And this has already occurred in the skull, when the opening is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness arises on its surface. 
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if accidents happen to the sick man which we have said, know that it is undoubtedly pernicious. 
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine which is put upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and lines with them a cloth. 
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the skull: afterwards care for it with kinds of treatments which suit, until it is healed.  
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken. 
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except its two upper parts together, or one of them: forasmuch as it itself has two bones: because the lower part of it is cartilaginous, it is not broken and there does not happen to it except attrition, crookedness, and bruising.  
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you introduce a small finger into the nostril and equalize that fracture with your index finger, and thumb outside until the nose returns to its natural shape: and let this be done artfully, with ease.  
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And be careful that during your operation, that pain does not befall the sick man. 
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger does not reach it: then it is necessary that it be equalized by the extremity of a radius, in which there is a small thickness. 
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the fracture is in both parts, then do the same as that: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.  
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, apply a warm poultice at rest. 
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the extremity of the nose a linen wick if the fracture is in one part; or introduce two wicks if the fracture is in two parts; and let it be of such thickness as to fill the nostril. 
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers have said that the wicks should be steeped in butter and changed every day.  
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	But that does not seem right to me; rather, the wick should be steeped in egg white mixed with powdered starch. 
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the wick until the mouth is set and the cartilage hardens.  
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is introduced into the nose in place of the wick after it has been wrapped in a soft cloth; and this holds the nasal fracture more firmly and so that the weak person is not prevented from breathing.  
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary. 
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, use wicks.  
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it should happen that the nose breaks again while you are working on a hot poultice, plaster the nose with carrot or with quince infused in rose oil, or a little from dragon's blood. 
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if there is no hot poultice, then it is necessary that the plasters be made with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white.  
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft swab on top of it and do not bind the nose in any way at all. 
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces or crushed, then it is necessary that you split them apart and remove them with instruments suitable for the purpose. 
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the incision and care for it with plasters or ointments suitable for that purpose until it heals and unites. 
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound should occur between the nose, then it is necessary that you heal it with ointments and apply a tube of lead until it heals. 
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.  
Caput V.	Chapter Five. 
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not with a wound, then observe if its fracture is only outward, and it is not broken into two, and curves inward: then its recognition is easy. 
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore it is necessary that if its fracture is on the right side, that you insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the infirm: similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and press with it the gibbosity of the fracture inward with ease to the exterior with your other hand from the inner part of the bone decently, and equalize it with it. 
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	But if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you apply extension from both parts, according to straightness: until its equalization is possible. 
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if there should already occur a concussion or disruption in the teeth: then bind those from which you hope that they will remain with gold thread, or silver, or silk. 
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a cerecloth over the fractured jaw.  
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and put a large well-made starched bandage over the cloth: or a piece of leather equal to the length of the jaw. 
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it from above according to how its binding is prepared for you and suits its application until it is not destroyed, and order the infirm person to be in tranquility and quiet; and have their food be mild draughts. 
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that something is already changing in some way: then hurry and untie it on the third day. 
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten what has been altered from it and plaster it with powder of millstones, with lime water, or with sesame flour after you have removed the cerecloth; and put soft wool over the plaster. 
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	Therefore while that plaster remains applied over it and the bone's position is not changed, leave it alone until it heals or bind the fracture. 
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often bound in three weeks. 
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if a hot abscess should occur meanwhile, then administer that which we have often said in its treatment until that abscess is removed. 
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it. 
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if now a fragment is separated from the bone or from the sinews, then take great care in this so that you remove those fragments of sinews with what is fitting for you from instruments in their removal. 
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the wound opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a phlebotomy according to the amount of your need. 
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those sinews and nothing remains of them, suture the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, apply over it one of the plasters which are suitable for that, and let it become incorporated until it heals.  
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the Furcula when it is fractured. 
Caput VI.	Chapter VI. 
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Furcula is most often fractured from the front part from the shoulder and its fracture occurs according to one of three ways. 
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it is either fractured and separated into two, besides which sinews occur in it; and this is easier for its restoration.  
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so that sinews occur in the bone; and this is more difficult for its restoration. 
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so that it is a fracture with a wound. 
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it when the fracture is without a wound is that you have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the following fractured Furcula and the other extends the neck towards the side.  
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form is made as it should be and there be neither prominence nor concavity in it.  
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If the extension is not sufficient, it is necessary to place a sphere made of cloth or wool under the fork of the fractured limb; and its size should be according to the amount needed: extend and raise the fork and constrict the sphere with your hand until you equalize the fracture as required. 
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the extremity of the fork outwards because it has reached a depth, then it is necessary for the patient to be laid on his back and for a medium-sized cushion to be placed under his shoulder, and for an assistant to press his shoulder down until the mouth of the fork which is in the depth is raised upwards; and then straighten the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.  
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	But if you feel a splinter from the fork and it moves, then you must split it above that and extract the splinter easily. 
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	But if it is held fast in the bone, then apply ingenuity in its incision with one of the incisors which you have prepared for that purpose after placing under the fork an instrument which retains the splinters; and this instrument is made of wood or iron. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon which has no concavity.  
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to that which you need from the magnitude of the bone and its parity. 
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length however should also be as much as possible for you for the operation.  
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two extremities, as you see: one extremity is broad and the other narrow. 
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if the disruption of the wound which you have made when extracting the bone splinter is wide and you are apprehensive of a hot abscess, then join the two lips of the wound together with sutures. 
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small or you fear a hot abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and lint according to the amount of the wound's fissure.  
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess should occur, then pour a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and put it on top of it. 
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	But when a bone stricture is without wound and without incision, apply an embrocation made from mill flour with egg white on the bone. 
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft pledget on top of it. 
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its nipple, if that is needed. 
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himemat, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long, and let its width be a palm or thereabouts. 
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled cushion on top of the pledget and embrocation. 
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length. 
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth. 
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the himemat which falls upon the fracture and place. 
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the himemat upon the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it upon its neck, and under its healthy nipple, and under its unhealthy nipple: and reduce it over every part, and as you see that the stricture holds the fracture strictly; and this is that which is not hidden from you, and all so that the splint is not removed from on top of the fractured bone.  
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this it is necessary that you look at the weak [person] every day. 
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligament is softened, and you see the splint already moving: then straighten that, and tighten the ligament. 
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the weak person's sleep upon his back, and put under his nipple at his sleep a small cushion at night, so that it may be raised with him as aid from his side. 
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the clavicle is therefore elevated by elevation of the shoulder.  
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not untie the bandage unless itching or an abscess should occur in the place, up to twelve days. 
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it. 
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction and let him go until it is restored and coagulates.  
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed a fracture of the clavicle is bound and strengthened for the most part within twenty-eight days: and sometimes it occurs in some men in a lesser time. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a scapula fracture.  
Caput VII.	Chapter VII. 
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The scapula is rarely fractured, and in its wide part: and the margins of it are not broken except from it.  
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore when a place is broken from it and broken in its middle and it is not known except by touch; then according to what the fracture's shape is, try its preparation.  
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape in every way possible for your ingenuity. 
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the place miller's dust with egg white and a soft swab, and put a poultice of doubled cloth on top. 
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place upon it a wide splint from a thin board according to the quantity of the whole scapula, or a little wider. 
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if there is a concavity under the splint in any part of the scapula, then equalize it with a soft swab until the splint descends according to equality.  
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it on top with a long bandage, with decent constriction and firmness of the splint until it is not removed from its place.  
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day. 
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage softens, tighten it and equalize the splint if it is removed from its place; and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And a spatula is indeed restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days. 
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then untie the ligature: and you will be in safety. 
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their solution. 
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if a fragment proceeds from a bone, and pricks under the skin: then split above it, and remove it. 
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the clavicle from the repose of a hot poultice, if anything should happen from it. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Breastbone.  
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone is sometimes fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. 
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed are most often broken, and are shattered from its accidents.  
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is fractured, which inclines downward, and it suffers violent pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps vomits blood, and a concavity is shown in the broken bone, and is not hidden from the senses, Its restoration is, that the weak person lies on their back; and place pulvinar between its spatulas. 
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press its shoulders, and join the ribs from both sides or flanks with hands: and gently bring it into equality, according to every way possible and suitable, until the shape of the bone returns, according to what is necessary.  
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place plaster and a wad on top of it, and put an splint from a thin board of willow, or elder, and those similar in lightness on top, after you have wrapped it in cloth. 
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage according to its roundness to the back several times, and tighten it with a decent constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage every hour, and whenever it becomes loose, tighten it: and if its necessity provokes its loosening at itching, or corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or an abscess: then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and correct what happened with the method of its treatment.  
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then apply a plaster if you see that the face requires it, and bind a bandage to it until it is healed. 
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.  
Caput IX.	Chapter IX. 
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in thick places which follow the back, and from their extremities on the front side. 
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And attrition does not happen to them unless it is because they are cartilaginous.  
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from feeling by inquiry with the fingers. 
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that you equalize the fracture with your fingers as much as possible, until the shape is equalized according to what is necessary. 
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters and bind the broken bone with splints if it needs it.  
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inwards, then there occurs a severe pain and stabbing, like that stabbing which occurs to one who has pleurisy; therefore because the bone stabs the membrane, and also difficulty in breathing occurs to him, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is a difficult cure.  
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have already devised many ingenuities in this matter; and among them are those who say that you should give the sick person foods which produce inflammation and windiness so that the belly becomes inflamed and expands and the fracture is pushed outwards.  
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, detest doing this so as not to cause a quick formation of a hot abscess if it does not occur. 
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it already occurs, then you add to it.  
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: place something windy on top, and then suck it with force, and this is a similar reasoning.  
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windy superfluities draw to the place because of the weakened condition. 
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been soaked in warm oil, and poultices be placed between the ribs until it is filled; so that there is an equal binding when you encircle it according to its roundness. 
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the weak patient should be treated for pleurisy with diet and medicine. 
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the illness constricts the patient severely, in a way they cannot tolerate, and their mouth is pierced by the inflamed membrane with a painful sting, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary to cut above the place and expose the fractured rib. 
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place an instrument that preserves the sifac upon it, the memory of which has preceded: and we cut the mouth with ease and cut it itself. 
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we should bring together the two lips of the wound if it is large with suture: and we should treat it with plasters until it heals. 
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If it should happen that a hot abscess occurs then quickly infuse poultices in rose oil and place them upon it: and the patient should be treated with what is suitable for an abscess.  
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile he should also lie on his side upon which he sleeps until he heals. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fractured vertebra of the back and neck. 
Caput X.	Chapter Ten. 
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	A fracture of the bones of the neck sometimes occurs and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back.  
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore it happens to someone and you wish to know whether it will heal or not: then consider. 
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see their hands already softened and stunned and dead; and they cannot move them nor extend them nor constrict them; and when you constrict them with your fingers and prick them with a sharp point, they do not feel it, nor do they feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal and is mortal in many dispositions. 
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if they move them and feel constriction with the fingers and pricking: then know that the nape of the bone is sound and that the patient will be healed with treatment. 
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if it should happen to the vertebrae of the back similarly to that and you wish to know whether it will heal or not then consider their feet: then if you see that they have become softened and what happens in the hands occurs in them; and when he lies on his back, flatulence and excretion exits without volition; and when turned over onto his stomach, excretion exits without volition: and when turned over again onto his back and wishes to urinate and cannot: then know that it is mortal. 
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not labor in its cure. 
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing happens to him from it, the matter is lighter. 
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of what happens from it is to try calming of a hot abscess so that you place on a tampon ground rose oil alone or with boiled yolks.  
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that on it several times a day until when the hot abscess is calmed; then place on the spot one of the comforting and drying plasters and bind it with a bandage; and order the sick person to use quiet and tranquility.  
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the side where he finds pain until he is healed. 
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	But if it happens at the rubbing of a broken bone or something that is already separated from it; then it is necessary that you cut above the skin and take it out. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound if it is large with suture.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some flesh-colored unguent until it heals. 
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the last bone of the humerus is broken and it is the end of the tail then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus and equalize the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and in a second equalization. 
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something on it and take it off; and care for the wound with the care that preceded until it is healed. 
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of a shoulder blade.  
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of the shoulder blades broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	But if they are broken then their fracture is not except for a fragmentation at their ends and they split lengthwise and lean towards the inside and it happens to the sick person pain in the place and stinging and the limb that is broken becomes numb. 
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it indeed is to extend your hand upon it until you stand above the fracture as its form is. 
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from equation, until it is assimilated to its natural shape. 
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or already leans inward: then make the sick person lie on their stomach until restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. 
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have equalized it, put a plaster on top of it; then put an splint made of wood or leather on top of it; and bind a bandage over it so that you do not fear displacement of the fracture nor removal of the splint. 
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of those with what fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality; and order the sick person to sleep on their back or on their sound side. 
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot abscess should happen to him: then cease from its extension and its restoration until the hot abscess subsides; and put on top of it what subsided on it, according to what preceded, then return to its restoration and bind it as is necessary. 
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if a bone should lodge or be crushed, extract it.  
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the Adjuvant. 
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Adjuvant is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Spatula. 
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows. 
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bandages are tied at its two ends. 
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from an elevated place; and the sick person sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let them project their fractured arm onto the wood until it reaches its nipple, in the middle of which the curvature of the wood is attached.  
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy from above it so that the attendant stretches it downwards. 
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician shall equalize the fracture with his hands at the same time, until the fracture returns as it should be.  
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is for the sick person to be laid on his back; and suspend his hand from his neck with a ligament. 
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two attendants, so that one of them holds that which is above the fracture with his hands; and that the other holds below it, and each extends towards his own side.  
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish there to be a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with a ligament, and above it with another ligament; and let each of the two attendants extend them towards their two sides. 
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed under the armpit and another under the fracture towards the elbow. 
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow; then it is necessary that a ligament be placed above that place and above the elbow itself.  
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease and without labor until when it is equalized as it should be and a good dressing is applied; then bind it if a hot abscess does not occur.  
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the binding until the seventh day. 
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it wool dipped in vinegar and rose oil until when the abscess subsides; then bind it; and the method of binding it is to put a plaster over the fracture. 
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an envelopment from new cloth over the plaster. 
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let him bind his arm upon the support and put his hand open upon his shoulder.  
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place cloth and bind it above the support upon the arm so that the arm remains in the place of the stars; if nothing prevents you from it nor anything changes upon it from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something might change over you from a broken bone, then use splints; and it is, that you place upon the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints. 
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every splint the width of a finger; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side. 
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind above the splints a binding which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. 
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your binding be tighter over the place of the fracture. 
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture lengthens, the looser the binding should be.  
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	Therefore if you see the position of the splints and the binding, as we said, in the hour that you restore the limb immediately do so; and if you fear a hot inflammation, then loosen the binding and the splints until the seventh day, as we said. 
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage every three days so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place, nor is food prevented from reaching the limb because of the abundance and tightness of the bandage. 
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct the whole thing according to what we said.  
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bandage except after three days or more. 
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the sick person sleep on his back, and his hands upon his stomach; and put under him a full bolster equally padded with wool. 
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb not be loosened, or that the bandage be softened. 
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct all this with your skill.  
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the sick person food according to the order which we have previously prescribed, so that it be delicate food at first until his mouth begins to tighten; then it is necessary that you increase his food.  
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of the helper and the leg is that it tightens within forty days; then therefore it is necessary that it be loosened and a bath be given and treated with ointments that correct it. 
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul and comminuted, then do not remove the ligature and splints from it for up to fifty days, and up to two months. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fractured arm. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter Thirteen. 
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two humeri. 
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small and it is that which follows the thumb.  
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	The other is large and it is that which is placed under the smaller one from its lower part. 
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Therefore perhaps only the larger humerus is broken, or perhaps the smaller one; and perhaps they are broken together.  
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller upper humerus is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier. 
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower humerus is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.  
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when the two bones are broken together. 
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone which is broken is the smaller upper humerus, then it is fitting for the physician at its restoration to place a small extension with ease until it itself equals.  
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the larger humerus is that which is broken: then it is necessary that he place a stronger strapping very forcefully. 
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he place the shape of the hand at its restoration, and its extended extension upon a cushion. 
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers, and let the lower joint be below all the fingers, or the rest; and let a weak seated square be upon itself, and let the cushion be before it, or in its direction, at a height so that the weak person does not incur labor.  
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from its lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage. 
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And let another attendant extend it similarly from above. 
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then let the physician equalize the mouth, until he reduces it according to as good a form as he is able. 
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	But if there are splinters in the bone fracture, then endeavor to reduce every fragment into its place by your power. 
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if a separated splinter appears in it, and pricks the skin, and you have no hope in its restoration: then cut above it, and remove it according to the way we said in those things which were set forth before. 
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I already made for that a separate chapter, therefore take its treatment from there. 
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	But if a hot abscess should happen at the beginning of your restoration, then make a cloth with cerate made from rose oil, and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and subtlety; and bind the cloth over it with a subtle binding until when the abscess is subsided: then remove the cerate, and put on a plaster prepared from powder of millpond snails with egg white. 
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on splints, and let the splint that is put over the fracture itself be a little wider, and stronger.  
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one focus, or in two focuses together. 
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put your binding over the place of the fracture stronger and more vigorous, and somewhat more with binding toward the superiors of the fracture, or toward its inferiors: or put a softer binding than its binding a little, according to as the previous recollection of it was in the beginning of the chapter. 
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wound over the fracture be soft cloths, damp: and let them not be hard, rough. 
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread by which it is bound be flax properly, medium between fine and thick as we have related.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the bandage after days. 
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	And if anything should happen of which correction is needed, such as itching that happens to the limb: then it is necessary, that you embrocate the limb with warm water until that itch subsides, and let the limb go unconstrained until it subsides, then repeat the binding. 
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture has already been softened and the mouth already removed, and similar things: then correct all of that with your own skill and consider it again. 
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excess stricture, then it is necessary that you soften it a little and let it be for several days until nourishment flows to it, then constrict it. 
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of the things we have said happen to the weak one, then it is not necessary that it be loosened except after twenty days, or thereabouts. 
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then suspend the weak one's hand to its neck. 
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its neck be level, and let it be guarded by its own strength from agitated movements. 
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back. 
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. 
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of that is according to the dispositions of complexions, and the dispositions of strength.  
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the Restoration of Fractures of the Hand. 
Caput XIIII.	Chapter Fourteen.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the chest of the hand and of the knuckles rarely occur.  
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to it except through much attrition. 
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore when a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs: it is necessary that the weak one sits square: and in front of him let there be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand extended upon it. 
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant extend the broken bones, and let the physician equalize them until they are joined in a good conjunction. 
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he place a plaster and bandage, if hot swelling does not occur. 
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint on top according to the quantity of the area: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is about the lower part of the sole near the belly, then make a ball shape from cloth and tell the patient to press it on top of it with his broken foot; then tie it tight with a long strip of cloth. 
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let there be a star made from leather, in which there is softness so that the leather may be applied with the body of the foot; and bind it as needed. 
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary: to put a star on top and another star from below onto the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. 
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a binding, as the hand turns, and extend it between the fingers with a bandage. 
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	And if a fracture happens to any of the nodes of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be equalized as needed.  
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with the sole; and if you wish, put a small straight star on it so that the fracture is raised and does not move. 
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, or ring finger, then it should be equalized and tied with the healthy finger that follows it; or they should all be tied according to their sequence, and this is better. 
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a small star on top of it, as we said for the thumb. 
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration and after the placement of a warm poultice; and oppose it with what is necessary when something happens from it, according to how its account proceeds.  
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Hip. 
Caput XV.	Chapter Fifteen. 
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured, and it is revealed to the senses because it turns towards the inner and rear part. 
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in this way: a bandage is tied above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And let the patient lie face down. 
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let the minister extend all the ligament to its part according to equality; and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone. 
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if there is a fracture near the root of the hip, then let the ligament be to the part of the pectineus, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament under the fracture. 
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.  
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then let the physician equalize the bone with both of his hands until he reduces it according to the likeness of the natural figure; and let the bone be conjoined by a good conjunction.  
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you put on a plaster and strapping, if an abscess does not occur in the limb. 
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then let it alone for several days until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your healing. 
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	And its strapping thus shall be.  
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you envelop over the fracture a hard linen cloth, that is, a bandage; and double it twice, or thrice; and let there remain an excess from it. 
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then envelop the leg until the heel reaches at the root of the buttock.  
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee downwards; and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.  
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then revolve over the leg and hip what remains excess from the linen cloth. 
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the hip in the place of the fracture itself splints; and place from them one splint over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the voids between the leg and hip with soft cloths so that the strapping is equal. 
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with strong strapping from the middle upwards to the place of the fracture with three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend with the ligament from the place of the fracture, let your strapping be smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the thigh and the leg. 
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore tie with both three knots which are above. 
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with the two ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the heel of the foot. 
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both constrict also the extremities of the knots from the other side, so that the ligature is not removed from its place.  
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the constriction upon it while it remains so that neither corrosion nor an abscess nor swelling nor anything similar to them may occur to the limb.  
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	But if anything of this sort should happen. 
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then hasten with its solution and rectify everything that happens from it altogether, according to what we have said many times.  
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if there is a piece of bone in the bone that is sharp, then it must be made even if it is possible for you to do so. 
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, cut upon it and remove it; and attend to it as we have previously mentioned until it heals.  
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And whenever this fracture of the thigh is constricted besides the addition of knots to it as we have said in regard to the arm and forearm. 
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration thus fractured, a weak limp does not occur.  
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone besides which the other leg is applied, then it is necessary that he who owns it should always limp.  
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the thigh is constricted for fifty days or a little more or less; all of this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a fracture of the patella.  
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the patella rarely occurs, but attrition happens to it very often. 
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if a fracture should happen to it, then it is not unless a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound. 
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it is placed entirely upon that with sensation. 
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that it equals what has been broken off from its parts with fingers, until it is gathered together and joined according to what is possible from equality and ease, and making. 
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster of sesame flour, or miller's flour, with egg white; and place a round star on top of it if that is needed; and bind over it a suitable bandage for that. 
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements which we have narrated in the other fractures: such as a hot poultice, and things similar to it; so that you oppose every accident with what suits it until it is healed. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a leg fracture. 
Caput XVII.	Chapter Seventeen. 
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called the Tibia; and the other thin, and is called the Fibula.  
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of these kinds of fractures as it does to the two bones of the arm; and because of this its restoration is done like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one. 
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If the two bones are broken together, the leg turns in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg turns to the front part. 
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it lower down; and it is among those that are not hidden from you. 
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension and setting, and binding of stars according to that equally. 
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However it is necessary, if the leg fracture is a foul one, having many splinters; that there be less extension and gentler alleviation by you. 
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something more from the operation than in the arm; and it is that when you set the stars and complete all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood which are used in making sun-dials to be put under tables; and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which have a small thickness and are not thin ones; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.  
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each one in a cloth with two wrappings according to its length. 
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg from one side and the other from the other side; and they shall be from the knee down to below the foot. 
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two bandages in three places from the two extremities and the middle. 
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when constriction is forbidden, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands in a good position. 
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a crib be administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it so that it preserves it from movement. 
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed it is very necessary that you make that in a fracture when it is with a wound properly. 
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day and strive with the utmost care from abscesses or swelling or other things.  
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of those things should happen, then oppose it with what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills.  
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes. 
Caput XVIII.	Chapter Eighteen. 
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture indeed does not occur thoroughly in the heel bone.  
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	But a fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the foot and rarely also in the toes; and it does not occur to them except by attrition in many positions.  
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	And if a fracture should occur in the bones of the foot and you see those bones elevated above each other, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground as if walking.  
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones; then press or step on it and equalize it until it returns to its place. 
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster and a wad on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the foot with a decent bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things it needs. 
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	Therefore, when three or four days have passed, then dissolve the ligature. 
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equalized, whether they are fractured or dislocated.  
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation on them is therefore as you see. 
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some fingers are broken, then restore them and equalize them according to what I have told you about the restoration of the fingers of the hand. 
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint with your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider; then place this board under the foot which I have told you about, and bind it with a decent binding. 
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its own size over each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board under the foot; and let it stand on one head of the board outside the belly of the foot so that it holds with good retention. 
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you not to forget that you consider all that I have told you in the remaining fractures from the accidents we mentioned, and oppose everything with what is necessary.  
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the breastbone, and a man's rib. 
Caput XIX.	Chapter Nineteen.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit square.  
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly to the back of herself, and let it be held back. 
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton, until she fills it; and let it be made in the vulva like a sphere from it. 
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.  
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For the cotton comes out, until it is made like a sphere before the vulva gate, and the broken bone returns. 
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a poultice on her back.  
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore when he wishes to urinate, let him remove the bandage easily and then urinate; and let him reintroduce it in the same way that you first inserted it; then let him return to his original position. 
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let him do this for seven days or so, for the mouth itself is being restored. 
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a bladder of a sheep and fasten a reed tube upon its opening, and introduce the whole bladder into his vulva. 
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within his vulva for the fracture will reunite.  
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with lint and let it remain for several days, as we have related, until it is healed. 
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the breastbone of a man or woman is fractured, then apply in its restoration and to its reunion that which we have related in the case of the shoulder blade bone. 
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And do not conceal the rectum in these neighboring fractures which occur rarely, especially for one who has some skill or practice.  
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine well, for the fracture itself indicates to you in many situations the right way in its restoration and its reunion; therefore understand it.  
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the penis of a man is fractured, take the gullet of a goose and insert the penis into it. 
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place an application of cloth upon it and let it be wrapped up, and let it remain for three days or so; and it will be healed if God wills.  
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of fractures of bones when there is a wound. 
Caput XX.	Chapter 20. 
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for one to whom a fracture occurs with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or the femur or similar to those, that you hasten and phlebotomize him immediately; if the conditions of phlebotomy are attested to you as we have previously stated. 
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If a wound bleeds, then it is necessary that you hurry to cut it off so that powdered charcoal be sprinkled upon it: if you do not have anything else present. 
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day and do not postpone it unless an abscess occurs. 
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then delay its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. 
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth day at all, for you would cause bad things to happen to it. 
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin exposed: then it is necessary that you try to reduce it and equalize it with your hands with little effort and extension. 
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if its extension and equalization are not prepared by your hands then reduce it with this instrument.  
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers or eight and its width is according to the quantity of the wound. 
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four of them according to the quantity needed for its healing in every kind of fracture. 
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round and have a small thickness so that it is not doubled upon compression on it during the hour of the operation and let its extremity be sharp with an edge at its ends.  
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let the upper part of it extend in thickness from its middle to its bottom. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the sharp curved extremity of it be placed upon the extremity of the prominent bone and press it with it together until the bone returns and equalizes with some equalization. 
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to equalize the extremities of the fracture to each other.  
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if the extremity of its fracture is slender and does not receive good acceptance from the instrument then it is necessary that you cut into the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.  
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them entirely with what we have said, then cut it with one of the knives which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you. 
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape away what remains in the bone from roughness and fine scales. 
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	Therefore, when the bone is reduced and it finds vehement, painful aching after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place. 
Fac ergo illud.	Do it therefore. 
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer a great benefit on the infirm when you complete your restoration which you make to the bone.  
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in black astringent wine. 
Et proprie si est in aestate.	Especially if it is summer. 
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place anything on the wound which contains wax or oil; so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption in it. 
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer splints in the hour following your restoration of the bone.  
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound exposed: so that you may cut a hole with forceps in the folds according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution not to constrict the wound with a fracture. 
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Very often foolish doctors have done this and caused death, corruption or suppuration, that is, discharge, to befall their patients.  
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, different from the constriction of other fractures. 
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	And if the wound is bad or large and you fear some of the evils which we have mentioned may befall it and you find pain suspended in the place then it is not necessary to apply splints over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make folds from hard cloths instead of splints and constrict it with them.  
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when after a day or two, you see the wound already beginning to form pus in it; then remove from on top of it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply linen cloths and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the Tetrapharmacum ointment and those similar to it. 
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it behooves you to loosen the ligature. 
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed. 
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so that pus flows from it to the lower parts with ease.  
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass and the wound does not consolidate nor is pus separated from it, then know that there are small bone fragments there. 
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to inquire about the wound with touch.  
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	However many of those fragments are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separated and prick the limb and cause pain to occur, try to cut into them and remove them in any way possible for you.  
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if a wound should happen to develop phlegmon, or erysipelas, that is, eschar, or some other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to oppose to each of these with what suits it from its treatment, of which we have previously spoken in its own chapter. 
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in the case in which my speech must stand, and to which you should direct your mind when a bone is broken and protrudes above the limb, such as the hip bone, the femur, and those similar to them from large limbs, it is that you do not presume to draw it out, for very often death results from it; rather, leave it alone until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall away by itself after twenty days or thirty.  
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, therefore, care for the wound if it seems right to you; and if not, leave it alone. 
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of a Swelling at the Site of a Fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI. 
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	It often happens that thisNodding occurs in the course of healing a fracture.  
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the joints; and it spoils the shape of the limb from it. 
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural operation. 
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider then, if the nodding is recent: apply to it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and those similar to them. 
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you may take some of these, or all of them; and mix them with astringent wine, or with the white of an egg, or with vinegar; and put them upon the nodding in a pledget, and bind them over it with a good constriction.  
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the constriction, and do not loosen it for many days. 
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and repeat another, until the nodding is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a sheet of lead upon it crosswise. 
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodding has already turned into stone, and is tight, and urgent necessity quickly arises to remove it: then make an incision upon its upper part, and cut away the excess that projects; or shave it with certain razors until it is removed; and treat it until it heals.  
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when restored, and the limb remains afterwards slender, not according to its nature. 
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII. 
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of a bone is restored, and the limb remains afterwards slender, weak; then it does not happen except for many causes. 
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is, the multitude of loosening of the ligature and its ligation not according as it ought; or on account of an excess of constriction of the ligaments, until nourishment be prevented from flowing to the limb; or on account of a multitude of superfluous embrocation in an unseasonable hour; or on account of a scarcity of blood in the body of the sick person, and its weakness. 
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its treatment is to feed it weak and soft food, until the blood multiplies within it. 
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath. 
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness over it. 
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it. 
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And continue its embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and it returns to its natural shape. 
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored twisted. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.  
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that after the restoration and healing of a limb, there is a twisting and prominence of the broken bone, or knotting, and the shape of the limb is spoiled, yet nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural operation, then you must not heed the one who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed very blameworthy, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be mortal. 
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and knotting are recent, then it is necessary that it be embrocated with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as leaves of marshmallow, and its root, and melilot, and those similar to them.  
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for it with a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of marshmallow root and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil and plaster it with that. 
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs and grind them with dove dung and those similar to them which are called in medicine reducing consolidation.  
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened with diligent, ancient, and gentle friction which is done with wet hands. 
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let motion be given to the limb in all directions every hour. 
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if crookedness has already preceded and become strong and been converted into stone and necessity for its treatment with iron has arisen, then it is necessary that it be cut above it and the continuity of the bone be loosened and what overflows from the knot or bone be incised with fine incisors; and facility be given to it with care and attention. 
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning speech in dislocation. 
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV. 
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of any joint from its place. 
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its motion and the figure of the limb is spoiled.  
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains and vehement injuries to befall the weak one. 
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore when dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration and not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and perhaps reduction of the dislocation with it. 
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary that it be moved or extended in the hour of its inflammation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For very often it causes spasms and harmful pains to happen.  
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then you ought to hasten to the phlebotomy of the weak one. 
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let him be dismissed until the inflammation subsides. 
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be embrocated with warm water and oil. 
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And let all the limb be treated along with it whose remembrance will come into its place. 
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I myself have already arranged the chapters of dislocation, even according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw. 
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Rarely do the two jaws dislocate except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And dislocation of both occurs according to one of two methods. 
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are removed from their places by a small removal and softened for a short time.  
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation until they are softened to the chest, until the saliva of the sick person flows and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech. 
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, its dislocation is small, then it returns in several positions by itself with little effort.  
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if it is a complete, total dislocation, then it must be administered reduction quickly and not delayed at all: and the attendant should hold the head of the sick person: and the physician should insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the jaw of the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is from one side.  
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert both of his thumbs together, if the dislocation is from two sides. 
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And let the remaining fingers of his hands be outside, with which he equalizes.  
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the sick person to cleanse his jaws and release them for eating on all sides. 
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician equalizes the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.  
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer vaporization with warm water and oil until an easy reduction of both is made: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we said. 
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When, therefore, they return and are equalized, and the mouth of the sick person is closed, and they are not softened: then place poultices of cloths on them, with cerate made from wax and rose oil. 
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is tied with ease with soft bandages.  
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sick person's sleep be on his back and his head stand between two pillows so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor should he attempt or be forced to chew anything: rather, let his food be a gentle sip until when the pains are removed and the jaw is bound: then let him eat what he wants, and administer it with ease. 
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not labor over an operation upon his own mouth at eating and drinking and kissing until the mandible is joined and healed. 
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the reduction of the two mandibles becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places; then often fevers and constant thirst arise from this; and perhaps the bowels of the sick man are loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.  
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore when you see this, know that it is destruction and often he to whom this happens dies in ten days. 
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of a dislocation of the collarbone and extremity of the shoulder. 
Caput XXVI.	Chapter Twenty-Six.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from the inner side because of its continuity with the chest. 
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates to the outer side and that is made clear by sensation.  
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is such that the sick man lies on his back and extends his arms. 
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then with your palm constrict the place with strong constriction for it will return itself.  
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put plaster on it and lint and bind it tight. 
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	But the extremities which follow the elbow and are continuous with it do not dislocate except rarely.  
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it should dislocate on some day then it must be reduced and equalized according to what we said and that which is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put plaster on it and lint and a bandage.  
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And advise the sick man to adhere to quiet and rest until he is healed. 
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the extremity of the shoulder is reduced when it too is separated from its place.  
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus. 
Caput XXVII.	Chapter Twenty-Seven.  
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus does not dislocate except according to three ways.  
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is to dislocate it towards the side of the fibula below. 
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is to dislocate it toward the side of the chest. 
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it may be dislocated to the upper part of the humerus, and that happens rarely.  
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate backwards, because of the spatula. 
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate forwards, because of the nerves. 
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it most often dislocates and comes out below towards the fibula, especially in those whose flesh is scant.  
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it comes out quickly in them and goes back in quickly. 
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is plentiful, it is the opposite of that, namely because it comes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty. 
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people that a blow or a fall occurs, and the humerus becomes inflamed with hot inflammation, and it is thought because of that, that it has already been dislocated. 
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you ought to try that until you stand upon certainty of it, and then proceed in its treatment. 
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is recognized when it is below towards the fibula and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a sound humerus.  
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a manifest difference between them and you find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the fibula at the touch the head of the humerus as if it were an egg itself, and he who is infirm cannot return his hand to his ear nor move it with all motions.  
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards then you find a manifest touch and it is not concealed. 
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent or the infirm one is a boy.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is for the attendant to raise his hand upward. 
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your thumbs under his finger, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place; and let the assistant raise his hand and extend it upwards. 
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it below, for he returns quickly. 
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return through what we said and there have been many days from the beginning since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the weak person bathe in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water and administered.  
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then let the weak person be laid on his back; and let a sphere and wool be put under his finger, which is equal between softness and tightness. 
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the physician put his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the weak person's shoulder with force, and pull the hand of the weak person downwards. 
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And let another assistant hold the head of the weak person so that it does not move downwards; for he will return immediately. 
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method; and it is that you make a man who is taller than the weak person be present, and he stands on the side, and inserts his shoulder under the finger of the weak person: and raises the finger upwards until the weak person is suspended in the air. 
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And let another assistant pull the hand of the weak person downwards to his belly.  
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the weak person is light, then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else so that it weighs him down; for the dislocation returns immediately. 
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method; and it is that a long piece of wood be fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape: such as a mortar handle: which is neither thick nor thin. 
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be put under the weak person after soft cloths are placed on top of the head of the wood; and let the weak person stand according to the length of the wood. 
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be extended downwards on one side and his body extended on the other side with force; for the joint returns to its place quickly. 
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this care: and it is that you take wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers; let it have a round head so that its entry into the depth of the joint is eased, according to this form. 
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be tied over the round head so that the wood does not injure the weak limb.  
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place it under the weak joint so that the hand or arm is extended upon the wood up to the lower parts; and bind the wood above the support, the arm and the extremity of the hand. 
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm upon a step of a ladder by its width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the remaining body hang suspended from the other side. 
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately. 
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Therefore when its entry is complete according to whichever way is possible: then it is necessary that you put under the joint a sphere of equal size from wool.  
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a plaster prepared from miller's powder with frankincense and white of egg over the whole shoulder, just as it turns over. 
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the joint with a decent bandage; and let the bandage be wound over the plaster from above; and attach his hand to his own neck and let it go, and do not move his hand for seven days. 
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the weak one until the limb is strengthened; for this is quicker for its healing.  
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a wider bandage should be placed after seven days or five, and he should be raised with movement. 
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is made firm and not softened, then it is now healed. 
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the junction is dislocated many times, because of moisture which happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be applied to it, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery. 
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if this whole thing is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the junction is not confirmed, and the plaster and constriction are applied upon it several times, and it is not made firm, and it falls and cannot be raised to the upper parts: then you will know that its nerves which are at the head of the shoulder have now been cut, or stretched, or softened: and you will know that the junction will never be fixed in its place. 
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation which occurs towards the chest and nipple, or to the back reduction, is made with a push and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining constriction and care are administered to it, until it is healed.  
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	But if it should happen after healing that heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its motion, then let the weak person use a bath many times, until that heaviness is eased and it returns to its former nature.  
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the elbow. 
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter Twenty-Eight. 
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and indeed it dislocates to all sides, and especially to the front, or to the back. 
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls under sight, and under touch, according to whichever shape it may be dislocated.  
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the sound one, it is declared to you manifestly. 
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed, and the arm cannot bend, nor touch its own shoulder with it. 
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to him. 
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess should occur to him, its reduction becomes difficult and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back. 
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations and more vehement pain to them and very often death descends with it. 
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is from those which are possible to reduce is that his hand be extended with two hands and that his arm be extended, and the hands of the physician be above the elbow and beneath it, and he himself presses the joint with the thumbs of his hands together or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place. 
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or truly the dislocation is to the front: then it returns so that he doubles his hand with his own hand until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated. 
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	But if the dislocation does not yield to reduction then administer strong, vehement extension and it is that two assistants extend the arm and that two others hold it firm so that it is not moved during the extension.  
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then revolve the arm to every part after it has been wrapped with a long doubled cloth or a broad bandage over his hand. 
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand let him anoint it with oil so that it may be one of those things which assist in lubricating the joint with ease.  
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he presses the joint with a vehement thrust until it returns. 
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it in which there is astringency and drying with egg white and let it be bound with a decent bandage.  
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the sick person and dismiss him for several days. 
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be loosened.  
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	But if the joint is made firm in its place then untie the bandage from it and dismiss it. 
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the junction not well joined, then repeat the plaster, and the bandage, and leave it for several days, until it is joined. 
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then dissolve it. 
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if gravity happens to it after the reduction of the junction, and the disposition is in motion: then administer moisture in a bath, and subtle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place over the junction iliac fat, that is, the nape of a ram. 
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is tied, and leave it upon it day and night. 
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into a bath. 
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then rub the junction with tempered friction.  
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over it alizata juice once, and twice, and thrice with the entrance of the bath, until it is softened. 
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over it cow dung, moist, heated with butter, and bind above it. 
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.  
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is softened, and returns to its disposition. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of a dislocation by Al-Zahrawi.  
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Almassem's hand dislocates very often, that is, the junction which is between the arm and the hand.  
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of his dislocation is easy. 
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to other junctions. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However it is necessary that swiftness be in the reduction of his dislocation in the hour in which it dislocates, before the place swells: or a hot abscess occurs in it.  
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in him is that you place Almassem's hand weak upon a table and let an attendant extend his hand: and let the doctor place his palm upon the eminence of the junction, and push it until it returns. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that consideration be given, if the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then let the weak person place the back of their hand upon the table at extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let the position of their hand be intrinsically upon the table, that is, the inner part of their hand be placed upon the table so that the hand of the physician may fall upon the eminence of the joint.  
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess, and dismiss him, and do not touch it again. 
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not bear, and you are unable to achieve reduction upon it, after days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains according to its crookedness; and it does not harm the weak person anything except that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are cut or rubbed. 
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no recourse in it except that it be bound with a cautery near its fall.  
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not contribute anything. 
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then put upon it the plaster which we have described.  
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound and dismissed for five days; afterwards let it be loosened and dismissed, and let the hand be exercised.  
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its motion is deprived and some weight occurs in it: then soften it with warm water and repeated friction until it is softened. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.  
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX. 
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from them to any part, or a finger from them to the back of the palm, or its belly; then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns. 
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it toward the part to which it is dislocated, and dismiss it for two days. 
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend him, and extend it, until the straight one is equal in its day. 
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	Therefore, when it is night, bind it according to the very account; and do not cease to loosen it during the day; and exercise it with motion; and bind it at night. 
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days, until it is tightened. 
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do likewise with it if it dislocates towards the belly of the hand; and bind it to the same side, and perform your first operation on it until it is healed. 
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it dislocates to the other parts. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the vertebra of the back.  
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-One. 
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are moved from their places; then there is no cure for it, because death hastens for the weak one. 
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the excretion of the weak one goes forth without volition, and he cannot hold it; and very often some limbs are softened from it, or two legs, or two arms of his, or one of them; or one vertebra is moved from its place.  
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Very often, indeed, it is moved, because very often the removal of them happens to four parts. 
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is therefore moved backwards is called Kyphosis. 
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it, however, is that you consider then if the Kyphosis happens from childhood; then there is no cure for it, nor is there healing at all from it.  
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that which happens from a fall, or a strike, or similar things to those, the ancients have already said modes of treatment in lengthy speech.  
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which most does not return with profit. 
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have already shortened it from that, which excuses a little from much of it because of my proximity to intention; and by my exposition in which I exposed it, and shaped its instrument in a different way from that which they showed and exposed it.  
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore I say that in a hump which occurs from the front part, there is neither skill nor cure from it. 
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which happens on both sides also. 
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them except that which occurs on the back properly, with what I describe; and it is, that he extend infirm above his face above an equal platform near the wall; and let straw matting be spread underneath him so that his chest is not injured. 
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of wood be placed fixed in a hole in the ground, at the extremity of the platform, around his head; and another piece of wood around his feet at the other extremity of the platform; and let an attendant hold the wood, and let it not be fixed in a hole. 
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let another attendant hold the other one.  
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then let a soft, firm bandage be wrapped over the head of the infirm person, and under his shoulders; and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is by his head; and tie it there. 
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another bandage above his hips, and above his knees, and at his ankles. 
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then bring together all the bandages, and tie them to the other wood which is by his feet. 
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let all the attendants extend their side to the wood bandage; and let the two pieces of wood not be removed from their places where they are fixed; but nevertheless, let them not be fixed, as we said.  
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician put his palms on the spine with strength, until it returns; or let him put them on a board over it. 
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet on a board until it returns.  
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.  
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And dig a hole in the wall of which we said that it is near the infirm person, a place into which the end of the board may enter. 
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on top of the spine. 
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor put his feet on the other extremity. 
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him tighten it well until the spine is constricted and returns to its place. 
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a tourniquet which is wound with your hand; and it is, that you fix in the ground at the head of the sick man on the last step two pieces of wood, whose length is one arm's length; and at his head on the last step two pieces of wood. 
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between all the wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place in which the tourniquet runs; and let all the wood be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. 
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert a round piece of wood; and it is a tourniquet in which the ligature revolves in two holes of two pieces of wood. 
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity there is a hole in which the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with that which revolves; and similarly in the two other pieces of wood. 
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligatures which you have tightened on the chest of the sick man with the tourniquet which is at his head; and the ligatures which you have tightened on his legs with the tourniquet which is at his feet. 
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let an assistant stand by every tourniquet, who twists his hand with licorice, with which the tourniquet revolves; and the doctor adjusts the spine according to what we have said. 
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tourniquet, which follows.  
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine returns and the place is leveled, it is necessary that you put a drying plaster with white of egg on it. 
Deinde stuppam.	Then a swab.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place on top of the plaster a splint from a board, whose width is three fingers or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is a quantity that takes the place of the Gibbosity and above the healthy part of the Spine. 
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the ligament which we have said. 
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the weak person should use subtle nourishment until they are healed. 
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	And if something of a prominence remains in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe are administered, with the application of the board which we have described for a long time. 
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a sheet of lead is applied to that area.  
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes it happens that a prominence occurs in the last vertebra of the back and dislocation is thought to be through it, and that is the bone which has already protruded. 
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary for an assumption to be made about this with this medicine: for it may perchance cause death.  
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of a dislocated Ancha. 
Caput XXXII.	Chapter Thirty-Two. 
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that a dislocation does not occur in the Ancha joint and the shoulder joint except for a dislocation: nor does what happens to the other joints from a small removal and concavity happen to them. 
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the Ancha joint is dislocated according to four parts.  
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is because it dislocates anteriorly and posteriorly. 
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it most often dislocates medially: and rarely dislocates anteriorly and posteriorly.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation medially is: because when you join the leg of the healthy patient with the unhealthy one, it is longer; and their knee is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and they cannot bend their foot at their groin; and the place following the groin is swollen with a warm poultice, therefore, because the head of the femur has already reached there. 
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of the one who has a dislocation laterally is that they are the opposite accidents to these accidents.  
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him to whom dislocation has happened to the front is that he extends the sound leg according to complement; however, he does not duplicate it without pain which is in the knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot pass beyond that to the front; and his urine is retained, and his groin becomes abscessed, and at walking there is a pressing of his foot upon his heel. 
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him to whom dislocation has happened to the back is that he does not extend his knee, nor can he double it before he doubles his groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and his groin is softened, and the head of the thigh bone is at the place of the ilium. 
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction truly of these kinds of dislocations is that you consider then, if the dislocation is old, which already grows old with him having it. 
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction and it remains according to its own arrangement, then there is no cure at all in it. 
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not fitting that a complete presumption be made upon him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in him whose dislocation is recent and is from one of the four kinds of dislocations then hurry to this so that you wish to join it and extend it inwards and outwards and move it right and left, perhaps indeed it returns and does not need other care. 
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong attendant and he extends his leg from the lower part, either with his hands or with a bandage which is tied above his knee: and another attendant extends his hand from above so that he inserts his hands under his tibias. 
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then let him bind with a soft bandage above the root of the thigh and hold the extremity of the other bandage.  
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension of his be either from the front part of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the back to the part of the back. 
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of them all be with one force, until the weak person is raised from the ground with his body, and remains hanging. 
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds. 
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	Therefore if the dislocation returns with what we said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every kind that which I say about its proper cure. 
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction indeed of it when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the weak person be laid on his sound side. 
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let him place a bandage over the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh and the place which is under the groin.  
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the groin to a higher part of the body, to the collarbone. 
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another assistant take hold of his strong arms and reduce the thick place of the weak thigh, and extend it outward with a forceful extension. 
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its place.  
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the other kinds of cures by which this limb is reduced. 
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it escapes from you, and does not obey you to enter with this kind of cure altogether: then it is necessary that two feet of the weak person be tied together with a strong, soft bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees; and let the length of each be four finger-breadths from its companion; and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two finger-breadths.  
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the weak person be suspended over the head of a beam which is in the house; and let the length of it from the ground be the quantity of two arm-spans. 
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then direct a strong young man to brace the head of the thigh; and let another young man be suspended with the weak person; and let another young man push, bracing the thigh with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly. 
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its reduction, however, when there is dislocation outwards, it is necessary that the patient lie on a bench, as we have described for one who has a hump. 
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the ligature be tightened above his thigh, properly the weak one, and above his chest. 
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head. 
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let a further piece of wood be placed in the middle of the bench, fixed well: on which wet cloths should be wrapped so as not to hurt the patient: and let the wood be between his thighs so that it is not pulled downwards during extension. 
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let every assistant extend to their part, and the doctor equalize the reduction with his hand. 
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to reversion, it will be good.  
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it upon the very board and press it equally as we said for a hump. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However it is necessary that the patient lie on his sound side. 
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weak leg be extended quickly: and this is according to the same account on the bench: and let the doctor place the palm of his right hand upon the groin of the weak one.  
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should compress him with his other hand and with that compression place him extended downwards towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear: then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, and he should be raised above the ground: rather he should be placed upon a hard object, as it is necessary, as it also happens when his ankle dislocates outwards, according to what we said about his reclining position on two supports: and this is upon his face and with extended ligatures: as we said recently.  
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint travels, when reduction is completed as it should be.  
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you; and it is, that you extend the two legs of the weak one; and when you see them equal, and the weak one draws up his leg, and expands it without excuse: then you will know that the limb has now returned, according to what is necessary: then join the two hips, and put on a plaster, and bind with an imemati, that is, a wheel; so that the ancha does not move to any part: and let the weak one adhere to quiet for three days, or four. 
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then untie the ligature and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation has now been fixed; therefore discharge the weak one to walking.  
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything of softening; then return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first binding; and let it also remain for three days. 
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then untie it and make him delay walking on both for several days until it is well strengthened.  
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning dislocation of the knee. 
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three. 
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee dislocates according to three modes.  
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It dislocates outward, inward, and downward, that is, backward. 
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate forward. 
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the weak one to apply his leg to his thigh. 
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere to the thigh: then you know that the knee is dislocated. 
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is to make the weak one sit upright so that he now extends his leg if he can over it, and leans his back against your face; and place his foot between your feet. 
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and pass them straight between your fingers over his knee.  
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your hand the two sides of his knee with strength. 
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant should extend his foot until the knee returns to its place. 
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease, not laboriously. 
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.  
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a splint for three or four days. 
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie them. 
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the weak one not walk for several days until he is healed. 
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with bandages, of which the preceding account was given in the treatment of a sprain, until it returns. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of dislocation of the heel.  
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV. 
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel is sometimes moved by a small removal and sometimes dislocated according to its complement.  
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs, either inward or outward. 
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding to the side to which it is dislocated.  
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the treatment of its removal is easy reduction: and it is that it be extended with ease with the hands, and equalized until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	When treating it and it is dislocated according to its complement, you must make the weak person sit straight; and let a strong servant hold him firmly from behind at the middle of his back. 
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you take his foot with your right hand from its upper part and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot in the place of the heel. 
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand. 
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then push twice with your left hand.  
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left and press the chest of the foot with your right towards the leg without effort. 
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice as we have described. 
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the chest of the foot towards the leg in the third turn and you draw the heel.  
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	Therefore if it returns in one or two turns according to this method and you see the foot equalized, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation upon him for it will return. 
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if its reduction is prevented from you with what we have described: then make the weak person lie on his back on the ground and fix a bolster firmly in the ground so that it falls between his thighs; and now wrap a cloth over him so as not to injure the weak person. 
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let a servant take hold of his thigh; afterwards let another servant extend the foot either with his hands or with a bandage which he ties above the ankle.  
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the servants extend against the extension of their companions and let the bolster stand between the two thighs of the weak person holding him so that his body is not drawn downward during extension.  
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with his hands and let another servant hold the sound leg downwards. 
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed. 
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore when the dislocation returns and its restoration of health is declared to you then apply a plaster and compress it firmly with bandages and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage. 
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you must be careful or afraid of the nerves which are above the heel behind, so that a bandage is not tight over them and injure them. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three. 
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	And if the bandage is loosened, tighten it; then untie it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the weak person from walking for forty days.  
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he tries to walk before that time, there is no safety lest the dislocation be undone over him and be corrupted and not receive healing afterward.  
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	But if a hot abscess should happen to him: then it is necessary that you administer to him in the quieting of it that which our narration previously set forth in another place from its treatment, and an application, until it is removed.  
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes, and its treatment. 
Caput XXXV.	Chapter Thirty-Five. 
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated be made equal to those with a little extension without labor; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.  
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the weak person make his foot sit upon an equal place to the ground, or upon a board; and he stands thus as if walking. 
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand and put your foot upon that which protrudes from those joints. 
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press that with your foot with strength, until it returns and you see it already equal, and there does not appear a prominence in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the belly of his foot a board which takes the whole foot, to which are two heads. 
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it with a decent bandage for three days. 
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then untie it and make him rest from walking for many days until it is tightened and secured from reduction.  
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning the kinds of dislocations with a wound or fracture. 
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six. 
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this kind occurs and you attempt its treatment and restoration, very often death follows; and therefore it is not necessary that one presume over the treatment of such a thing unless he is prudent in the art of long practice, merciful, pious, slow, neither bold nor presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning medicines which only subdue hot inflammations: and dismiss the sick to divine judgment. 
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for salvation from destruction with the mildness of the illness and where something of hope appears. 
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot inflammation occurs.  
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen which subdues inflammations; and care for the wound with what suits it from drying ointments. 
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	But if the dislocation is with a fracture and separate splinters occur in the bone, then attempt their removal and do in it what we said in simple illnesses from that which preceded in the places of them.  
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be cautious according to your virtue and guard yourself from entering the way of fear according to what my previous preaching was to you. 
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator and more lasting for your glory and safer for your body among them in your time.
