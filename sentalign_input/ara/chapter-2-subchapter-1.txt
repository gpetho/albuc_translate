Chapter One.
On the treatment of hydrocephalus in children.
This ailment often occurs in children at birth if the midwife squeezes the child's head without gentleness. It may also occur from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone but children, and all those I have seen have quickly died, so I have seen fit to abandon operating on it.  I have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day.
Until the boy could not sit up on his own due to the size of his head, and the fluid increased until he perished.
This fluid either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects under the bone, on the dura mater. The procedure, if the fluid is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that you should make a single transverse incision in the middle of the head. The length of the incision should be about two finger-widths, so that the fluid drains. This is the image of the scalpel.
If the fluid is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions, in this manner:
And if the fluid is under the bone—and the sign of that is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water recedes when you press it with your hand—and that is not hidden from you—then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this manner:
And after the incision, all the fluid comes out, then you tighten the incisions with bandages and compresses, then you anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, then you loosen the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments, and do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and you nourish the ill one with all dry foods of little moisture.
Until the organ strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling appears and where the water has collected, because it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
So direct the incision where the swelling and the fullness of the water appears to you, then incise it as you are able, and be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, so that the patient does not die from that bleeding, along with the discharge of fluid.
