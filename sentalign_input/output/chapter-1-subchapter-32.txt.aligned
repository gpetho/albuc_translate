of the swelling of the feet When the feet are swollen in a dropsical person, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning. Do not go too deep, so the citrine water can flow out, and let the cautery be in this shape:	On cauterization of the legs and feet. When, in the sufferer from dropsy, these swell and become full of yellowish fluid, you should cauterize the upper surface of the feet in the depression between the little and fourth toes; hold your hand upright with the cautery; do not let it slant. Then remove your hand and do no more cauterization whatever; for the yellowish fluid will exude.	0.84658235
Then make two cauteries on each leg with the point of the knife-shaped cautery; let the cautery be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg; and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so the water can flow out; afterward treat with the other treatments we mentioned.	Then sear the legs with two cauterizations on each leg; cauterize with the bladed end of the cautery, and let it be along the length of the leg: one under the knee, the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and two more cauterizations over each femur. Leave the burns open without treatment for a long while during which the fluid will exude from them. Then dress with all that we have described.	0.8947535
