And if the hailstone descends inside the ear towards the upper part, then turn the eyelid and stretch the hailstone with pincers, and cut and press it from one side to another; and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not harm anything; and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salted water, and treat the area with substances that generate flesh until the patient is healed.	If the stone is rather toward the inner aspect of the eyelid, then invert the lid and catch up the stone with a hook—you will not need to incise the lid—and cut it all round. If the lid is pierced in the cutting, it will do no harm at all. Then, after cutting away the stone, wash the eye with salt water; then treat with cicatrizing medicines till healed.	0.7891501
