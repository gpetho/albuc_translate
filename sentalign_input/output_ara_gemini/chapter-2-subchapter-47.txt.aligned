So whoever dislikes this, it is appropriate to make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner from line B to line C. Then, remove all the fat. Then, fill the wound with the healing medication. Then, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals.	If this is abhorrent, a semicircular incision should be made on the breast, like this figure, from b to g. Then dissect away all the fatty tissue and pack the wound with a cicatrizing compound and sew the lips together and dress until healed.	0.76663506
Then, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast droops downwards and becomes loose due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides, resembling a crescent shape, with each one joining the other at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, in this way:	But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.	0.77244675
If you are unable to completely cut what you should cut due to the patient's restlessness or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it eats away what remains of the fat, then treat it until it heals.	But if you cannot make the incision as full and perfect as it ought to have been, because the patient is restless, or because haemorrhage arises, you should pack the wound with cotton wool soaked in corrosive ointment and leave till it eats away the remainder of the fat; then dress until healed.	0.876194
