to pierce the anus/rectum
Many children are born without a perforated anus, but rather it is closed by a thin membrane: so the midwife must pierce this membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and take care that the umbilical cord is not touched; then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you fear that it will close again, place a lead tube in the opening, and leave it for several days, and remove it when the child needs to go to the toilet/latrine.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or abscess; so it is necessary to cut this adhesion: and it should be treated, as we have said, with the lead tube.
