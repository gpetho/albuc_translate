The author of this book said: When I completed for you, my son, this book, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the limit in its clarity and explanation, I decided to complete it for you with this treatise, which is the practical part, because practical work and its practitioners are completely nonexistent in our country and in our time, so that its knowledge almost disappeared and its impact vanished.
Only minor traces of it remained in the books of the predecessors, which have been distorted by hands and affected by errors and confusion, so that its meanings became obscure and its benefit distant, so I decided to revive it and compose this treatise in the way of explanation, clarification, and brevity, and to provide images of cautery irons and other surgical instruments, as this is an addition to the explanation and among the most important things needed.
The reason why there is no skilled practitioner in our time is that the study of medicine is long, and its student should be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy described by Galen, until he understands the benefits of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections, separations, knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and exits, and the pulsating and static veins, and the locations of their exits.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that doctors are many in name but few in practice, especially in surgery.
We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book, because whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned of anatomy will inevitably fall into an error that kills people with it, as I have seen many of those who imagined themselves knowledgeable in this science and claimed it without knowledge or skill.
This is because I saw an ignorant doctor who incised a scrofulous swelling in a woman's neck, so he pierced some of the arteries of the neck, and the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another doctor who proceeded to extract a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the bladder, and the stone was large, so he rushed and extracted it with a piece of the bladder, so the man died after about three days.
I was called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient what I estimated about it.
And I saw another doctor who was earning a living with some of the leaders of our country through medicine, and a black boy who had a fracture in his leg near the heel with a wound happened to be with him, so the doctor hastened in his ignorance and tightly bandaged the fracture over the wound with pads and splints, and he did not leave any breathing space for the wound, then he left him to his desires, then he left him for days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death, so I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage, so he felt relief and recovered from his pains, except that the infection had already taken hold in the limb, and I could not stop it, so the infection continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another doctor who cauterized a cancerous tumor, so it ulcerated after days until his affliction worsened, and this is because if cancer is purely of melancholic humor, then it should not be exposed to iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can be completely amputated.
Therefore, my son, you should know that surgery is divided into two parts: a safe procedure and a procedure that is harmful in most cases. I have warned in every place that comes from this book about the procedure that has risks and dangers, so you should beware of it and reject it so that the ignorant does not find a way to speak and criticize. Take for yourselves firmness and precaution, and for your patients, gentleness and certainty, and use the best way that leads to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to diagnose, and purify yourselves from what you fear will bring you suspicion in your religion and your world, for it is more lasting for your prestige and higher in this world and the hereafter for your status.
Galen said in some of his advice: Do not treat a bad disease, so you are called bad doctors.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, organized and arranged from head to toe, with images of instruments, cautery irons, and everything needed for surgery.
The second chapter is about incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, removing arrows, and so on, all organized and arranged with images of instruments.
The third chapter is about bone setting, dislocations, treatment of tendons, and so on, organized and arranged from head to toe with images of instruments.
