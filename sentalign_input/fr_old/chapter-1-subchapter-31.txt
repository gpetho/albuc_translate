of dropsy (edema)
Cautery is not effective for dropsy except in the manner called "ascites". When you treat it according to the methods we mentioned in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two on the back over the spine, and one on the chest; and let the cauteries be close to the thickness of the core.
Afterward, leave the cautery open to expel pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will come together with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the clavile that we showed earlier; and the one for the back should be olive-shaped, as mentioned earlier.
