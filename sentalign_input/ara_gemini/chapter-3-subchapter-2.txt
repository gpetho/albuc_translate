The second chapter on the fracture occurring in the head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms are various, and their causes are diverse.
Some fractures result from a sword blow, and it may either completely shave the bone until it reaches the membrane beneath it, like an adze does to wood, and therefore this type of fracture is called adze-like (qadumi).
Or, the sword may cut part of the bone and shave only its surface without penetrating through it completely, and this type of fracture is called a simple extraction (qala).
The wound of these two types of fractures may be either large or small.
Some fractures are comminuted or crushed, caused by a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone or something similar.
This fracture is either penetrating, having almost reached the membrane under the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone.
The wound of these two types of fractures is also either large or small.
Some fractures are hidden in the bone with the thinness of a hair, which is a slight fissure, and therefore this type of fracture is called hairline (sha'ri).
Among them is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow from a stone or something similar, which causes the surface of the bone to depress inward, creating a concavity, similar to what happens to a copper pot when struck, causing a part of it to depress inwards.
This most often occurs in heads with soft bones, like the heads of children.
All of these types of fractures may have loose or non-loose fragments.
We will discuss the treatment of all of this in its proper place.
We identify all of these types of fractures by examining them, probing them with probes, and removing the dead flesh from them.
As for the hairline type, it is identified by exposing the bone, wiping it, and smearing it with ink; the fracture will appear black.
As for the treatment of fractures, first look at the patient's symptoms. If you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and other similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient nor treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you, and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.
That is, if the injured person comes to you immediately after being injured, and it is during the winter, you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case.
If it is during the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes infected, leading to the symptoms we described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and it is accompanied by comminution and crushing, then you should cut the comminuted and crushed part as I will describe to you.
That is, shave the injured patient's head and expose the bone in any way possible, depending on the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient.
If you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling when exposing the bone, address it as necessary.
That is, pack the area with rags soaked in syrup and rose oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops.
Then proceed to excise and remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
The first way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed instrument, and this is its image:
Then you use another piece after this piece, slightly wider, and this is its picture:
Then you also use another chisel, wider than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a set of different chisels, some of which are wider than others and some of which are shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp at their edges.
And let them be made of Indian iron or good steel.
And use gentleness in striking the chisel, lest you shake the head and harm it.
If the bone is strong and hard, then it is appropriate that you drill around it before using the chisels with the drills they called non-sinking drills.
And they called them non-sinking drills because they do not go beyond the limit of the skull bone to what is behind it, because the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a collar or small circle, that prevents it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate for you to take from these drills a large number, each one of which is suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp tip is of a length and shortness appropriate to the thickness of that skull.
And this is a picture of three types of drills: large, medium, and small:
As for the method of drilling around the broken bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Then you move the drill to another place and make the distance between each hole the thickness of the probe or similar.
Then you cut with the cutters between each two holes and do that with the utmost gentleness you can, as we said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with something else from some of the instruments that were prepared for that, such as forceps and delicate hooks.
And you should be very careful that the drill or the cutter does not touch any of the periosteum.
So if you hollow out the bone and it is cleared of the periosteum, if it was attached to it, and you take it out, then you should scrape and smooth the roughness of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be thinner and smoother than the rest of the cutters.
If anything remains of the small bones and fragments, then take them gently with the instruments you have, then treat the wound after that with bandages and ointments which will be mentioned.
As for the other aspect of the procedure, it is an easy aspect, far from danger, mentioned by Galen and praised highly, and this is his saying:
You should first start by exposing the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and obvious, so that when you have exposed that part, you place under it the tip of this lenticular cutter, and this is its picture:
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part of it on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the peritoneum and the face of the sharp section is on the bone.
Then you strike the section from one side with a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, no frightening accident will happen at all, even if the therapist is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is sleepy.
If something attached to the bone from the membrane remains in some places of the bone, then scrape it off with the edge of the lenticular section itself and gently remove it from it, for it will be removed without harm or fear.
But if the bone fracture did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was cut from the bone was its surface, and roughness and fine fragments remained in it, then it is necessary to strip that roughness and remove those fragments with fine scrapers, of which several different sizes have been made, so that you can use them in every place that is most suitable and most appropriate, depending on what the work and the broken bone itself and its shape lead you to.
And you should use in your stripping first for the bone the widest of those scrapers, then use after it a finer one, and you continue to do that successively until you get to using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the rest of the small capillary cracks and the fine fracture, it is necessary to use a treatment for each one according to what leads to its healing, and it is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest training in this craft and has come across what we have written and explained in major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth and dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do that as lightly as you can so that you do not weigh down the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage over it and do not tighten it except as much as it holds the wound only.
And you leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling, then you dissolve it and use after that the medicines that have excess dryness, such as orris roots, cress flour, frankincense powder, and zedoary, and the like, which is to make a powder from these medicines and sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry, and in general, use a medicine in it that clarifies and does not sting.
And strive your best while treating the wound that it be clean, that there be no harm to the fat or dirt in it, and do not let pus gather in it at all, because pus, if it gathers on the brain membrane, corrupts it and rots it, so a great affliction happens to the patient from that.
Blackness may appear on the surface of the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed from it, especially if its treatment is neglected, you have observed. If the symptoms we mentioned appear to the patient, then know that he is inevitably doomed.
And if the blackness only occurred from a medicine placed on it, and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then it is necessary to take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and beat them well and smear a cloth with them, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the types of treatment that are necessary until it heals.
