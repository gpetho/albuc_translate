It is necessary to remove from it what is visible to the eye after pressing the tongue with the instrument in the sunlight so that what is in the throat becomes clear to you.	After you have depressed the tongue with the instrument in the full light of the sun, so that what is stuck in the throat is made as conspicuous as possible, you should then remove whatever can be seen and comes into view.	0.78482807
And what is not visible to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before his food is digested in his stomach.

Or the patient swallows a piece of turnip or the root of lettuce. Or he swallows a morsel of dry bread. Or you take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a thread, then he swallows it. When it reaches the location of the fishbone, pull the thread quickly.	Or let him swallow a piece of turnip or a heart of lettuce or a morsel of dry bread; or take a marine sponge, dry, and tie it on a thread; then let him swallow the sponge and when it reaches where the sharp body is then quickly pull on the thread.	0.88274944

And he should be careful not to touch his larynx, lest it cause him to cough.	It should be a little thicker than a probe, with a crook at its extremity.

And he pushes the bone or thorn with it, or the physician inserts it with his hand, and the patient's insertion of it is better because of his knowledge of the location of the embedded thing. And he pushes downwards or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all of this according to what is possible for him until it comes out.	And let him remove therewith the bone or sharp body. Or else let the doctor introduce it with his hand (although it is better if the patient himself introduce it, since he knows the site of the obstruction) and push it down and then draw up his hand with the instrument; all this according to the way it presents itself to him, till it is removed.	0.8473204
