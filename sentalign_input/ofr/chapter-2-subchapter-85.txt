of the rupture of the belly/abdomen
The rupture of the belly/abdomen is large and medium and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestine, or the sinews of the intestines, protrude, making their insertion difficult;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in unless one replaces them promptly;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, thus making them more difficult to replace, and therefore the medium wound is better, because the intestine is more easily returned to its place than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the abdomen/belly occurs in four ways:
the two common sutures occur in the suturing of the abdomen/belly, and the suturing of other wounds of the body and two other specific sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more specific with the suturing of the abdomen/belly, and I will describe and explain each one.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put back, this is because of one of the two ways:
either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way:
wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or in which you cook squinant, cypress, and spikenard in water, and sprinkle the intestine until the swelling is gone;
and sometimes make this wine astringent, and it is better than plain water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been cooked, for by this the opening is soothed a little;
and if it cannot enter, then cut the wound a little with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, for no one should cut there unless there is great necessity;
and this is the instrument for cutting it:
cut inside the curve and not outside, and see here the shape:
And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, put it back according to its natural form in its proper place, if you are able, for that is much better.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head;
and if it is in the lower part of the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, take care that the injured part is higher than the other;
and thus one must manage what I say for large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, apply what is prepared for you, then have at hand a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common method of stitching, and it is that you take a needle or several, depending on the width of the wound, then leave a finger's width of space from the top of the wound, and insert a needle there with a good strong thread;
and pierce both edges of the skin along with both edges of the siphac, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce through to the other side, and bring the two edges of the siphac, all four together;
then tie it with a double thread around the needle on both sides, then bring the two edges of the wound together neatly, then leave a finger's width of space, and insert another needle there;
then tie it with the thread as you did the first needle, and continue doing this according to how many needles you need, until the entire wound is closed;
and the needles should be medium, between fine and thick, because fine needles cut through all the flesh, and those that are too thick cannot enter well:
therefore they must be medium-sized;
and the needles should not be placed too deep in the flesh and skin, so that they don't cut and open the wound before it heals;
and then cut off the heads of the needles, so they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and place tents or cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them still, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles are sufficient.
The second stitch is common, and is that you bring the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the muscle together with a needle threaded with a strong, medium-sized thread;
and when you have pierced all four of these edges together, bring the needle back to the side where you began, in the way that cloth is sewn;
and leave a space between each stitch the width of a little finger;
this stitch is common knowledge, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, who was wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than a handspan long, and his intestines were protruding a good two handspans, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I put his intestines back in after they had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was stitched up within fifteen days, and I treated him, and he was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle;
and I did not treat him with ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines;
and I simply put old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
take the needle, and push it from the outside part to the inside;
when it has pierced the center straight through, then take the end of the thread or suture where you pushed the needle, and make it pierce on the other side from inside to outside;
and the meaning of this stitch is that you sew as leatherworkers do hides, and that you leave the thread once on one side, and take it again on the other, until the stitching is complete.
The second way of stitching, which Galen specifically describes, is like some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and join one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the end of the wound nearby, and make it pierce only that spot, and leave the two ends of the thread;
then turn the needle and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce both from the outside to the inside, at two other ends of the wound that are on the other side;
and this is the best way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said these words, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, where there is thread in each one;
and one should push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The treatment of the wound is like the treatment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the air has changed it, so replace the intestine, and sew it;
then put on the powder generating flesh, and if the air has changed it, then put on some ointment that is available, until the wound swells;
and one hundred threads, and the superficial tissues should be joined, and the peritoneum;
then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you have no medicines, so put on, as soon as it begins to swell, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in most cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you are worried that the wound will spread to the principal members, then you must soak light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the groin, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or pus in the bowels, and it often happens, then give enemas of lukewarm dark wine, especially if the pus comes down to the intestine; 
and it pierces within, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the arrangement of the veins that are there, and because of the delicateness of the whole body, and the closeness of its nature to the nerves.
And if the omentum protrudes from the wound, put it back in just like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, you must tie off the place that is black, so that bleeding does not occur there, because there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the two ligatures, and let the two ends hang from the part below the wound down outside to ease the extraction when the omentum falls off, and the wound closes.
of the rupture of the scrotum
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, it can be repaired in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it festered and became a fistula, and the excrement and gas came out of it;
I treated it as best I could, and did not stop refining the treatment until he was healed, and the place closed.
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient would have pain in his belly;
and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, that it must be tied up in this manner:
Take wheat grains with large heads, then bring the lips of the wound together, and when the wheat grain has opened its mouth, place it on the two lips so that it tightens its mouth over them;
and then cut off the head, and it holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another wheat grain next to it in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely enclosed;
and sew the wound.
These heads then dry up in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is very thin, and then tie a thin twisted linen thread to the end of this thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine with it, and bring it back into the rupture;
and this method of stitching with wheat grains is only according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy or healing, except subtlety.
