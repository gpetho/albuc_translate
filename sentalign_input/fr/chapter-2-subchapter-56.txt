Of the pustules of the penis
Many times these pustules appear on the penis, and it is an ugly appearance of flesh; and there are malignant and non-malignant ones; then you must take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then put cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on them; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the pustule is malignant, of a rotten color and smelling bad, then you must use cautery. When you have cut it, and if the pustule is at the top of the penis, and is partly inside the skin and partly outside, then you must remove the pustule that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside. Because when you treat them together, the tip of the penis is not safe from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicles; then you must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate peel and vetch, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then use the lunar cautery in this form: the cautery helps in two conditions together: namely, for bleeding, and for corruption; and if the tip of the penis is corrupt and contracted, then you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient urinates through it; and when the skin becomes attached at the tip of the penis which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens from a wound or abscess, then you must peel it with a fine instrument, until the attachment is loosened, and the tip of the penis is freed from all sides;
and if it is a difficult thing to separate it, then you must peel it with a spatula a little bit from the tip of the penis and the skin; then gently separate between the two, and place a fine linen cloth soaked in cold water, so it does not reattach.
