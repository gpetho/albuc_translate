Chapter XX.
On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and does not cause harm or impairment in vision, you should leave the patient, follow up, and apply cupping on the neck without scarification and suck well; then apply a liniment made of acatra, aloe, resin, and sarcocolla on the eye, and tighten the dressing on the eye with many layers.
The way to make the layers is to take cloths of lion hair, each cloth folded in four layers; and make those layers.
Then place them one on top of the other according to the amount needed by the eye.
Then tighten them with a hard cloth with strong pressure; repeat the cupping without scarification; then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye tight day and night.
But if the binding becomes soft in the meantime, then it needs to be very tight.
Then remove the binding day and night as we have said.
And if the eye is already reduced, that is good; if not, then repeat the plaster with the layers, the pressure, and the cupping until it is healed.
