of the body of tears
When the tears of the eyes are old and habitual and are on the veins, or next to the arteries that are in the visible part of the head;
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I spoke of at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes:
One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or cauterizations under the two bones;
and if there is need for more, then cauterize him carefully above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
