CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO.	Chapter 22.	0.61042476
This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so.	This condition called Alcomnati is merely pus that collects in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not actually that.	0.64189863
The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you.	And the method of treating it is to have the patient sit on a prepared or straightened seat.	0.61486655
Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before. But if it does not come down, we know it is cataract.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus descending to the lower part before your eyes. Then let it settle, and not descend further, and the vision will clear: and the patient will see things as he saw them before: if it does not descend downward, know that it is water.	0.8058953
But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out.	If, however, the descent of the pus is not achieved with the method we mentioned, then have the patient sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and make a small incision with it above the corneal membrane near the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer at the top, until the pus flows out.	0.8513898
When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey. Then treat as usual till healed.	When it flows out, then instill in the eye warm water mixed with honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.	0.7862328
