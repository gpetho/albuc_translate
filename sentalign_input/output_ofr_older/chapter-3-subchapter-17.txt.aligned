Of the fracture of the foot bones	On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.	0.68534803
Fractures do not occur at the ankle, but sometimes there are fractures in the bones of the foot and rarely in the toes, and it usually results in a break in multiple places.	The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are. The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.	0.7366961
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see the bones overlapping, have the patient place their foot on the ground, as if they were going to walk, then place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, and press until they return to their places; then apply the poultice and padding, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then bind it to the foot properly, after wrapping cloth around it, and other necessary things.	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking. Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place. Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads. After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.	0.92453796
And after three or four days have passed, unbind the bandage, because you will find the bones are even, whether fractured or dislocated.	When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.	0.84020543
And if any of the toes are fractured, restore them as we said for the fingers of the hand; then place a splint on the fractured toe according to the length of the toe, and it should be a little wider, then place under the foot the board I mentioned, and bind it properly; and if two or three or more toes are fractured, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrap in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and stand on the edge of the board outside the arch of the foot, so that it holds well.	If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it. Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly. If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.	0.9255004
And you must not forget the other things I said for other fractures, as we mentioned; and address each condition as needed.	And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.	0.8452878
