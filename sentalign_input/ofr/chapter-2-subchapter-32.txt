When the tooth does not appear according to the natural body, and the shape is ugly, and especially in young women, so you must know if the tooth has grown in next to the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot file it or polish it: then file it; and if it is higher than the tooth, take this instrument of which this is the shape, and it looks like a small beak, and let it be of Indian steel, sharp at the tip: 
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is visible so that it can be filed, then file it with such a file as this is the shape:
and it is like the file with which needles are made; and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls; then smooth it at the end with a scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it injures the tongue, it is necessary to file the sharpness until it is even, so that it does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
