On the method of cauterizing in cases of epilepsy.	On cauterizing for epilepsy.	0.75785446
Epileptics should only be cauterized if their condition is caused by phlegm.	The epileptic who may be cauterized is he whose epilepsy arises from phlegm.	0.4937209
Thus, the brain must first be cleansed with hyeeras and other treatments mentioned in the section on disease division, especially if the patient is an adult or can tolerate medicines.	When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.6252446
However, if the patient is a child and cannot tolerate medication, administer gargles and chewing agents that purify the brain over several days along with good dietary practices.	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet.	0.82912713
Then, shave his head, and apply one cautery in the middle of the head as previously outlined, one on the back of the head, and one on each corner of the head. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply cauteries as described for paralysis and body relaxation, along the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, using the olive-shaped cautery as previously described.	Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity.	0.87657905
For children, however, use a finer cautery, following this approach.	If the patient be a boy, use a fine cautery.	0.59118354
