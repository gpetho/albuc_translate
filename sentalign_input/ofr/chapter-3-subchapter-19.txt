of fracture with a wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as in the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, as the healings that we have described demonstrate.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol if you have nothing else, then begin to restore the fracture in that same hour, or that day, if hot abscesses do not arise.
And if hot abscesses arise, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are calmed, and do not touch them on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad outcome.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the open flesh, then you must set it lightly with your hands, using slight extension.
And if the extension devices are not ready for you to use with your hands, then set it with this instrument which is made of iron, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound;
and for this reason the physician needs to obtain three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and it should be round and a little thick, so that it does not bend under the pressure on the limb during your work, and it should be pointed at the front, and thicker from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called "lever," because the curved end must be placed on the end of the exposed bone;
and push it at once, until it returns, and is aligned with the other.
And if the fracture is fine, and the instrument cannot grip the bone well, then you must trim the end of the bone, so that the instrument can have a hold on it.
And if you cannot reduce the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able; 
then smooth what remains of the bone's roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is set, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
So work until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in dark, astringent wine, and especially if it is in summer; 
and do not put on the wound a cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then apply splints once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and fit the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted by the bandage; 
and many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused the patient to die or sometimes to become crippled;
and the bandaging should be softer and gentler than other bandages.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that a bad outcome might occur, as we have said, and you find pain at the location, then you should not apply splints;
but wrap around, instead of splints, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, then remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrapharmacum ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and healthy.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the pus flows downwards easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continually produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, for which you must explore the wound with a probe, and remove all these separated pieces which cause this pain.
And if a fistula develops at the site, or another kind of infection, you must treat it according to what is said in its chapter earlier.
And when the bone is broken, and exposed on the limb, like the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not pull on it, because death often results, but leave it until it rots;
perhaps it will fall off by itself after 20 or 30 days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
