About the eye nail
Know that the eye nail (a growth on the eye) is of two types: one is nervous and resembles a hard surface, and another that is not nervous but resembles congealed white moisture, which when touched with iron or tried to be taken with pincers, cannot be grasped; and both types start near the large tear duct and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, all the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of the incision is that the patient places his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then take the nail with small pincers and stretch it above; then take a needle, and place a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and bend the point of the needle a little and stick it into the nail, and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it above, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil and the silk to the end, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the delicate spatula and small scissors, and leave the natural flesh at the tear duct, so that the usual flow of tears does not come from the incision; and sometimes the nail extends to the hook only, and the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with the soft spatula, which is of this form:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the fleshy tissue and tear it, and that the pupil is not pierced; and after the incision, throw a little ground salt into the eye, and eyewash made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot place the needle, and the hook cannot enter, many times this type of nail is treated with medicines; and they grow as I have described in the division, and if you want to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take the light, slightly sharp spatula, in this form:
And lift the nail delicately, and if you see that it diminishes to a point and the root approaches, then distill from your mouth into the eye eyewash made of litharge and red eyewash and ground salt, and cover the eye until the next day; then restart the procedure with this same work, until it is all removed.
If anything is not contrary in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then restart the procedure as before, until it is healed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct greatly harms the eye, then suspend it with the hook, and cut a part of it but not all, so that the flow of tears does not come; then distill into the eye red eyewash made of litharge.
