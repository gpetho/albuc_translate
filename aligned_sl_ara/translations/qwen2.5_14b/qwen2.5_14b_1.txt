The author of this book, having completed for you, my sons, this book which is a part of the complete science of medicine and reached its limit in clarity and explanation, saw fit to complete it with this discourse which is a part of practical work with the hand.
Because practical work with the hand has entirely disappeared in our country and in our time, to the point that the science of it is nearly forgotten and its practice has ceased. And only a few illustrations of it remain in the books of our predecessors, which hands have corrupted, error and confusion have befallen, to the point that their meanings are obscured and their benefits are distant.
So I decided to revive it and compose this discourse in a way that explains, clarifies, and abbreviates. I will also provide illustrations of cautery instruments and other tools needed for work, as this increases clarity and aids what is necessary.
And the reason there is no skilled craftsman in our time who can do this with his hands, is that the practice of medicine is extensive and its practitioner should first engage himself in the study of anatomy, which Galen has described. Until he understands the benefits, forms, temperaments, connections, and disconnections of the organs, as well as the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, origins, arteries, veins, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore, Avicenna said that there are many doctors in name but few in reality, especially in the practice of the hand. We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.
Because one who is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned regarding anatomy may fall into errors that can kill people, as I have often witnessed with those who imagine themselves to be experts in this science without knowledge or understanding.
This is because I saw an ignorant doctor who cut into a pig-like tumor on a woman's neck, thereby cutting some of the neck arteries and causing the woman to bleed to death before him.
I also saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from a man with bladder problems, and the stone was large. He rushed and removed it along with a piece of the bladder wall. The man died after about three days, and I was called to remove the stone. I saw from the condition of the stone and the state of the patient what had led to that outcome.
I also saw another doctor who earned his living by practicing medicine at the patronage of some patrons in our city.
A young black boy who was under his care had a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound. The doctor, out of his ignorance, quickly applied the splints and bandages too tightly over the fracture and the wound, not leaving any space for the wound to breathe.
Then he let the boy go and indulge in his desires, leaving him for days without releasing the bandages. As a result, the boy's leg and foot swelled, and he was on the brink of death.
I was called to attend to him, and I quickly loosened the bandages. The boy gained some relief and alleviation from his pain, but the damage had already become severe in the affected part, and I could not reverse it.
The damage continued to spread in the affected part until he died.
I also saw another doctor who lanced a malignant tumor, and it became ulcerated after several days, leading to severe suffering for the patient. This is because when cancer is of a pure black type, it should never be treated with an iron instrument at all.
except that it is in a part that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that work done with the hand is divided into two kinds: work that goes along with safety and work that usually results in damage.
I have warned in every place in this book where there is risk and danger; therefore, you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant cannot find a way to speak and criticize, take caution and care for yourselves, and treat your patients with kindness and certainty.
Use the best method that leads to safety and a commendable outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
Abstain from what you fear might cast doubt upon your religion and worldly affairs, for it is safer for your reputation and higher in both this world and the next for your destinies.
Galen said in some of his advices: Do not treat a bad disease and thus become known as bad doctors.
I have divided this article into three sections.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization with fire and sharp medicines, categorized and organized from the head to the foot, including illustrations of instruments, tools for cauterization, and everything needed in manual work.
The Second Chapter.
On incision, closing wounds, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, extracting arrows, and similar procedures, all categorized and organized with illustrations of instruments.
The Third Chapter.
On bone setting, reduction of dislocations, treatment of wounds, and similar topics, categorized and organized from the finger to the toe, with illustrations of instruments.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization.
And before mentioning how to use it, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms and in which temperament it is used.
I say that the discussion about the manner in which cauterization is beneficial and harmful is a lengthy discourse, a precise science, and a hidden secret. Many sages have spoken about it.
They disagreed on this matter, and I have briefly summarized their discussions to avoid prolonging the text.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for all bad temperaments that occur with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they disagreed on it. Some say that cauterization is beneficial in this case, while others argue the opposite, stating that cauterization is not suitable for a disease caused by heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured from a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry treatment. The one who argues the opposite says that cauterization with fire may benefit a hot and dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add the body of a human and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you affect the human body with cold.
And I agree with his statement because experience has revealed this to me many times, though it should only be conceived by those who have extensively trained and gained expertise in the art of cauterization. And he observed the differences in the temperaments of people and the conditions of diseases in themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially for cold and moist diseases, as all physicians have agreed upon them and have not differed regarding the benefit of cauterization in treating them.
Know, my children, that the secret of treating with cauterization by fire and its superiority over medicinal cauterization is that fire is a single essence whose effect does not spread to other organs; it only affects the part that is cauterized, causing minimal harm to adjacent parts.
Cauterization by a burning medicine may extend its effect to subsequent organs, and it might cause a disease in the organ that is difficult to treat or even lead to death. Fire, due to its nobility and noble essence, does not do this unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience gained from long service, careful attention to the craft, and observing the realities of the matter.
For this reason, I have spared myself the lengthy discourse. However, if it were befitting for my book, I would have presented to you a hidden secret about fire and its effect on bodies in philosophical and demonstrative language, which might exceed your understanding.
And know, my sons, that they have disagreed about the time suitable for cauterization and have considered the springtime to be the best period.
And I say that cauterization may be suitable at any time, because the harm caused by the time is outweighed by the benefit gained from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for essential and severe pains that cannot be postponed, due to the fear of consequences that could be worse than the minor harm caused by the time.
And do not let it occur to your minds, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine: that cauterization which cures a disease from which there is no return will become a permanent blemish.
And it is not as they suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries up the humors which are the cause of pains.
However, cauterization is preferable to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its effect, and the power of its influence.
And it is possible for the disease to recur at some time depending on the patient's temperament, the persistence and strength of the disease, and what accumulates in his body from excesses and neglect in acquiring necessary nutrients and similar causes.
Except when the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one in an organ with little excess moisture and humors. Like extracting a tooth for pain and the like, it may be that the pain does not return, and this is rare.
And as for the common belief that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, this statement is correct, not what they themselves believe, because they think that no treatment will be effective with medication or otherwise after the occurrence of cauterization, whereas the matter is contrary to this.
And the meaning of "cauterization is the last resort of medicine" is that whenever we have used various methods of treatment for a disease and those medications were ineffective, then we use cauterization as the final method which may be effective. Therefore, it is said that cauterization is the last resort of medicine. Not in the meaning that the general public and many ignorant physicians have adopted.
I mentioned earlier that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence. They also said that the place where gold is used for cauterization does not become ulcerated, but this is not always the case.
Because I have experimented with that and found that it only happens in some bodies and not others. Cauterization with gold is indeed better and preferable to iron, as they said, except that when you heat the cauterizing tool from gold in fire, you cannot tell when it has reached the desired temperature by its color.
And because it quickly cools down, and if you increase its heat in fever, it melts in the fire and spills over, causing the practitioner to be distracted by this. Therefore, cauterization with iron has become faster and closer to accuracy for practical use, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, organizing them from the head to the foot so that it may be easy for the student to find what he desires, God willing.
The first chapter.
On cauterizing the head with one cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for the dominance of humidity and coldness over the brain, which are causes of headache, frequent discharges from the head towards the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, tooth pain, and throat pains. In general, it is beneficial for all diseases caused by coldness such as paralysis, epilepsy, syncope, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is that the patient should first be ordered to vomit with a purgative and cleansing medicine for three nights or four, depending on the strength, age, and habits of the patient.
Then order him to shave his head with scissors, and then seat him in front of you in a squatting position with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive oil cauterization instrument, which has this appearance.
Reveal the bone to the size of a chickpea or a mustard seed, and if you have raised your hand too soon, repeat with the same instrument or another one if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I have described to you, then take some salt and dissolve it in water. Soak a piece of cotton in it and place it on the spot and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in fat on it and leave it until the redness from the inflammation subsides. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, if God wills.
They say that a wound, when left open, extends the pus and is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should remain in place until part of the thickness of the bone is burned. Then remove what has been burned from the bone afterward and treat it.
Others say that cauterization should be excessive until it affects the bone strongly, causing small pieces to fall off like a kernel or a small bowl. They claim that this allows steam from the head to dissipate and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it heals. I do not see these two types of cauterization at all except in some people, and using them is risky; leaving them out is better in my opinion. If that is the case, then the head weakens when its natural connection is disrupted, as we have seen with other body parts.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion. Use it, and you will be safe if God wills.
The second chapter.
فيكيء الرأس أيضًا.
إذا حدث في جمجمة الرأس وجع مزمن وطال ذلك بالعليل واستعمل الإيارجات والقوقايات والسعوطات والأدهان والضمادات، ولا سيما إن كان قد كوى الكيّة الواحدة التي وصفنا فلم ينفعه شيء من ذلك فانظر. فإن كان رأس العليل قوي البنية بالطبع ولم يكن ضعيفا وكان يجد بردًا شديدًا فاكوه كيّة أخرى فوق تلك قليلا. ثم اكوه على كل قرن من رأسه كيّة حتى يذهب ثخن الجلد وينكشف من العظم القطر الذي وصفنا. واكوه كيّة في مؤخر رأسه في الموضع الذي يعرف بالفأس وخفف يدك في هذه ولا تكشف العظم فإن العليل يجد لها ألما شديدا خلاف ألم سائر كيّات الرأس كلها وسأذكر هذه الكيّة في موضعها.
ويجب أن تكون المكواة التي يكوى بها قرني الرأس ومؤخرته ألطف من المكواة التي يكوى بها وسط الرأس وهذه صورتها.
ال第三节章节。
For the acute migraine.
If pain and headache occur in the head split and the pain extends to the eye, induce vomiting with purgative medicines for the head and use all the treatments mentioned in the classifications of diseases. If this does not succeed, cauterization should be performed on it in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp burning agent or with iron.
Cauterization with a burning agent is done by taking one clove of garlic, peeling it, and cutting its ends from both sides. Then, cut an incision in the location of the pain on the cheekbone using a broad scalpel until it reaches beneath the skin where the garlic can fit.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then wrap it securely with a bandage tightly. Leave it for fifteen hours, then remove the bandage and take out the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply a cotton pad soaked in fat to the area until it becomes pus-filled, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If you prefer, you can do this with some burning medicines that I mentioned in Article Eighteen on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is done in this manner: Heat the cautery tool which has this shape:.
It is called the screw-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some indentations and a small protrusion in the center.
Then place it on the site of the pain and hold your hand while you rotate the iron slightly, and the amount that you burn from the thickness of the skin should be like half of its thickness. Then raise your hand so that you do not burn the artery below, which would cause bleeding. Then soak a piece of cotton in salt water and place it on the site and leave it for three days. Then soak the cotton in oil, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this abscess with the heated blade of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this non-chronic abscess especially.
Chapter Four.
Treating Chronic Abscesses.
If you treat the abscess with the methods mentioned previously and what was discussed in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see that the condition requires something beyond what was mentioned of cauterization with medication or cauterization with fire. You should heat the cautery blade until it turns white. Then, mark along the site of the pain with a line about half a finger's width or so. Place your hand once and pull tight enough to cut the artery but not too deep to reach the bone.
However, you should be cautious not to touch the moving jaw during chewing, as burning the muscle or nerve that controls it can cause convulsions.
Be cautious and vigilant about the bleeding from the artery that you have cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what to do and has no tested experience; it is better to refrain from acting.
A discussion on how to manage bleeding from an artery will come in its proper place later in the book, if God wills. If you encounter a condition that cannot be addressed by this method, note it.
If you see that the patient's body can withstand it, apply a cautery in the middle of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, if God wills.
If you wish, use the cautery mentioned in the section on treating an artery with a double-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective method.
Chapter Five.
On the cautery for earaches.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then heat the cautery called "al-nidhru," which has this shape.
Then, after heating it, apply it in dots around the entire ear as it circles, or around both ears if the pain is in both. Then, after applying the cauterization slightly away from the base of the ear, mark the spots with a coolant, and the cautery should consist of about ten dots in each ear or thereabouts. Then treat the spots until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Six.
فيك القوة.
The strength that is treated with cauterization is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
Cauterization should be avoided for the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you have treated this type of strength with iatrological methods, spongings, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations. One at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third where the lips meet.
Make the cauterization from the opposite side of the affected area because relaxation occurs on the seemingly healthy side.
The image of the cauterization is that you should cauterize once opposite the upper part of the ear, below the horn of the head a little, and another at the temple, and its length should be as long as the width of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until it burns to half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery, which is a type of knife-like instrument that was described earlier but is slightly finer as you can see. It should have a blade that is slightly thicker, then treat the area as previously described until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Seven.
About chronic paralysis.
If chronic paralysis persists despite the treatments mentioned and your treatment is ineffective, and there is no fever in the patient, apply four cauterizations. Apply one cauterization to each horn of the head, one cauterization in the middle of the head as mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously described.
Apply the cauterizations as described. Additionally, cauterize one point at the mouth of the stomach, which will be more effective, then proceed with the treatments as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
About cauterization for forgetfulness.
Those who suffer from phlegm should be given large doses of ayargat (a type of medicine) and purifying pills for the brain initially.
Then, shave his entire head and apply a mustard plaster to the back of his head as described in the section on plasters. Do this multiple times, as it is equivalent to cauterization.
Follow the procedure exactly as mentioned there. If he recovers, that is sufficient; otherwise, cauterize him three times at the back of his head, arranged from the top of the head to the base of the neck.
Leave a space of one finger's width between each cauterization, then treat the cauterizations as previously described. If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, perform an additional cauterization in the middle.
If you wish to increase it, remove it from the horns and then treat it until it heals, and the iron should be olive-colored as in the previous description.
Chapter Nine.
For treating hemiplegia and general relaxation of the body.
It is necessary to begin with cleansing the head with iatrological treatments as mentioned, then shave the patient's head and cauterize it with one cautery in the center of the head, one on each horn of the head, and one at the back.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If the condition of general relaxation of the body requires more than this, and if the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and persistent, cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of his back. Burn extensively until most of the skin is burned, then lift your hand and treat him as previously described until he heals, if God wills, and the cautery should be olive-colored.
Chapter Ten.
For treating epilepsy with cauterization.
A person with epilepsy caused by phlegm should be cauterized, and initially, his brain should be cleansed with major iatrological treatments and all other treatments mentioned in the classification if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking medicines.
If the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then use gargles and purgatives that cleanse the brain several days before, along with improving their diet.
Then he shaves his head, then applies one cautery in the middle of the head as described in the description, and another cautery at the back of his head. And on each horn of his head, a cautery. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply the cauterizations mentioned for one suffering from paralysis and relaxation of the body along the vertebrae of the neck and back; the cautery should be olive-colored as described previously.
If the patient is a child, then make the cautery gentle as described in this illustration.
Chapter Eleven.
On Cauterizing Mania.
If the cause of mania is putrid humidity and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations mentioned for one suffering from paralysis.
If the cause of mania is excess that tends towards black bile and the patient's body is humidified, give him what purifies his brain as described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight pad of linen in the shape of a circle, and place it in the middle of his head while the patient is seated with his legs folded and holding onto something from all sides. Then take one pound of old lamb fat.
Then heat it over the fire to a moderate warmth, such that a finger can withstand it when inserted. Then pour it into the middle of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once every week along with other proper treatment until he recovers, if God wills.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small dots without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather let it be a light touch, for this kind of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply cotton soaked in fat or chicken fat to it.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing the watery discharge in the eye.
When you have identified the beginning of the watery discharge in the eye by the signs mentioned in the classification, then promptly treat the patient to cleanse his head and protect it from all moisture. Sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then have him shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of the head, then cauterize two spots on the cheeks if the discharge starts from both eyes or one spot if it is from one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be as long as the width of the cheeks, and be careful not to cause bleeding.
If you see any of it, cut it as needed by whatever treatment is possible. We will come to the wisdom in removing and cutting the arteries while being careful not to cause bleeding.
He may be cauterized at the back of the head under the two bones with two strong cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and constant, and they come from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head outside the skull, and you are sure that this is due to excess cold phlegm, then use the cautery as I have described at the beginning of the flow of blood. Cauterize in the middle of the head and two places on each cheekbone, and two places at the back of the head under the two bones. If more is needed, cauterize one place on each side near the end of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On Cauterizing a Putrid Nose.
If the treatment mentioned in the division does not succeed, then immediately treat the patient with Cochlearia officinalis for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle part with an olive oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with a screw-shaped cautery iron two places above the eyebrows under the hair slightly, and be careful not to cut the artery. This is an image of the screw-shaped cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
On Cauterizing the Drooping Eyelid.
If the eyelid droops due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
If you wish, cauterize two places slightly above the eyebrows on each side, and keep a distance from the cheekbones. The length of each cautery mark should be as long as the eyebrow.
Do not overdo it with the cauterization; rather, do it to the extent that one-third of the skin burns. The shape of the cautery iron should be as follows.
Chapter Sixteen.
On Cauterizing the Eyelid.
If her eyelids turn inward, open the eye and cauterize it in two types. Cauterization can be done either with fire or with a burning medication. As for cauterizing with fire, instruct the patient to stop plucking their eyelashes if they do so, until they grow long and even.
If it turns inward at its base, bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow. When they have grown and are even, place the patient's head in your lap and mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of an oak leaf.
The marking should start near the eyelashes. Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or sparrow saliva under the eyelid, and heat the cautery iron whose shape is as described.
Then cauterize along the marked shape little by little in many sessions until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of an oak leaf, is fully burned. The sign of a successful procedure is that the eyelid will retract and the hair will lift away from the eye socket.
At that point, lift your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply a cotton pad with grease to help the scab fall off, and treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If some hair regrows after some time and the eyelid relaxes again.
Repeat the cautery on that place as you did initially. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, pluck it until it returns to its natural position without piercing the eye. As for cauterization with a burning drug, order the patient to leave the eyelashes so they grow long and straight.
Then make a paper figure of an oak leaf. Take one drachma or so each of the usual soap and unslaked lime, and grind them together finely. Do this in a mortar so that they do not dry out. Then apply it to the paper you made in the shape of an oak leaf and place it on one or both eyelids. Place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and have the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger above the medicine and press it lightly while moving it whenever the patient feels a tingling from the medicine, as he will feel a burning sensation like fire. As long as the patient feels this tingling, leave the medicine in place and move it with your finger. When the tingling subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Observe, and if you see the eyelid raised as it would be when cauterized with fire or cut, then do nothing further. If not, repeat applying the medicine to the area that was unaffected by the medicine and did not darken until you complete your work and cauterize the eye. Then place cotton soaked in fat on it until the burning irritation subsides.
Then treat it with a cream such as the palm-based one or another until it heals. When working, be extremely careful that no part of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after days and you suspect any hair in the eye.
Prepare the medicine on that part of the eyelid that has relaxed as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is a picture of an oak leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so adjust accordingly. The way of correctness is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the nasal abscess that occurs in the duct of the eye.
If you treat the abscess as mentioned in the sections on diseases and your treatment is not effective, it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have a servant hold the patient's head still so that it does not move or shake.
Then place a cotton pad moistened in the white of an egg or in the saliva of a weasel on his eyes, then heat the cautery, which is depicted here.
Make the cautery hollow, like the shape of a eagle feather from one end where the cauterization will occur. If you prefer, it can be perforated at the other end, or solid like a rod; however, this hollow type is better for your work, if God wills.
Then squeeze the abscess if it is open and remove the pus, then dry it. If it is not open, cut it open and remove its pus. Then place the hot cautery on it immediately; hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Move your hand a little away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing so that you do not miss or disturb the patient causing the cautery iron to fall into the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cautery, otherwise repeat the cautery once if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a bandage with grease and treat it with the dried ointment until it heals. If after forty days it has not healed, then apply a sharp medicinal treatment until the bone is exposed, and proceed as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another approach to cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some early practitioners, is to deliberately cut open the area of the fistula and then place a thin tube in the same incision; this is its illustration.
Pour in an amount equal to the weight of one dirham of melted lead and hold the tube firmly with a tight grip, and the patient must not move at all so that the melted lead does not flow into his eye. It is advisable to place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead will burn the area of the fistula and heal it miraculously. If the fistula heals as mentioned using cauterization and treatment, otherwise it is necessary to use nasal puncture and redirect the fistula into the nasal passage as will be described in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Cauterizing a Cleft Lip.
Often, a cleft occurs in the lip called al-sihat, especially in the lips of children. It often happens that when you treat this cleft as mentioned in the division [of the text], if the treatment does not succeed, heat a small knife-like iron smoothing tool in this manner.
Make the inside as thin as the blade of a knife, then place it while hot into the same cleft until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft, then treat it with the quilator until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing fresh fistulas in the mouth.
If a swelling occurs at the base of the gum or on the palate or at the roots of the teeth, and it becomes abscessed and bursts, resulting in a fistula from the pus flow, then if you treat it and the treatment is not successful, you should heat an iron cautery to fit the size of the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the fistula hole and hold it until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterward with the treatments mentioned until it heals, if God wills.
If the substance is interrupted and it heals, otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the diseased bone as will be mentioned in its chapter, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing loose teeth and gums.
If the gums have loosened due to moisture and the teeth have become loose, and you have treated them with medicines but they were ineffective, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery that its image will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Insert the hot cautery into it quickly, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels that the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand and insert the cautery again as many times as you wish. Then have the patient rinse his mouth with salt water.
Hold it for an hour and then spit it out. The loose tooth will become stable, the relaxed gum will tighten, and the harmful moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On Treating Toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or there are worms in the tooth and medication has not been effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either by using fat or by using fire.
Cauterization with fat is done by taking beef tallow and boiling it in an iron ladle or a shell. Then take a piece of cotton, wrap it on the end of a probe, dip it into the boiled fat, and quickly place it on the painful tooth, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, you can dip a piece of wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the painful tooth, then put a heated iron over it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
And as for cauterization with fire, it is that you take a copper or iron tube, and it should have some thickness so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery, which will be depicted in its form, and place it on the tooth itself; hold your hand until the cautery cools down, and do this repeatedly.
And the pain will go either that very day or the next. After this cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good fat and hold it for an hour before spitting it out. This is the image of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as much as possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On Cauterizing Pigs.
If the pigs are affected by phlegm and cold moisture and do not respond to maturity through medications, and you wish for rapid maturation, then heat the hollow cautery, whose image is shown here, with both ends perforated.
To allow smoke to exit from the other end during cauterization, place it protectively on the same tumor once or twice if necessary until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery proportionate to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton pad soaked in fat until what was burned by the fire is healed, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
في كيّ البحة وضيق النفس.
إذا غلبت الرطوبات على قصبة الرئة ولا سيما إذا كان ذلك مع برودة المزاج، فينبغي أن يستفرغ العليل أولًا بالأدوية المسهلة، ثم تكويه كيّة في نقرة النحر عند أصل الحلقوم في الموضع المنخفض.
فاحذر أن تصل بالكي إلى الحلقوم ولا تحرق من الجلد إلا نصفة، ثم اكوه كيّة أخرى عند مفصل العنق في آخر خرزة منه بليغة وتكون المكواة مسمارية على الصفة التي تقدمت.
ثم عالجه بما تقدم ذكره حتى يبرأ إن شاء الله.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
في كيّ مرض الرئة والسعال.
إذا كان السعال ومرض الرئة عن رطوبات باردة ولم يكن بالعليل حمى ولا سل وكان المرض مزمنا فاكوه كيّتين فوق الترقوتين في المواضع المنخفضة اللينة الفارغة وكيّة أخرى في وسط الصدر بين الثديين.
وتكون المكواة مسمارية على الصورة التي تقدمت، وإن شئت فليكثف كيّه بالنقاط بالمكواة التي تسمى النقطة وقد تقدّمت صورتها في تنقيط وجع الأذنين وتكون النقط من ثلاثين نقطة إلى نحوها.
Then treat it as previously described until it heals. You can also make a tongued cautery with three prongs as shown in this figure, and use it quickly because you can cauterize three areas at once with it, and here is the figure of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Cauterizing the Armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery rheumatics or does not stabilize when it is reduced, so that it becomes habitual for it to dislocate with even slight movement as we have observed, then the shoulder should be reduced first. Then the patient should lie on his back or on the affected side. Then raise the skin inside the armpit upwards with your left fingers if the joint has dislocated inwardly.
Then heat the double-bladed cautery whose figure is shown here.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, forming four cautery marks. It can also be cauterized with a three-pronged cautery, in which case six cautery marks will form, and the prongs should be placed on the thin part of the skin.
And this is the figure of the three-pronged cautery.
It can also include one more, making the cautery marks eight. Then apply cauterized seeds ground with salt to the area, and the patient should remain immobile for a period of time until it strengthens. If the dislocation is upward, which is rare.
A single good nail-shaped cautery above the shoulder or many dotted cauteries, for the joint will strengthen, moisture will disappear, and the patient will be cured.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Cauterizing the Stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, causing it to deviate from its normal condition and leading to frequent downward discharges, and if various treatments have been ineffective, the patient should lie on his back with arms and legs extended, and then three cauterizations should be applied. A nail-shaped cautery should be applied under the chest spoon by the width of a finger, and two cauterizations below each side of the single cautery until their shape forms a triangle, with sufficient distance between them to prevent them from meeting if they become pus-filled. The depth of the cautery should be one-third the thickness of the skin, and this is the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, without addition.
If you prefer, apply one large cautery in the center of the stomach in this manner.
The cautery instrument used for this single cautery should be in the shape of a circle as shown.
The stomach may also be cauterized with dotted cauteries for those who are anxious about the large cautery. This involves marking dots on the stomach in the desired quantity with a solution, then applying a dotted-shaped cautery, followed by treatment as previously described until recovery occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
Regarding the cold biliary temperament.
If pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture, or due to a noxious vapor such that it deviates from its natural temperament excessively, and the patient is treated with what was mentioned in the classification but to no avail. The patient should lie on his stomach, and three cauteries should be applied with a cautery fluid in this shape and exactly this size on the liver, below the armpits where a person's forearm ends.
Each cauterization should be about the thickness of a finger apart from the previous one. The cauterization should be straight along the length of the body. Do not hold the cautery tool too tightly, but rather loosely.
The amount of the skin thickness that should be burned is half its thickness, no more. The patient should stand on both feet; if he cannot stand, he should lie down with his legs extended and arms raised. This is a picture of the cautery tool.
You may apply these cauterizations with a knife cautery if you are skilled and careful in the practice to avoid excessive burning, which could burn through the skin entirely and reach the intestines, as the skin there is thin. Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Regarding the cauterization of swelling in the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you want to determine whether the swelling is in the liver tissue or in its membrane, if it is in the liver tissue, then the patient will feel heavy pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the region of the liver, there is a very sharp pain, and I have seen that its treatment has exhausted the skills of physicians. It is necessary for the patient to lie on his back, then apply hot compresses to the affected area.
Then heat the iron in the fire; this is the iron that resembles a mel (a tool similar to a knife or curved blade), and here is its image. Burn it with one cautery until the skin is completely burned, and continue the cauterization until you reach the peritoneum so that all of it comes out, then treat it as you would treat an abscess until he recovers.
This type of cauterization should not be used except by those who have long experience in the practice of medicine and have repeatedly encountered these diseases through experience. At that point, they may proceed with such a procedure, though I prefer to avoid it.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Appendicitis.
I have described earlier the cauterization for cold appendicitis using the root of the zarawnad in this manner: take one root of the dry and long zarawnad, as thick as a finger, and make it as long as possible. Then dip it in oil and light it in the fire. Then burn it with one cautery between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly below the jugular veins on the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly inclined backward, another in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind one between the shoulders and two at the sides of the spine below the cautery which is between the shoulders.
You should not penetrate deeply with the cautery but rather keep it on the surface of the skin for a smearing effect. Some early authors mentioned that there were people who used an iron cautery shaped like a needle, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And the duration is as mentioned for a liver tumor. Cauterizing this area carries great risks; either the patient may die immediately, or an incurable fistula may develop in the affected area.
Chapter Thirty.
On Cauterizing the Spleen.
If you treat a spleen disease with the methods mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are correct. One way is to cauterize it with three or four cauteries arranged along the length of the spleen.
Arrange them like the cauteries of the liver, whose form has been described previously. The distance between each cauterization should be the thickness of a finger or slightly more. The shape of the cautery should be as mentioned for cauterizing the liver. Do not penetrate deeply with the cautery, and the patient should lie on his back.
Another approach is at the left armpit. Raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left arm ends, and raise the skin across the width of the body so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the cauteries very carefully until they penetrate the skin from the other side, then remove the cautery; there will be four cauterizations. If you wish, use the other cautery with three cauteries.
Then treat the cauterized area after leaving it to suppurate for many days, as this is more effective than other previously mentioned treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Cauterizing Ascites.
Cauterization is beneficial specifically for dropsical ascites. If you treat the patient with various treatments we have mentioned in the classification and they are ineffective, then you should cauterize four cauteries around the navel and one on the abdomen.
Another cautery on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind his back between the shoulder blades, one opposite his chest and another opposite his abdomen. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin, then leave the wound open to suppurate for a long time.
Do not neglect treatment for the patient after cauterization with what is necessary to achieve both purposes and thus hasten recovery. The shape of the cautery used on the back should be screw-shaped as previously described, and the one used on the abdomen should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On Cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
If they become swollen in the edematous area and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the indentation between the little toe and the ring toe.
Keep your hand steady with the cautery and do not tilt it, then raise your hand without returning it at all, for the yellow water will drain. The cautery should be in this form.
Then cauterize on each leg with two cauteries; the cautery should be done using the sharp end of the cautery and should be applied along the length of the leg, one above the knee and another below it towards the middle of the thigh. On each thigh, apply two cauteries.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, during which water will drain from it, then treat it with all that has been mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterizing Diarrhea.
If diarrhea is caused by cold and moisture, which weaken the forces of retention and digestion in the stomach and intestines, and if it has been treated with various methods without recovery, and you see that the patient can withstand cauterization and has abundant strength, cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach. As mentioned earlier for cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery and four gentle cauterizations around the navel using a fine spiral cautery, apply one large or two cauterizations on the cotton above the buttocks.
If you see that the moisture is abundant and the patient can withstand it, cauterize him with one cautery on each thigh fold, one on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations near the large one on the stomach. This treatment is effective and its benefit should not be missed, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Regarding hemorrhoids of the rectum.
If there are chronic hemorrhoids in the rectum, whether numerous or singular, and they are of thick, cold mixtures or corrupt humors, and if treatment according to what was mentioned in the classification has been ineffective, then apply three cauterizations on the lower part of the spinal cord, slightly below the table (a reference to a specific anatomical landmark), in a triangular pattern.
Apply a cauterization two fingerbreadths below the navel. If you determine that his stomach has become cold and that his food is not digesting, and if you observe his face as swollen, then apply a large cauterization on the stomach as previously described, and also apply a cauterization on his liver. Apply another cauterization on his spleen using a spiral cautery. Leave the cauterization open for some time, then treat him until he is cured, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
Regarding cauterization of warts.
After cutting it, if the wart has been cut, heat the cautery that resembles a needle and insert it while hot into the same cut wart. Proceed carefully until the cautery reaches the opening of the sweat gland from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, apply one cauterization to each as described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. If you cauterize it larger on a piece of cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
关于发生在臀部及其周围的瘘管的情况。
如果病人对所描述的切开和治疗过程感到害怕而拒绝执行，或许可以通过烧烙疗法使其康复。当一个人患有瘘管并且脓液和其他腐败液体从中流出时，首先你应该用一根细探针来测量它。
然后，用探针了解瘘管的深度，接着加热一个类似铲形的烙铁，将其插入瘘管中，插入的深度应与探针测量的一致，并沿着瘘管的深度进行烧烙，直到所有腐败物质都被烧尽，根据需要可能需要重复一到三次。
要注意不要烧伤神经，如果有神经存在的话，也不要烧伤大的腺体。如果瘘管通向膀胱或肠道的器官也要小心。
要小心所有这些部位，如果瘘管位于肉厚且你觉得不易穿透的地方，则应进行治疗直到伤口愈合。如果伤口封闭并且没有分泌物排出，并保持这种状态一段时间，那么你可以知道它已经完全康复。
如果没有停止分泌物，那么你可以知道它仍然穿透或者其深处有腐败的骨头或其他类似的情况，在相关内容的位置会有进一步说明。
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
关于烧烙肾脏的方法。
如果肾脏因为寒冷或强烈的风而疼痛，并且导致病人的整体状况下降，那么应该在背部对受影响的肾脏进行烧烙治疗。使用之前提到的类似螺丝刀形状的烙铁，在每侧肾脏各烧烙一次，有时甚至在同一张桌子上进行第三次烧烙，这样总共三次烧烙会排列在一起，效果更佳。
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On the Treatment of Bladder Stones.
If the bladder becomes weak and relaxed due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, cauterize it with cautery at the lower part of the navel near the bladder, where pubic hair begins. Cauterize also on the right side of the navel and on the left side.
After the cauterization from each side, it should be done to the extent of the width of a thumb joint. Cauterize once at the lower back or twice if necessary. The cautery tool should be needle-like as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On the Cauterization of the Uterus.
If cold and humidity cause a substance in the uterus that prevents conception, corrupts the fetus, or causes pain during its emergence, it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel as described for the cauterization of the bladder. Cauterize once at the base of the spine on the cotton or twice if necessary, and the cautery tool should be needle-like.
Chapter Forty.
On the Cauterization for Dislocated Hip.
Humid phlegm can lead to a dislocation of the hip joint, causing one leg to become longer than the other when compared. If you find an empty space indicating the dislocation, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area around the hip itself with a semi-circular cautery.
After learning with ink around the truth as it rotates so that the same truth falls in the center of the circle, then if this iron is not available to you, cauterize three times with a large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization depth according to the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-One.
On Cauterizing for Sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint and its cause is cold and humidity, and treating the patient with what was mentioned in the classification of treatments does not improve the condition and persists, it is necessary to facilitate for the patient by using foul-smelling herbs or prickly lettuce and similar substances.
Then cauterize him, and the cauterization should be in two ways: either by using caustic drugs or by fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize on the hip joint itself three triangular cauteries as shown in this illustration.
Make the depth suitable for them, and the distance between each cauterization should be equal to the thickness of a finger. The cautery should be olive-shaped. You may also cauterize one cauterization in the center on top of the hip joint itself, making four cauteries in total. If you wish, you can use the circular method mentioned earlier for dislocated hips and perform one cauterization.
The circle should encompass the entire hip and burn through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is fixed to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, burn two cauteries on the thigh at the place where the patient points out as painful; one cauterization above the heelbone by four fingers towards the lateral side slightly. The cautery should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only as thick as the skin.
If he points out that the pain extends towards his toes, burn three or four or more dots where he indicates with a cautery. If he points to the pain below the knee towards the leg, burn one knife-shaped cauterization there.
Be careful in all cauterizations that the cautery does not reach a nerve or large artery, as this could cause a serious harm or long-term illness to the patient.
I have seen one and two cases where cauterization was performed above the heelbone and overcautery led to severe swelling in the leg, extending down to the foot, perforating it entirely, and ruining the entire limb. Diarrhea and death followed thereafter. If the pain is on both sides, I would cauterize them in this exact manner.
Some scholars among the philosophers mentioned that for cauterizing the hip, a cautery of this description should be made: fashion something like a cup from iron, with its diameter being half a palm width, and at its mouth it should be as thick as a date pit or slightly less. Inside that cup there is another cup, and a third one inside that.
The space between each cup should be the width of a thumb joint, and the cups should be open on both sides. Their height should be about one or two joints. A handle made of iron should be firmly attached to the cups, and this is its shape.
Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red and sparks fly, then it is placed on the right hip and the patient lies on their healthy side. It should be cauterized with three circular burns at once, then leave it for three days and dress it with grease, leaving the wound open for several days.
It is rarely used because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because few are found who can endure it; however, it is one of the excellent types of cauterization for those who can endure it and whose condition warrants it.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, it is done by making two cups resembling the sockets into which door hinges fit, made of copper or iron.
There should be a height of about two fingers or so around each one, and the distance between them should be the width of a finger. They should be open at the bottom and open at the top, and they should be held together in this manner.
Then place them on the right hip with the patient lying on their healthy side. Keep your hand well wrapped, then pour a little hot water that has been heated in the fire between the two circles. Hold it for about one hour as measured by an hourglass. The patient must endure its stinging and burning, for they will feel a sting like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then lift your hand from the tool and wipe all the affected area with fresh water. Then leave it for three days and apply grease to it until the blackness of the burn fades away. Leave it for several days so that pus can drain out; this is more effective in healing.
Then treat it with ointments until he recovers. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a splint for him as you did for the hip, similarly keeping water out. This is the description of the sharp water and I have established it in the article on preparing medicines.
Take one part each of frying salt and unslaked lime, crush them, and place them in a new pot which you have pierced with a single small hole at the bottom, according to the size of the amount that can enter through it. Place another glazed pot under the bottom of the pot.
Pour fresh water over the salt and lime to cover them by one finger, after kneading them well with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drips into the glazed pot below. Then collect all this water and pour it over another portion of lime and salt that have been renewed as well.
It will then be very sharp and effective for many medical tasks and for cauterizing other parts, as it acts like fire itself. There are also medicines used for cauterizing the hip, such as thapsia, bladder syrup, and lime with soap, which are boiled together.
Galen tells a story about an ancient man who had a remedy for hip pain and sciatica, and he highly praised it, claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures in one application.
Indeed, it is said that a person might enter the bathhouse carried and leave cured. This remedy involves taking green silphium; if not available, dry recent silphium can be used. Crush it finely with some fat and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or on the leg or thigh.
And it should be tightened and left for three hours or as long as the patient feels that the burning has stopped, then take him to the bathhouse. When his body is drenched with sweat, put him in the pool; the pain will disappear and he will be healed by God's permission. If he does not heal, redo the dressing on him after ten days once again.
He will be healed, if God wills. And know that one should not use cauterization with these medicines until the body has been purged. Dioscorides mentioned that the sweat of a goat, when used for cauterization on sciatica, is beneficial.
Cauterization should be performed in this manner: Take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep spot between the thumb and the joint of the hand, closer to the joint. Then take dry sweat from a goat.
Set it alight with fire until it becomes an ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another one; continue doing this until the sensation reaches halfway between the shoulder and the hip. The pain will be relieved by God's permission. This type of cauterization is called caprine cauterization.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Cauterizing Back Pain.
Pain in the back may occur due to many reasons, such as a fall or a blow or excessive purging and similar causes. It is caused by the accumulation of cold and moist substances, and cauterization is applied specifically to this type.
Whoever suffers from the effusion of cold matter should, after inducing vomiting with rotten fruit and similar substances, cauterize his back at the site of pain in three rows as wide as a table, applying five or more cauteries in each row according to what the patient can tolerate and his strength.
The cauterization should be done with a puncture iron. If you prefer, you can perform it with three or four cauteries using a medium-sized nail iron in this manner.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterizing the Initial Stage of a Hunchback.
This condition often occurs in young children, and its initial sign is that the child experiences shortness of breath when standing or moving. You will find a protruding vertebra at the end of the spine that stands out compared to the other vertebrae.
If you observe this and wish to prevent its progression, cauterize it with an iron in the shape of a circle as shown in this illustration. Cauterize the vertebra evenly on all sides. If you prefer, you can perform it around the vertebra using a puncture iron in two or three rows, with the punctures close to each other. Then treat the area until it heals as mentioned.
Be cautious not to use cauterization in a hunchback caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On Cauterizing Gout and Joint Pains.
If the pains in the joints are due to cold humidities that settle in any part of the body, and if these pains occur in the legs, it is the custom of physicians to call this gout.
If the cold gout is treated with various treatments that we have mentioned in the classification and the pains do not subside, then cauterization will remove them. This involves cauterizing around the knee joints after vomiting, using many cauteries. The cautery should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, as shown in this illustration.
If it is necessary to puncture the face of the foot, do so with a puncturing cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, which often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from each side using this olive-shaped cautery.
If more cauterization is needed, proceed with it, but do not go deep with the cautery; it should only be as thick as the skin. If the pains ascend to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods mentioned in that section.
If the pains are in the hands only, puncture around the wrists in two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, puncture each joint with a point and on the heel of the hand. If the pains ascend to the elbows or shoulders after days, proceed accordingly.
Cauterize them from each side, and do not neglect proper care and taking medicine. If the patient improves their diet and expels phlegm, they will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
في خياطة الفتحات.
إذا ظهر فتق في الأربية وانحدرت بعض أجزاء المعاء والثرب إلى الخصية وكان الفتق مبتدئاً قريباً، فينبغي أن تأمر المريض بترك الأكل لمدة يوم وأن يستخدم من الملينات ما يساعد على إخراج البراز من جوفه.
ثم يضطجع بين يديك على ظهره وتأمره أن يمسك نفسه حتى يبرز الثرب أو المعاء، ثم تردده بأصبعك. ثم تعلم بالمداد تحت الفتق على عظم العانة علامة تشبه نصف الدائرة أطرافها إلى أعلى البدن.
ثم تحمى مكواة، وهذه صورتها.
حتى تCOME WHITE وتخلو من الشرر، ثم ترد المعاء أو الثرب إلى جوفه. ثم يضع خادم يده على الموضع لئلا يبرز المعاء، وقد فرجت بين ساقى المريض ووضعت تحته وسادة، وخادم آخر يربط ساقيه.
وثالث على صدره يمسك يديه، ثم تنزل المكواة على العلامة نفسها. وتضرب بالمكواة واقفة مستقيمة، وتمسكها حتى تبلغ بها العظم أو تعدها مرة أخرى إن لم تبلغ بالأولى إلى العظم.
وتحفظ جهدك من بروز المعاء في حين خياطتك لئلا تحرقه فيحدث بذلك للمريض إما الموت وإما بلية عظمى. واعلم أنك متى لم تبلغ بالخياطة العظم لم ينجح عملك، ويجب أن تكون مكواة الصبيان لطيفة على أقدارهم وللكبار على أقدارهم.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with fat until the redness of the fire subsides, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is completely healed.
It is advisable to make his diet during the treatment such that it softens his stomach so that the intestines do not protrude when defecating. Then, if he wants to stand up after forty days, use a firm bandage and keep him bound for another forty days, and reduce his exertion and fullness from food and drink and loud shouting.
If this treatment is followed as described, he will be completely healed, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its proper section, God willing. As for a hernia that occurs in other parts of the abdomen and is recent, if you wish it not to worsen, apply cautery in the form of a circle according to its size from the hernia. Burn a portion of the skin, about one-third, then treat it as mentioned. It will not worsen, God willing. Some early practitioners have suggested using a triangular cautery on the hernia in this manner.
After treating the hernia with collyrium, draw a line across at the top of the hernia and another line downwards. Place your hand in the middle and apply one cautery in the shape of a nail. The first method is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On Cautering Hydrocele.
If there is pain in some organs due to a fall or a blow, and the pain persists for a long time without medicine being effective, it should be cauterized with a cautery point. The burning of each organ should be according to its size, whether large or small, and according to its weakness or strength.
If the pain persists despite the initial cauterization, repeat the cauterization because it is characteristic of such pains to move to adjacent organs. Therefore, follow them with cauterization until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
Leprosy patients can greatly benefit from cauterization, especially those whose condition is due to the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize a leprosy patient, examine them. If the leprosy is in its initial stage and has not improved with the treatments mentioned in the classification, and if there is fear that the disease might spread throughout their constitution, then cauterize the head with five applications. The first one in the middle of the head, the second below it near the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind on the nape of the neck. Cauterize deeply so that it slightly affects the bone.
Scabs will fall off, making it easier for thick vapors to escape. Cauterize him again in the same manner as described for the spleen. If leprosy persists and becomes clearly visible, cauterize the areas on the head as mentioned earlier. A cautery mark at the tip of the nose and two on each cheek, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, one large one at the coccyx at the base of the tailbone and another above it in the same region, and two on the hipbones, one on each side. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the ribs of the chest, and a cautery mark on every joint of his fingers and toes, and one on the heel of each foot and one on each wrist.
Be cautious of the nerve at the back of the heels to avoid burning it. A cautery mark may be applied on the pubic bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more you apply cauteries, the more effective they are.
Know that the sick person does not feel pain from cautery as a healthy person would, because his body is numb. The cauteries should be made with large or small instruments according to the organs and joints, as previously described for the characteristics of the tools.
Then treat the cautery with flour of barley mixed with honey and continue other treatments until he is healed, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On Cauterizing Numbness: If a part of the body becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings but does not heal, then cauterize the numb part with cautery marks according to what the bone or joint deserves in size. Make your cautery deeper into the thickness of the skin slightly.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals, and for some numbness that occurs in the hand or foot near the vertebrae of the spine where the nerve that moves that limb exits, cauterization may be applied to alleviate the numbness.
And he should not proceed with that except for one who is well-versed in the anatomy of organs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Vitiligo.
If vitiligo persists and no medical remedy proves effective, cauterize it slightly to a depth equal to the thickness of the skin, so that the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with flour of lentils mixed with rose oil, rue leaves, the tongue of a pregnant hen, and the blood of a pigeon or sparrow, using one part of each. Mix all together and apply to a bandage which is then applied to the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On Cauterizing Cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop its progression, cauterize it with a circular iron around it as it rotates. Some wise men have mentioned that it should be cauterized deeply in the center, but I do not see this as advisable because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed this happen several times.
The proper method is to cauterize around it in a circle as we have said, or with many small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
In Treating Hernias.
If a hernia occurs and it delays in maturing, either due to the active quality that causes it, or due to the age of the patient if he is an elderly person with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the hernia, then apply numerous small cauterizations around it, dotting them.
Then leave it, for it will mature more quickly. If you wish to treat it with cauterization, heat the cautery, which has this shape.
Place it in the center of the hernia until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from below to facilitate the flow of pus, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
In Cauterizing Ulcers.
An ulcer is a corruption that spreads within the organ, eating it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place where cauterization with fire is possible, heat many cautery irons of various sizes—small and large—as appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is completely removed and nothing remains. Then leave it for three days, and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scabs and corruption fall off entirely.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If, after three days, you see that the flesh is growing properly without any corruption, proceed otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupt areas. The ulcer can also be treated with a potent medication.
For it takes the place of fire more quickly and effectively. I have mentioned its treatment with a sharp medicine in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On Heating Reverse and Non-Reverse Nails.
This condition often occurs on the soles of the feet; it is rough and causes pain. Heating to treat it can be done in two ways: either by fire or by boiling water.
As for heating with fire, it involves heating a hollow iron tool resembling an eagle's feather, which is made to fit around the nail on all sides and has thin edges. Then place the heated tool onto the nail and rotate your hand around the nail with the tool until it reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days until pus forms, then dress it with crushed wild barley mixed with salt. Leave the dressing on overnight; the nail will come out from its root. Then treat the wound site with a healing ointment until it heals. If the nails are not reversed.
This often occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet. You should take a tube made of copper or iron or an eagle's feather and place it over the nail or growth, then pour some boiling water into the tube.
Hold the tube with your hand and rotate it while gently pressing to ensure the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail. The boiling water will find its way to reach the depth of the nail. The patient should忍耐一会儿沸水的刺痛。
Then leave it, for the nail will come off with its root. Do this one by one until you have dealt with all of them in the body, then treat their places after they are removed with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On Scorching the Sponge.
If one of the sponge carriers is affected by cold in the nerve or by a quarter fever or something else, it is necessary to scorch him four or five times on the acupuncture points on the back, with a scorching at each point, and also scorch once on his chest. And scorch his stomach with an olive oil heated iron, for the sponge carrier will be relieved and the cold illness will quickly mature.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Scorching Boils That Occur in the Body.
Boils may appear in the body due to thick, corrupt cold substances. At their first appearance, it is necessary to scorch each boil gently with a burning end of an ash branch or with the root of a long rue stem or with a lentil-shaped iron on top of the boil.
Veins that become inflamed at their initial onset can also be scorcheded in this manner, so they do not increase and the causative factor causing them dissipates, leading to the patient's recovery. However, it should be done after letting blood from the patient.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On severe bleeding from cutting the artery.
Severe bleeding often occurs when an artery is cut during a wound that has been exposed from the outside, or when incising a tumor or organ and the like; it is difficult to control.
If such a situation occurs, quickly place your thumb on the mouth of the artery and press firmly so that the blood is confined under your finger and does not escape. Then heat olive oil cauterizing irons of various sizes in the fire until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and the location where the artery has burst. Place the iron on the same vein immediately after removing your finger quickly, holding the iron until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding continues when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and before using the iron, quickly take another iron from those in the prepared fire and continue doing so with one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that may be nearby, as this would cause additional harm to the patient. Know that if blood flows from an artery, it cannot be cut except by one of four methods: cauterization as we have described, or amputation if it has not already been done. If it is amputated, the ends will contract and the bleeding will stop. Alternatively, it can be tightly ligatured with threads, or medications that cause hemostasis can be applied and firmly bandaged to stop the bleeding.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a ligature or by binding with cloth or applying burning substances and the like, it will not be severed by that at all except in rare cases. If any of this happens to someone and there is no doctor or medicine present, then he should immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself as we have described.
It should be tightly bound until the blood is constricted and flows only above the wound and on the artery. The finger should not be removed by cold water continuously until the blood coagulates, thickens, and stops. During this time, observe what may be needed for cauterization or medication.
The Second Chapter.
On Incisions, Slit Incisions, Venesection, and Wounds and the Like.
Khallaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease that can be treated with cauterization by fire and burning medicines, along with their causes and reasons, instruments, and forms of cautery. We arranged them as sections from the heel to the head.
And I will follow the same approach in this chapter so that it is easy for the student to attain what he seeks.
Before I begin with this, it is necessary for you to know, O sons, that this chapter contains more precious information than what is in the first chapter regarding cauterization.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the warning be stronger because the work in this chapter involves a lot of bloodletting from the blood upon which life depends when opening a vein or making an incision on a swelling or draining an abscess or treating a wound or extracting an arrow or cutting for a stone and similar procedures, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and often result in death.
I warn you against falling into what is doubtful. For different kinds of people will come to you in this profession with various illnesses; some of them are tired of their illness and find death easy.
Due to the severity of his illness and the length of his suffering, and because the disease has taken such a form that it indicates death, there are others who will offer you money in hope of recovery, though their disease is fatal. Therefore, you should not assist those who come to you with this kind of situation at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything unless you are certain of the knowledge about what will result in a desirable outcome. Use foresight and warning regarding all treatments to ensure safety for your patients.
For in that you will find assistance in acquiring praise, glory, remembrance, and commendation. May God grant you wisdom, my sons, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His hands; there is no god but He.
I have organized this chapter into sections as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, from the heel to the head, to make it easier for you to find what you seek, if God wills.
The First Section.
On the Treatment of Water That Accumulates in the Heads of Children.
This illness often occurs in children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head too roughly. It can also occur due to an unknown hidden condition.
I have not seen this condition in anyone except children, and all whom I have seen suffered a quicker approach to death. Therefore, I have seen fit to refrain from treating it. Indeed, I saw a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grows larger every day. The child could not even sit due to the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
This moisture either accumulates between the skin and the bone, or beneath the bone on the membrane. If the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, it should be necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head horizontally, about two fingers long, so that the moisture can drain out. This is what the scalpel looks like.
If the moisture is more abundant and the swelling is larger, make two intersecting incisions as shown in this figure:.
If the moisture is beneath the bone, its sign is that you will see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and when you squeeze it with your hand, the water descends inward. You should then make three incisions in the middle of the head as shown in this figure:.
After the incision, all the moisture should be removed. Then, close the cuts with bandages and dressings. Cover it from above with drinks and oil until the fifth day, then loosen the bindings and treat the wound with linen strips and ointments. Do not keep the head tightly bound; feed the patient dry food with little moisture.
Until the organ strengthens and heals. Another method for incision is to observe where the bone of the swelling and accumulation of water are most apparent, as it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Cut where the tumor and fluid accumulation are apparent, and cut as much as you can, but be careful not to cut an artery, for if you do, bleeding may occur, causing the patient to die from that hemorrhage despite the expulsion of moisture.
الفرع الثاني.
Cut the two arteries behind the known ears called the temporal arteries.
When a person suffers from a sudden severe attack affecting the eyes or the chest, and medication fails to provide relief, then the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
When you wish to cut them, shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to make the artery visible. Then tie the patient’s neck with the edge of their garment. Look for where the pulse beats; it is in the two lower positions behind the ears, which are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, and cut them with a sharp scalpel down to the bone; the width of the cut should be about the breadth of the head. If you prefer, insert the scalpel underneath the artery and cut upwards, the length of the cut being approximately two closed fingers.
When the artery is cut, blood will gush out in pulsating spurts. If the artery does not become visible to the touch, estimate three finger breadths from the ear and mark it with ink, then cut down to the bone. It is important that...
The bleeding should continue for six watches (approximately six hours) on average, though it may be more or less depending on the patient's strength and fullness of the arteries. Then examine the wound; if any part of the peritoneum remains attached to the bone, cut it away.
To prevent inflammation, bind the wound with a thread from linen cloth and then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Cut the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic sinusitis or acute attacks caused by noxious humidity and heat in the temple muscles, or severe chronic headaches, and various medical treatments have been ineffective, we have found that cutting or cauterizing the arteries in the temples, as described, can be effective for these conditions.
The procedure for cutting them involves shaving the hair from the temples, and then identifying the visible artery in the temple, as its pulse is usually apparent and it rarely goes unnoticed except in rare cases.
Or, if the weather is extremely cold and it is difficult to locate the artery, the patient should tighten their neck with a piece of cloth, and you should rub the area with a cloth or apply hot water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the scalpel whose image is shown here. Then gently cut the skin with it until you reach the artery, then insert a needle into it and pull it up to remove it from the skin, freeing it from the fascia beneath it on all sides. If the artery is thin, loop it with the tip of the needle. Then cut a portion of it according to the distance between its ends, ensuring that it constricts without causing bleeding. If it is not completely severed and does not stop the flow of blood, the blood will not clot properly. Then let out six to three seers of blood.
If the artery is large, it should be tied at two places with a strong folded thread, and let the thread be either of flax or of horn strips so that corruption does not reach it before the wound has healed, thus causing hemorrhage.
Then cut off the excess between the ligatures; do this at that time or later. If you wish to cauterize it with a cautery heated by a knife until its ends are consumed, it will serve as well or better, as we have said.
Except if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization helps to consume moisture and is more beneficial. After tying off the arteries, the place should be stuffed with old lint and covered with secure bandages. After untying them, treat with drying medicines that promote flesh growth and use bandaging until he is healed, if God wills.
If bleeding occurs from the artery during your work, immediately cut it off either by cauterization or fill the place with a plug and press firmly until the blood stops. If neither of these is available to you, place your finger on it until the blood clots.
Cool the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and then secure it as necessary. A less severe and easier method than tying off the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-edged cautery after applying medicine to the area.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is cut in two places to separate its ends, as it will not heal with this cauterization at all. This is a picture of the cautery.
It should be as sharp as two small spoons, but much less sharp than a knife, for if it were as sharp as a knife, cold would reach them more quickly and flesh would not separate quickly. If there is some thickness in them, the heat of fire will cling to them.
Cut through the flesh quickly; this work is better than all others, lighter and easier, and let there be between the two blades a thickness equal to that of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the treatment of continuous hot tears flowing to the eyes.
If the tears are continuous and their flow is from the veins on the skull's exterior, and no benefit is derived from medicinal treatments, and you observe that the patient's face has turned red. There is a sensation on his forehead like the movement of ants, and his eyes are sunken and watery, with their lashes weakened from the intensity of the tears. Therefore, they resort to this treatment, which is called treatment with the sword, and it involves ordering the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead along its length. Each incision is about two finger breadths long; one in the middle of the forehead parallel to the length of the nose, the second a little away from the movement of the muscle near the temple, and the third on the opposite side.
Be cautious not to cut the two arteries on the sides and keep your hand away from where the jaws meet. There should be a distance of about three clenched fingers between each incision. Have pieces of sponge prepared or a dry cloth at hand to stop the bleeding.
Then insert the sharp two-ended scalpel whose shape is as follows. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and peel off all the skin between the two incisions along with the subcutaneous tissue on the bone; then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, then remove this scalpel. And insert another tool into the first incision, called a sharp knife on one side and smooth without a blade on the other side; this is its shape:.
And direct its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; push it until it reaches the middle incision and cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without cutting through to the outer surface of the skin.
Then do the same for the middle incision to the other side; after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, press the areas where the clotted blood is cut; then in each incision place a wick made of boiled cotton and put on it a poultice soaked in a mixture of syrup, oil, or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling; on the third day, remove the bandage and use plenty of warm water baths, then treat it with a salve of basilicon with rose oil, and other treatments used for wounds until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On the Treatment of Tears and Discharges to the Eyes from Inside the Head.
When a person experiences frequent, severe, hot discharges to the eyes that are continuous, and you notice the eyes becoming sunken, smaller, with weakened vision, the eyelids become ulcerated, and the eyelashes fall out. There will be a sharp and painful pain in the head's depth, and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those substances and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is to order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
There will be a sharp and painful pain in the head's depth, and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those substances and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is to order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or raise it slightly in width and start the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and make the incision to the bone, keeping your hand away from the moving temples' muscles when chewing until the bone is exposed and all the blood is cleaned with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or a bandage made of linen, and secure it from above with dressings. Soak the dressings in liquid and oil to prevent a hot swelling. When you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone so that flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony to prepare an ointment, which is used for the growth of flesh in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
On the Treatment of What Falls into the Ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or something like a stone such as iron and glass; or plant seeds like chickpeas, pits, and the like; or a liquid substance such as water, vinegar, and similar items.
And if it is an animal [stone], when a stone falls into the ear or something like a stone that does not exceed in size within the ear, then turn the ear towards the sun. If you see the stone, drip some oil of violet or serge into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with condys. Plug the nostrils when sneezing after placing a bandage or wool around the ear and extend the ear upwards. Often, this treatment helps to remove it; if not, then try to remove it with thin wax, which is shown in this illustration.
If it comes out with the wax, otherwise try to remove it with a delicate hook with little bends. If that does not work, then make a tube of copper and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole carefully.
Plug around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil so that there is no other way for air except through the tube. Then draw it out strongly with your breath; often, this will work. If not, take some Arab gum or prepared birdlime in small quantity and place it at the tip of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then gently insert it into the ear hole after drying the ear of moisture. If it does not come out despite all the methods described, proceed to make an incision before a hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The incision method is as follows: First, let blood from the patient in a cupping vessel according to their strength. Then seat the patient between your hands and turn their ear upwards. Make a small cut at the base of the ear near its cartilage in the lower part.
The incision should be made in a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, then remove it with whatever instrument is available to you. Then sew up the incision as quickly as possible and treat it until it heals.
And if the object that has fallen into the ear is one of those seeds that swell and become inflamed, try to remove it using the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate blade in this shape.
Try to cut that type of seed fallen in the ear with it. Do this only if you are certain that the seed has become softened by the moisture of the ear, making it break into many small pieces, then remove them with a hook, a delicate probe, or by suction.
As mentioned, it becomes easier to remove them. As for water that has entered the ear, it is advisable for the patient to sneeze using pepper first while lying down with some old cotton plugged in the affected ear. If this method works, the water will be expelled.
If not, take many thin, smooth pebbles and warm them slightly over fire. The patient should then insert one of these stones into the ear canal while hopping on one leg, and strike another stone against the one in the ear.
He should continue doing this with each stone until all the water is expelled. Alternatively, take a piece of linen or a feather, insert one end into the ear, and hold the other end over fire until it burns mostly away, then replace it with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water is removed, or use a tube as described for removing a stone. As for extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the division [of cases] and so on.
If its body is large and visible to the senses, try to extract it using cotton and tweezers; this procedure is easier than dealing with any issue in the ear. As for extracting worms that have developed in the ear if you treat it as mentioned in the division of cases in the chapter on tumors and your treatment does not succeed,
You should look into the ear towards the sun; if you see any worms, remove them with cotton or fine tweezers. If you do not see anything, take this tube which has the following shape.
It is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it; do this repeatedly until all the worms are removed. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax as mentioned for removing a stone.
If they do not come out with the methods mentioned, use cauterization as I have described; it has been tried by earlier practitioners to kill the worms. You will find this in the chapter on cauterization. Your application of oils and medicines into the ear can be done using this device, which has the following shape:
As you can see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, the tube inside the device can be made of solid copper. Alternatively, you may take a wick, wind cotton around one end tightly.
Then pour the oil or juice or any other desired medicine into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert a wick made of cotton from above and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil flows into the inner ear and you feel it.
Have the patient enter, and make sure what you pour into the ear is slightly warmed in fire. Beware that what you drop into it is not too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On the Treatment of Obstructive Conditions of the Ear.
Some children are born with their ear canals not perforated.
It may also occur that some people have an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or flesh growth, and this obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, beyond the reach of sight.
It may also be partially exposed outside the ear canal and within sight. That which is deep within the ear and not visible is usually difficult to remove, while that which can be seen should have the patient's ear placed in sunlight. Examine it; if you see the obstruction clearly, then open it with a delicate scalpel. This is how it should appear:.
Its tip should be slightly broad and its sides smooth to avoid harming the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it gently with a fine forceps and cut it carefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the plug is deep in the ear, take a thin, smooth probe and warm it slightly over fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the plug and the patient feels the heaviness of hearing, gently push it aside.
Be careful not to injure the nerve of the ear, then place a thread in the ear according to the size of the hole, wrap it with Egyptian ointment; do this for days until you are safe from the wound healing over. Or take a thread, moisten it with water and sprinkle it with powdered antimony.
Use it, and if you see the ear swell with a hot swelling, then remove the thread and replace it with another thread wrapped in keratin ointment made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then continue treating it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatments that stop the mentioned bleeding as described in the article on hemostasis.
Chapter Eight.
On the Treatment of Warts That Appear on the Eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry; it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or a clamp and cut them at the root with scissors, then apply powdered antimony to the area.
If bleeding occurs from them, treat it with a gentle convex iron; applying the iron after cutting is better. Often they return if any of the root remains, but if you burn it with fire, it will destroy that root and will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the Treatment of Temporary Catarrh in the Nasal Passages.
It often happens that something resembling severe and persistent catarrh appears in the nasal passages.
And for this reason, it is called catarrh, which is the accumulation of thick moisture in both the upper and lower eyelids. The procedure here is to observe; if the condition appears prominently on the surface of the eyelid and can move freely in all directions, then the task is easy, and you should proceed by applying pressure to it gently.
Then carefully peel it away from all sides until it is completely loosened, then lift it out with forceps and cut it off. If you cannot cut it immediately without piercing the eyelid, doing so will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, stitch it up and treat it until it heals.
If the condition is small, there is no need to worry about it; ointment will heal and seal it. If the catarrh is inclined towards the inner surface of the eyelid, flip the eyelid over and lift the catarrh with forceps without needing an incision, then remove it from all sides.
If you pierce the eyelid in the process, it will not harm the patient. Then wash the eye with salt water after removing the catarrh, and treat the area to promote healing until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On the Treatment of Sties That Appear in the Eyelid.
The sharnaq is a growth that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it affects boys more often. It burdens their eyes and they are prone to nighttime coughing fits and are unable to look at the light of the sun. Because tears hasten towards them.
That is why you often see them leaning on their faces and sleeping in that position; their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, with puffiness and the marks of the sharnaq clearly visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the sharnaq between them. The method of treatment involves having the patient place his head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen and prepare a wick from it, and make a circle with that wick around the sharnaq on all sides. Then place it over the area and press it with your fingers from all sides to gather the sharnaq in the center of the circle.
Then make a horizontal incision in the center of that moist area with a sharp scalpel, and the incision should not be larger than the one made in bloodletting. As for the depth, it is necessary to cut through the entire skin until you reach the sharnaq.
In most cases, the sharnaq will protrude from the incision in the form of a white fatty piece. You should pull it out with a linen strip you have rolled between your fingers to the outside while rotating your hand left and right until it is completely removed. Be careful not to extend the incision too much so that the scalpel does not injure the eye.
If the sharnaq does not appear at the beginning of the incision, you should gently extend it a little until the sharnaq becomes visible. Then pull it out as previously described. Afterwards, dip a piece of cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area, securing it gently with a bandage. Some people crush salt for this purpose.
He places it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture, then treats it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, he treats it with poultices that reduce inflammation until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On Methods of Eyebrow Grooming.
If extra eyelashes grow outside the natural course underneath the normal eyelashes and persist, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyelids, whitening, thickening, until it leads to impairment of the vision.
Eyebrow grooming is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or by using a sharp medication as previously mentioned in the section on cauterization, or it can be done by cutting and sewing, or with reeds as I will mention.
Place the patient's head in your lap, then flip the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not flip, insert a needle with thread from beneath the eyelid and pass the needle through the thread from above, near the hairline itself, and pull the thread up with the eyelid.
Flip it with a probe, then make an incision inside the eyelid, below the extra hair, from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus. Then pass the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and secure the eyelid with adhesive.
Like the shape of an oak leaf, but it should be sized according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, as people's needs differ. Some may need a portion of the eyelid to be cut in proportion to how droopy the eyelid is.
And there are those who need to cut less of all that, according to the laxity of the eyelid, then incise with the scalpel along the two lines you have been taught, starting from the greater commissure to the lesser commissure, and each incision should be near the natural hairline at about the thickness of a thread.
Then insert the spatula into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off, then stitch together the two lips with a fine needle and thread. Clean the blood and secure any remaining threads above the eyebrows with some adhesive if necessary.
Do as you wish to do it, or else you may leave it be. Then let the stitches remain for about three or four days, then treat it; if you prefer, you can leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound closes together. Stitching is better however.
This aspect of suturing was mentioned by earlier practitioners, except that it places a burden on the patient; however, it is good work and carries no risk. Another aspect of suturing is to shape the eyelid like the form of an iris leaf as described. Then raise the eyelid with three spatulas that may be spread apart or gathered together in this manner:.
Then cut off any excess of the eyelid with a small scissors in this manner evenly:.
If you cannot hold the spatulas in place and they do not stand firm, take a needle with thread and insert it at the center of the shape. Insert another thread near the greater commissure and a third thread near the lesser commissure. Gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then lift them with a moderate pull.
Raise the entire prepared skin flap as we described, then stitch together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, apply a plaster like the qirwat and similar soothing ointments to alleviate that swelling.
It may also happen to the lower eyelid that its lashes turn inward, in which case you should use what we mentioned about cutting, stitching, and using cautery with fire or a sharp medicine. Using cautery with fire or a sharp medicine is more effective and less burdensome on the patient than cutting and stitching; cutting and stitching are better for these cases.
Cauterization with reed is done in this manner: Turn the eyelid inside out and make an incision as described from the inner part, then prepare two thin pieces of reed or wood whose length matches that of the eyelid and width less than that of a scalpel blade.
Make small incisions at the ends of both sides where the stitches will be placed, then gently bring together the remaining parts of the eyelid. Tighten the two pieces of reed or wood securely on both sides and leave it for several days. The tightened skin will die, turn black, and decay.
Until it falls off on its own; if it delays, cut it with a scalpel and treat it until it heals. Once it has healed, the eyelid will rise and the lashes will no longer touch the eye. This is an image of the reeds that should be made in this shape and exact measurement for length and width:
The Twelfth Chapter.
On Removing Eyelashes That Irritate the Eye Using a Needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle and pass through it a thin smooth silk thread, then gather its ends and tie them with a very delicate knot; let the length of the thread be about an inch.
Then, place another thin thread under the first one, shorter than it, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient rest his head in your lap, preferably near a source of sunlight so that the work can be seen clearly, for it is delicate. Then insert the needle with the thread at the base of the extra hair.
Then pass the needle quickly through the eyelid until it emerges above the natural hair, then pull the thread over the knot and insert the thread into the knot if there is one, two, or at most three hairs.
Then pull with your hand until the hair comes out with the knot along with the natural hair from the eyelid. If you pull the knot and the hair does not come out with it, pull the knot down with the thread that you placed in it until the knot comes out of the upper hole.
Then replace the hair in it and pull them both; do this until you see the hair with your own eyes at the upper hole. At that moment, release the knot and thread and remove them, then tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows around it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer hair from the natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after some time, then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
في علاج الشرطة التي تحدث في الجفن الأعلى للعين.
التي تتعرض لها هذه الشرطة تسمى أرنبية، وتكون هذه الشرطة إما طبيعية وإما عرضية. فالعربية تكون من اندمل جرح أو شق أو كيٍّ أو نحو ذلك.
ووجه العمل فيها أن تشق ذلك الاندمال وأن تفرقي شفتيه وتصير فيما بينهما فتيلة من كتان وتربطها حتى تبرأ، ولا ينبغي أن تستعمل في علاجها الأشياء التي تجفف وتقبض.
فإنك إن فعلت ذلك رجعت الشرطة بأشد مما كانت، بل استعمل فيها الأشياء التي ترخي مثل الحلبة والتنطيل بماء قد طبخ فيه خطمي وبزر الكتان ومرهم الدياخيلون قد ذوب مع شىء من الأدهان ولطخت به الفتل وعالجت بها.
وملاك علاجها أن تروم بكل حيلة أن لا تلتحم على الهيئة التي كانت عليها أولًا. وهذا العمل الذي ذكرنا إنما هو بعض إصلاح الشرطة لا أن ترجع هيئة المكان على حسب ما كانت تمامًا،.
Chapter Fourteen.
في علاج الشرطة التي تكون في الجفن السفلي.
هذه الشرطة التي تكون من أسفل هي التي تسمى بالحقيق شطرة، وتكون طبيعية وتكون عرضية. فالعربية تكون من جرح أو شق أو كيٍّ ونحو ذلك.
The method is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left jugular vein to the right jugular vein until the thread is at both ends of the flesh. Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that is sufficient; otherwise, take a probe and place it at the site of the incision, then flip the eyelid with it. Make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, the ends of which should be at the corners of the cut you made, so they meet to form an angle. Until it comes together and takes on a shape similar to this shape:.
It is the Greek letter L, then remove that piece of flesh so that its sharp edge is lower than the eyelid. Then sew together the separated parts with two stitches using wool thread and treat it with the relaxing medicines and bandaging as mentioned until it heals.
And if the scar is wide from an incision, suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without cutting the eyelashes as mentioned previously. Then separate the two edges with bandaging as described.
In summary, the treatment of a scar whether it is above or below should be done according to what you find suitable based on the appearance of the scar. It may vary greatly in shape, and the skilled craftsman will devise a way to manage it as best as possible.
Until the shape is restored to its natural form or comes close to it, and the disease itself will guide you on what treatment and tool is suitable in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion occurs in many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions. It is necessary to insert a probe under the eyelid.
Lift it up or extend it with a pulley, then cut the adhesion with a very sharp scalpel, but not as sharply as when cutting other tissues to avoid disturbing the patient and potentially injuring the eye with its edge. Your cutting should be such that you remove the adhesion as if peeling it away.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural position and the adhesion is completely removed, then pour salty water into the eye to wash it or drop a solution of zanjari medicine diluted in water into it. Then use a cotton swab to separate the eyelid from the eye.
Place a piece of wool soaked in egg white over the eye. Starting on the third day, use ointments until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
Regarding the excision of nail tumors and removal of flesh from interdigital spaces.
A nail tumor can be of two types: either it is neural, resembling a hard, thin swelling, or it is non-neural, similar to solid white moisture that breaks into pieces if touched by iron or pulled with a pulley.
And no clamp is used in this. Both types begin at the maxilla and proceed little by little until they cover the eye and prevent light and movement of the eye, and the way to cut it is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the fingernail with a slightly curved clamp and extend it upwards. Then take a needle and insert a hair from horsehair or oxhair along with strong thread into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce it in the middle of the fingernail.
Then pass it through with the needle and tie the fingernail with thread, extend it upwards, and peel off the side of the fingernail next to the pupil as if you are spreading it out with the hair until the end, then cut the rest at the base of the maxilla with a fine scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the maxilla.
To avoid continuous tearing from cutting it, you can extend the fingernail with the clamp alone or with thread as we said, then peel off the smooth edge which has this shape:.
Be careful that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane to avoid causing a tear and thus injuring the pupil. After cutting, apply some powdered salt or zanjari salve to the eye, then leave it for another day before treating it as necessary until it heals.
If the fingernail is not painful and you cannot insert a needle or clamp into it, this type of fingernail is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth, weak-edged scalpel in this form:. Smooth the nail with it gently from above. If you see that it is loosening and crumbling, and there is an effect in it from smoothing, then drop some of your saffron medication or red medicine or powdered salt into the eye, and leave the eye for another day.
Then, repeat the process until it is all gone, unless a hot tumor appears in the eye, in which case leave it and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then resume smoothing it until it heals. As for the swelling of the flesh of the throat:
If the swelling severely irritates the eye, attach that swelling to a trap and cut some of it, but do not overdo the cutting so as to avoid causing tears, then drop red medicine or saffron medication into the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting wortmannia and what grows as excess flesh in the eye.
Red flesh may grow in the eyes of some people, overlapping until it covers the pupil or comes close to it or overflows onto the eyelids, and the eyelids may turn outward, resembling the rose of gallnut.
The procedure involves the patient placing their head in your lap, then opening their eyes, and you grasp all that red flesh with appropriate forceps.
Or you can hold it with a needle or a probe, then cut the flesh little by little until all of it is removed, being careful not to harm the eye during the procedure. Your cutting should be done either with the scalpel we described for cutting nails or with a small scissors. As you will see its illustration in the following chapter.
When the cutting is complete and all the bleeding has stopped, fill the eye with powdered salt or sprinkle red aloes or similar corrosive drugs. Apply a pad held in place by egg white from the outside to prevent inflammation.
If any bleeding persists and the blood overwhelms you, fearing inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with what soothes the swelling. Then return to work on it until it heals. Do the same for excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by nature or appearance with iron instruments. Do not proceed with these treatments until you are certain that the organ can withstand such work.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Extracting Cataracts from the Eye.
Cataracts are red veins that form on the eye, impeding vision and weakening the eye over time. First, you should examine the eye; if it is strong and there is no other disease besides the cataracts.
Then you should proceed with the extraction. Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, then clamp those veins with one or two forceps according to your skill. The forceps should be delicate and curved as shown in this figure:.
Or they may be double forceps in one body as shown in this figure:.
Then use a fine pair of scissors to extract those veins gently, and wipe the blood from time to time until you see with your own eyes that those veins have been removed and the blood has flowed. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done halfway through the day facing the sun.
And be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those veins. When you finish, drop some healing green or red extract into the eye to cleanse any remaining passages with its sharpness. If you cannot remove everything at that time, dress the eye with something that alleviates the pain.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and you are assured that there is no inflammation. Then repeat this procedure in the same manner until the eye is healed of these symptoms.
Leave it [with the patient's head in the lap of a student and another wiping away the tears, examining the front and back of the eye carefully] and you [the surgeon] should hold the eyelid open with forceps that are either fixed or triangular.
Hold the eyelid taut, with the patient's head in the lap of a student and another wiping away the tears and examining the front and back of the eye. You have the option to start extracting veins from the top of the eye or from the bottom. It is preferable to place two ligatures on the upper side, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at its beginning.
Hold them between your middle and index fingers, then place ligatures underneath corresponding to them. Hold them between your little finger and ring finger, lifting your hand slightly until you see all the passages have risen; then cut from the lesser outer side with scissors or a fine scalpel if necessary.
And insert the needle into the incision and clean all passages until it rises above the gum, but do not cut the nasal passage, for tears and blood will soften it.
Then cut with scissors what exceeds the circumference from above and below, so that nothing remains embedded except in the cornea. If possible, raise it from the cornea using an incision; this is better. It may become necessary for some people.
And when you cut it, the area will be inflamed for days, the pain will subside, and the hot swelling will diminish. Then repeat the procedure on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On Replacing the Septum of the Nose.
The doctors call the septum "nasorus" when they treat it by cauterization or with a harsh, burning medicine as previously described. If it does not heal, the only remedy is to incise the abscess when it is ripe and remove all the moisture within or the pus.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see that it is diseased or black, then remove it with a tool whose shape is as follows:.
And it is called the rough-headed tool, made of Indian iron. Its head is rounded like a seed and engraved with fine engravings similar to those on scissors or razors. Place it on the diseased part of the bone and rotate it between your fingers while slightly tightening your hand until you know that the diseased part has been removed.
Do this repeatedly, then treat the area with drying and astringent medicines. If the area heals, flesh grows in it, and no discharge occurs for a period of time, and you keep it for forty days without it reopening or any incident occurring.
Know that he is cured, otherwise there is no recourse but to return the fistula to the nostril in this manner: Reopen the bone with an iron tool or a sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed, take a bifurcated probe of this form:.
Make the tip of the probe triangular, and its shaft conical, tapering to the tip as you see. Then place it on the bone itself; this should be near the throat, but keep your hand a little away from the eye. Then move your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
When he finds that air comes out when he covers his nose with his hand, at that moment apply astringent and drying medicines to the area as I have taught you. When the flesh grows and the place strengthens, the substance that was protruding outward will return inside the nostril, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Treatment of Eyelid Protrusions.
If the eyelid protrudes without causing any harm or reduction in vision, it is advisable to ease the patient and then perform cupping on the occiput. Place a leech on the occipital area without any specific condition and let it take a light meal.
Then apply a poultice to the eye made of acacia, soapwort, benzoin, and storax. Then bind the eye from above with many bandages. The preparation of the bandages is as follows: Take a large amount of soft lint and fold each piece into four layers to make many bandages.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye needs, then secure it with a strong piece of cloth tightly, and repeat the bleeding without restriction. Then remove the leech and leave the eye bound for a day and a night.
If the ligature becomes loose during this time, it should be tightened again. Remove the ligature after a day and a night as we said. If you see that the eye has improved, otherwise, repeat the dressing, medication, tightening, and bleeding until it improves.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On Cutting the Urethra.
If a hernia occurs in the urethral membrane and it protrudes outside the eyelids, resembling a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to cut it, then proceed as I describe.
This involves inserting a needle into the base of the hernia from bottom to top, then inserting another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the neck and passing it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut the midpoint of the doubled thread, tie it around some part of the hernia along with the needle and tighten it firmly. Then remove the needle and place wet wool soaked in egg white over the eye, leaving it until the threads fall off with the hernia. Then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals. The hernia may also be constricted from all sides with a circular bandage to increase its firmness, then treat it gently with a fine scalpel reaching deep into the eye to drain any excess moisture. Allow the eye to settle and shrink to its proper place, then bind it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
في علاج الكمنة.
هذه العلة التي تسمى الكمنة إنما هي مدّة تجتمع في العين تشبه الماء النازل وليس به، ووجه العمل في ذلك أن تقعد العليل على كرسي منتصبا ثم تأخذ رأسه بيديك من الجهتين.
وتحركه حتى ترى المدّة تصير إلى أسفل بعينك ثم تثبت ولا تزول وينطلق النور ويرى العليل الأشياء كما كان يراها، وإن لم تنزل إلى أسفل علمنا أنّه الماء، فإن لم يتهيّأ نزول المدّة بما ذكرنا.
وإلا فأجلس العليل بين يديك ثم خذ مبضعا رقيقا وشقّ به فوق الغشاء القُرني قليلا عند اتصال الملتحم بالغشاء القُرني في الإكليل حتى تخرج المادّة.
فلما خرجت فقطّر في العين ماء حارا قد مزجت فيه عسلا أو ماء قد أغليت فيه حلبة وعسلا ثم تعالج بسائر العلاج حتى يبرأ،.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
قد ذكرنا أنواع الماء في التقسيم وأيّها يصلح للقدح بكلام مشروح مفسّر فتأخذه من هناك على الصحّة، فحينئذ ينبغى أن تجلس العليل بين يديك متربعا قبالة الضوء قرب الشمس.
Bind his healthy eye tightly, then raise the eyelid of the affected eye with your left hand if it is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the lancet near the cornea, at the thickness of a morsel in the white part of the eye towards the lesser sigmoid vein. Then push the lancet forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel that the lancet has reached an empty space.
It is advisable that the depth to which you insert the lancet should be equal to the distance from a child's pupil to the edge of the iris, for copper can be seen clearly through the cornea due to its clarity. Then move the lancet upwards to the area where the fluid is located.
Then press it downward repeatedly. If the fluid comes out immediately, the patient will see whatever is opened to his sight at once, with the lancet still in his eye. Then let him rest for a while; if the fluid rises again, release it a second time without removing the lancet.
When it stabilizes and does not rise again, gently remove the lancet while twisting it slightly little by little. Then dissolve a small amount of pure crystal salt in the fluid and wash the eye with it from the inside. Then place a wet piece of flax or wool over the entire outer surface of the eye.
Apply rose ointment and the white of an egg, and bind the healthy eye with it. As for us and people of our time, we place ground cumin mixed with the white of an egg on it. If the lancet refuses to enter the eye due to its hardness, as some people have very hard eyes indeed. You should take the scalpel known as al-birid, which has this shape:.
Then, with it, pierce only the conjunctiva and do not deepen the incision; rather, gently tap the area where you will make the puncture, then insert the probe as previously described. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a secure bed to lie on, so that they can sleep on their back in a dark room.
He must avoid all movements and coughing. His food should be whatever softens his nature. He must not move his head left or right at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, after which it is removed in that dark room, and then you test his sight.
Show him various objects, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. It is not advisable to do this during treatment or immediately after piercing, as it is best to avoid this before because excessive fluid can rise quickly due to intense looking.
If a hot swelling occurs, you should release the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what soothes the swelling until it subsides. Then, at that time, allow him to open his eyes and place a scarf over his face through which he can look for days while in that dark room, then.
He should gradually leave the house and proceed with his recovery. Know that the learner cannot do without observation when performing punctures, so he must proceed with caution. I have heard from some Iraqis that one of them mentioned making a perforating probe in Iraq that absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make such a thing, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients. It is possible that this is a recent innovation. This is an image of various types of probes for those who are unfamiliar with them:.
It is made of copper and its tip should be of this thinness, triangular and sharp.
Chapter Twenty-four.
On the Treatment of Excess Tissue in the Nose.
Different types of excess tissue may grow in the nose. Some resemble long-legged scorpions, some are hard and cancerous-like, pale in color, and others are soft and not pale in color.
For those among these tissues that are soft, not malignant nor cancerous, the patient should sit before you facing the sun. Open his nostril and insert the probe into the tissue, then pull it outwards. Then cut what you can reach with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side.
Continue until you are sure that all the tissue has been removed. If there is any part left that you cannot cut, remove it gently with one of the fine instruments so that nothing remains. If bleeding becomes overwhelming or if a hot swelling appears,
counter it as appropriate. If it is a malignant tumor, act promptly and remove it until the bleeding stops and all the tissue is gone. Then after cutting, pour vinegar and water or a solution into the nose to allow the moisture to pass through to the throat.
Know that he has recovered, but if the moisture does not pass as it should, know that there is excess tissue growing on top of the porous bones which the instrument did not reach. In such a case, you should take a linen thread of moderate thickness.
And it is tied with many knots, and there is the length of a finger or less between each knot. The patient devises to insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever means he can after shaping it like a button and pulls it until it reaches the nostril.
It is then brought out at the throat, and boys in school often do something like this. It is easy for one who wishes to do it. Then gather the two ends of the thread, the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to separate the flesh, do this until you know that the flesh has been divided by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread and after wiping away the blood, insert a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh. Then finally, insert a lead tube into the nose for days until it heals. If drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is a picture of the dropper used to administer oils and medicines in the nose:.
He places one made of silver or copper, resembling a small lamp with an open oil reservoir and its channel designed similarly.
If you prefer, you can make the tube closed like a reed and have the dropper's reservoir flat.
It has a handle at the end as you can see, which is held when oil or any juices or flowing substances are heated in it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
في الثآليل النابتة في طرف الأنف.
كثيرًا ما ينبت في طرف الأنف ثآليل تعظم وتزداد مع الأيام حتى تقبح منظره.
ولذلك ينبغي أن تقصه في أول ظهوره وتستأصل جميعه ثم تحمل على الموضع إما الكي وإما الدواء المحرق الذي يقوم مقام الكي، فإن فات قصه حتى يعظم فانظر فإن كان متحجرا صلبا كمد اللون قليل الحس.
فلا تعرض له بالحديد فإنما هو ورم سرطاني وكثيرًا ما رأيت من قطع هذا الورم فعادت منه بليّة عظيمة على صاحبه، وإن كان الورم ليّن المجهس غير كمد اللون ورأيت أن القطع يمكن في جميعه. فاستفرغ العليل واقطعه بلا حذر ولا توقَّ وعالج الموضع بما يجفف ويقبض حتى يبرأ،.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
في خياطة الأنف والشفة والأذن. إذا تفرق اتصالها عن جرح أو نحو ذلك أعلم أنه متى حدث تفريق في اتصال أحد هذه الغضاريف قلت ما ينجع فيه العمل إلا في بعض الناس.
فينبغى متى عرض لأحد شئ من ذلك فانظر إن كان الجرح طريًا بدمه أن تجمع شفتي الجرح بالخياطة ثم تعالجه حتى يبرأ، وإن كان تفريق الاتصال قد افترق شفتاه وصار كل شق صحيحًا فينبغي أن تسعل كل شق بثخن جلده الظاهر حتى يدمى.
Then the lips are sewn together and tightened, and powdered mastic and benzoin are applied to them. A plaster of Aleppo ointment or another adhesive ointment is placed on top of the bandage. It is left tightly bound for two or three days, then it is loosened.
The dressing is changed, and it is left until the stitches come out by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of sewing involves bringing together separated parts either with needles as described for sewing the abdomen or with thread as I have mentioned there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the Removal of Knots that Appear in the Lips.
Many people have small hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling corns and others varying in size. You should flip the lip and make an incision on each knot and extract it with forceps.
Cut it from all sides, then fill the area after cutting with powdered myrtle until the bleeding stops. Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On Removing Excess Tissue from the Gums.
Excess tissue often grows on the gums, which Apollonius called "abulus." You should grasp it with forceps or hold it with a probe and cut it at its base. Allow any bleeding to stop, then apply powdered myrtle to the area.
And if one of the contracted dried pieces of flesh returns after treatment, it often recurs, so cut it again and cauterize it, for it does not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On examining teeth with iron.
Crude and ugly scales may gather on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, as well as between the gums. These scales can cause discoloration, turning the teeth black, yellow, or green, leading to decay that reaches the gums and thus making the teeth unsightly.
You should seat the patient between your hands, with their head in your lap. Then remove the tooth or tooth that shows scales resembling sand until nothing remains. Do the same for black, green, yellow, and other discolored areas until they are clean.
If what is inside disappears after the first examination, otherwise repeat the examination on a second day, then a third day, until you reach your goal. Note that the tooth may require various tools of different shapes and forms according to what suits your work.
Because the tool used to examine a tooth from inside is different from the one used to examine it from outside, and the one used between teeth has a different shape. Here are several types of tools that you should have prepared:
Chapter Thirty.
On Extracting Teeth.
You should treat the tooth for its pain with every possible method and hesitate to extract it, as there is no substitute once it is extracted. This is because a tooth is a valuable substance, so extraction should only be done when absolutely necessary.
It is necessary when the patient decides to have a tooth extracted that you be certain until the diseased tooth and its pain are clear. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in the healthy tooth, so he has it extracted, but the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is removed; we have seen this happen repeatedly with barber-surgeons.
When you are certain of the diseased tooth, it is then necessary to outline around the tooth with a moderately sharp knife so that the gums are separated on all sides, and then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little until it becomes loose.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and place the patient's head between your knees to stabilize it so that it does not move. Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it; if it does not come out, take one of those instruments and gently but firmly work under it from all sides as you did initially.
If the tooth is hollowed out or decayed, it is necessary to fill that hole with a piece of cloth and tightly seal it with a thin end of cotton so that it does not break when you grasp it with forceps. It is also important to carefully outline around the gums on all sides.
Be cautious with your effort so as not to break the tooth, for if you do, part of it may remain and cause greater harm to the patient than their initial pain. Beware of doing what ignorant barber-surgeons do in dealing with the front teeth, rushing to extract them without using the methods we have described.
Often they suffer great calamities, the least of which is that a tooth breaks but its entire or part of its root remains. Or it may be pulled out along with some of the jawbone, as we have seen many times. Then rinse the area with a solution or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site, this often happens, so crush some colocynth and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if the colocynth does not help, here are images of the delicate pincers used to move the tooth; initially, they should have long prongs, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grasp the tooth with them. These are images of the larger pincers:
They should have thick handles so that when you grasp them, they do not bend or yield; the prongs should be short, and they should be made of Indian iron or well-tempered steel. The tips should have serrations that fit into each other to provide a firm and secure grip.
The prongs can also be shaped like a scalpel, making them strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Pulling Out Tooth Roots and Extracting Broken Jawbones.
If the root remains after extracting a tooth and it is broken, you should place a cotton pad soaked in fat on the area for one or two days until the area relaxes, then insert the probe or pincers. which resembles the beak of a bird called balrajah, and this is the picture of crayfish:
It should be made like a scalpel from the inside or like an iscalfaj. If it does not suffice to remove these crayfish with this method, you must dig around the base and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, which is pictured here:
It should be short and slightly thick, but not too thin to avoid breaking. If the base comes out with this method, otherwise use these other instruments which are pictured here, the first one having a triangular end and some thickness:
Another delicate triangular image:
We may also use this instrument with two prongs, which is also pictured here:
And other instruments and tools that were mentioned earlier for extracting teeth. We may also use this instrument resembling a large fish hook, which is pictured here:
With a triangular curved end and some thickness to avoid breaking, and it should not be too thin. Know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, as are other tools which cannot be counted. The skilled craftsman, guided by his work and experience with diseases, may invent tools for himself according to what the work and conditions suggest.
Because there are diseases for which earlier practitioners did not provide specific tools due to the variety of types. If a bone in the jaw or one of the mouth bones breaks or becomes infected, examine it in its place with an appropriate tool or crayfish forceps mentioned for extracting roots.
And we make use of this poultice, whose appearance is as follows:.
It should have some thickness to control the bone so that it does not slip until the bone comes out, and we treat the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone has slight decay or blackening, remove it until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the Extraction of Teeth That Have Emerged Incorrectly.
If the teeth emerge from their natural course, they disfigure the appearance, especially if this happens in women and slaves. It should be examined; if a tooth has emerged behind another tooth, then appropriate action must be taken.
And if it is not possible to extract or reduce it, remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument whose appearance is as follows:.
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian steel. The cutting should be done over several days due to the hardness of the tooth and to avoid disturbing other teeth. As for reducing it, use a file from India whose appearance is as follows:.
It is entirely made of Indian material, with a finely engraved part that resembles the file used to make needles. Use it to file the tooth little by little over many days gently so as not to dislodge the tooth and cause it to fall out. Finally, polish it and clean it with some scraper.
If a tooth is broken and causes discomfort to the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed until the roughness of the break is removed, making it smooth so that it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In joining loose teeth with silver or gold wires.
If the front teeth become loose or move due to a blow or fall, and if the patient is unable to bite on anything for fear of losing them, and if treatment with constrictive medicines has been unsuccessful.
The solution is to secure them with a gold or silver wire, and gold is better because silver can corrode and decay after days, whereas gold remains unchanged forever. The wire should be of moderate thickness, suitable for the space between the teeth.
The method of joining is to take the wire and insert its loop between the two healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the wire around the loose tooth or teeth until it reaches the other healthy tooth on the opposite side.
Then, repeat the weaving back to the side where you started, pulling gently and wisely until it is firmly secured. Tighten the wire at the base of the teeth so that it does not slip away. Finally, cut off the excess ends of the wire with scissors, tuck them together with wax, and hide them between a healthy tooth and a loose tooth.
To avoid injuring the tongue, leave it secured this way until it loosens or breaks. If that happens, secure it again with a new wire so that it remains in place for the rest of its life. This is an illustration of the teeth and the method of joining two healthy teeth and two loose teeth as you can see:.
A single tooth or two that have fallen out can be returned to their place and reattached as described, and they will remain in place. This is done by a skilled craftsman, who may also carve bone from the bones of an ox to make it resemble a tooth and place it where the tooth has been lost. It is secured as we said, and it remains in place, and one benefits from it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament that appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or it may be acquired from a wound that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth and placing their head in your lap, then lifting the tongue and cutting that nervous ligament across its width until the tongue is free from restraint. If it has some hardness or complexity and is due to a healed wound, apply a probe and cut it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot loosened.
Be careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh and sever an artery, which could cause bleeding. Then, after the cutting, rinse the area with rose water or vinegar diluted with cold water. Place a wick of flax under the tongue that the patient will hold each night.
To prevent it from rejoining a second time, if bleeding occurs, place powdered frankincense on the area. If the blood overwhelms you, treat the area with a convex iron heated for this purpose. Then treat him with all forms of treatment until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the Removal of a Toad Developed Under the Tongue.
A swelling resembling a small toad may occur under the tongue, preventing it from functioning normally; it may grow so large as to fill the mouth. The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth towards the sun and examining the swelling.
If you see that it is pale or black and hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not attempt to treat it, for it is a cancer. If it tends towards white with moisture in it, use forceps to grasp it and carefully cut it open with a sharp scalpel, then remove it completely from all sides.
If bleeding overcomes you during the procedure, apply powdered zinc oxide to stop the bleeding, then return to your work until it is completely removed. Finally, rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him with all appropriate forms of treatment until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the Treatment of Tumors of the Tonsils.
Any tumors that develop in the throat, including glands inside the throat that resemble those outside and are called tonsils, if treated as described in the classification and do not heal.
Examine it; if the tumor is hard, pale, and insensitive, do not treat it with iron. If it is red in color and its base is thick, also do not treat it with iron to avoid excessive bleeding. Instead, leave it until it matures, and either it will subside on its own or burst spontaneously.
And if it is white in color, circular, and its origin is thin, then this is what should be cut. The procedure is that you observe before working on it whether the hot inflammation has subsided completely or there has been some reduction.
Then seat the patient facing the sun and place his head in your lap. Open his mouth and have a helper beside you who will press down his tongue with an instrument, which has this shape:.
Make it from silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press down the tongue with it and the swelling becomes visible to your sight, take a hook and insert it into the lymph node, pulling it out as far as possible without pulling out any of the intestines along with it.
Then cut it with an instrument whose shape is like scissors, but its ends are curved, with each end very sharp. It should be made from Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with scissors of this shape:.
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one lymph node, cut the other in the same manner. Then after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which the peel of pomegranate or elm leaves or something similar that stops bleeding has been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers. Other tumors may also grow in the throat besides the lymph nodes, and you should cut them as mentioned for cutting the lymph nodes, similarly.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, extending towards the esophagus with little sensation, which nearly blocked the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and could not eat or drink water.
She was on the verge of death if she had waited one or two more days, as branches from the tumor had emerged through her nostrils. I acted quickly and inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, successfully removing a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where I could reach it from the nostril. Then I did the same for what protruded from the other nostril. After that, I opened her mouth, pressed her tongue aside, and inserted the hook directly into the tumor itself, then removed some of it without much blood loss.
Her throat was cleared, and she immediately began drinking water and eating food. We continued to remove parts of the tumor repeatedly over a long period of time, as the tumor kept regenerating what was cut. This process went on for some time.
I devised a strategy and treated the tumor inside her throat, which then stopped growing. She later left the area, and I do not know what happened to her after that.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cutting a Tumor in the Throat.
If it descends to the throat and swells, it is called a grape if it is white and elongated, and a pillar if it is thick at the bottom and round. If it is treated as described in the classification and the treatment does not succeed, it is referred to as a grape.
I saw that the hot tumor had subsided in her, and she was thin; therefore, it should be cut. But if it is collected into a round mass and has no length, and if its color is like dough or black or insensitive to touch, then cutting should be avoided.
There are risks for the patient in this case. Therefore, when you see it as described with its whiteness and length, sit the patient facing the sun and clamp their tongue with the tool that was previously described, then insert the instrument into the swelling.
Pull it down and cut it with one of the two tools mentioned for cutting the tonsils, but do not cut more than what exceeds the natural amount, as cutting more will harm the voice and speech.
After cutting, use the methods described for treating the tonsils until they heal. If the patient is hesitant to have it cut, then use a cautery without fear or hesitation. The method of cauterization involves using a sharp medicine, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then clamp the patient's tongue with the tool mentioned, then take the sharp water described in the chapter on cauterization and mix it to form a paste that is neither too thick nor too thin. Fill this mixture into the hollow of the tool, and here is its image:.
The end of the tool where you place the medicine should be hollow like a spoon. Place this tool with the medicine on the uvula itself, while the patient lies on their side so that saliva flows from inside their throat without dripping down to harm them.
Then grasp the medicine in your hand and squeeze it onto the sore for half an hour until you see it has darkened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. If you wish, take some cotton, wrap it around the tip of a rod, and dip the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the rod with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton sticks to the sore. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you desire in shrinking the swelling. Then leave it alone; it will wilt and fall off after three or four days. If you need to repeat the medicine, do so.
After cauterization, wipe around the swelling with cotton soaked in fat to clean the area of any remaining medicine. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with poultices and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and removes more fear.
The sore can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and cutting, such as treatment with incense. Take fuzang, uzofa, sausar, sudab, shih, babuna, qisun, and similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Boil the mixture with the pot covered in clay from the hilm (a type of clay), and make a hole in the middle of the lid. Fit an empty tube, made of silver or copper, over this hole as follows:
Insert the end with the bulb into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the sore along the tube until the sore is sufficiently treated. Repeat this several times until the sore wilts. Beware of performing this treatment at the initial onset of the swelling.
For often it increases in the tumor, and you should do this when its hot tumor subsides. If this instrument does not come to hand, take a reed and attach an eggshell to one end so that the patient's mouth is not burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the hot vapor from burning the mouth, and this is excellent in treatment and safe.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On removing splinters and other objects embedded in the throat.
Often a bone or fish spine or something else gets stuck in the throat, so you should remove what is visible after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the light.
So that you can see what is in the throat. What is hidden and concealed within should be induced to vomit before the food digests in the stomach; perhaps the stuck object will come out with vomiting, or the patient may swallow a piece of flax or a radish root.
Or the patient may swallow a piece of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge tied to a thread and swallow it; when it reaches the location of the splinter, pull the thread quickly. Do this repeatedly.
Often it will adhere to the splinter or bone and come out. If it does not come out as mentioned, then use an instrument made of lead in this form:.
It should be slightly thicker than a pipe and have a curved end that the patient gently inserts into their throat with their head raised, being careful not to touch the vocal cords to avoid causing coughing. The doctor may also insert it by hand to push out the bone or splinter.
And introducing the patient is better for his knowledge of the position of the embedded object, and he pushes it downward or pulls his hand upward with the instrument; all of this according to what is prepared until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On the Removal of Embedded Leeches from the Throat.
If the leech is treated with the methods mentioned in the division of medicinal treatment and it does not succeed, then at that time look into the patient's throat when the sun is present after pressing his tongue with the instrument described to you.
If your gaze falls on the leech, then pull it out with a small hook or a thin and firm twig. If you are unable to do so, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert an iron rod heated by fire into the tube.
Do this repeatedly, and have the patient abstain from water for his entire day. Then take a container filled with cold water, open the patient's mouth to it, and gargle with it without swallowing any of it, and stir the water from time to time with his hand.
If the leech falls to the place when it senses the water, if it does not come out as described, then fumigate the throat with urine and hartshorn using the instrument described for laryngeal fumigation; do this repeatedly, and it will fall out.
The purpose of the fumigation work is to take a container with hot embers from the fire, and cover the container with a lid that has a hole in it. Then attach one end of the instrument to this hole, then place the fumigant inside, and have the patient place his mouth on the other end of the tube and seal his mouth so that the smoke does not escape until he knows that the fumigation has reached his throat.
For the fluke falls on the seat, if it does not fall then the incense is repeated several times. The patient waits for thirst and eats salted foods and garlic but does not drink water, so it must come out with this management. This is a picture of an instrument that attracts the fluke from the throat when it comes into view.
It resembles pincers as you see, except that it has this curvature which enters the throat, and its ends resemble the mouth of a bird; if it catches onto something, it does not let go.
Another instrument is used to press the tongue; it is a wide hoop of iron, large enough to fit over the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth on its side so that the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and they are unable to remove it at all until it is taken off.
The description of the instrument used to open the mouth in exactly this manner.
Chapter Forty.
It deals with the discussion of binding tumors and incising them.
Tumors have many varieties, as will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in binding and incising them based on two aspects. One of these is the nature of the tumor itself and what moistures it contains.
The second aspect is based on the body parts where they occur, because a tumor occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the buttocks, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy part is different from one occurring in a joint. Each has its own rule for treatment.
There are tumors that should not be incised until the pus within them has matured and fully developed, and there are others that should be incised while they are still immature and have not yet fully ripened, such as tumors that are close to joints.
Because when a tumor occurs near a joint and persists until it corrupts the surrounding area, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, leading to prolonged disability of that limb, or the tumor may be near a principal organ.
Because if you delay incising it until it matures, you will harm that principal organ. Or the tumor may be near the buttocks; therefore, you should incise it while immature. It is necessary to incise a tumor that is not fully mature when it is near the buttocks so that it does not腐烂并侵入臀部内部，从而形成瘘管。
It may result in a condition that does not heal completely. You should know the time to incise tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and swelling decrease, the head of the tumor becomes soft, and other signs are evident.
It is advisable to make the incision at the lowest part of the tumor if possible, so that the discharge can flow downward more easily, or in the most tender part of the tumor. The incision should follow the length of the body if the tumors are near the hands and feet.
Incisions should be made in areas away from muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, generally in flat areas without bends. If the area has bends, the incision should follow accordingly. However, if the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave it unincised.
Until it is fully mature as we have said, for if you incise it before that time, the purulent discharge will flow longer, and there will be much soiling and dirt. And his lips and nostrils may become adherent, and some tumors may be incised on the surface of the body in emergencies or according to what the part requires.
It is appropriate to use a single incision for small tumors and a wide incision or many cuts for large tumors, according to the size of the tumor. There are also tumors that require the skin to be stretched and cut if it has become like a rag.
It has become to some extent dead, like what is seen in many abscesses and hidden tumors. Some of them require a triangular incision, and others are cut in the shape of a hazelnut leaf, such as an arbie tumor.
Some require a circular incision or a crescent-shaped incision, and similar cuts. For those that do not have a head, such as smooth flat tumors, it is appropriate to use only a simple incision. If the tumor is large and has been around for a long time, when you incise it, do not rush to remove all the pus at once.
Instead, remove some of it and then compress the tumor until another day, then remove some pus again. Do this repeatedly in stages until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for often the vital spirit dissolves with the sudden expulsion of pus, and the patient may die unexpectedly. Beware of this greatly.
After you incise these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it. If the tumor incision is small or if there is a single simple cut, use linen bandages or old cotton. If the tumor is large and the cuts made during the incision are numerous, do otherwise as described.
You should insert a wick into each cut until they reach each other. If the tumor required cutting through some skin or creating a hole, you should fill it with old cotton or flax lint without moisture and keep it compressed for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during the procedure, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a piece of linen in them and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should employ treatment and remedies as described in many places in this book and in the relevant sections. If it is winter and the area of the tumor has many nerves, you should moisten the bandages with warm syrup and oil.
Place them on the affected area. If it is summer and the areas are inflamed, you should apply bandages soaked in cold water and oil or in cool syrup and oil. As we said on the third day, you should then unwrap the tumor and clean it.
Use similar treatments for it until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have described each tumor how to treat it, categorized and summarized.
Chapter Forty-One.
في شق الورام التي تظهر في جلد الرأس.
تظهر في جلد الرأس ورماً صغيرة، وهي من أنواع السلح التي تحويها صفاقات كأنها حوصلة الدجاجة، وأنواعها كثيرة: منها شحمية، ومنها ما يحوي رطوبة تشبه الحمأة.
ومنها ما تحوي رطوبة تشبه الدشيش والحساء ونحو ذلك، ومنها ما هي متحجرة صلبة. وكلها لا خطر في شقها وإخراجها ما لم يعترضك عند شقها شريان.
والعمل في شقها أن تسبرها أولاً بالآلة التي تأتي صورتها بعد هذا والتي تسمى المدس حتى تعلم ما تحوي. فإن كان الذي تحوي رطوبة، فشقها شقاً على الطول شقاً بسيطاً على هذه الصورة:.
وابدأ بالشق من خط ~ب~ إلى خط ~ج~. فإذا تفرغت الرطوبة، فاسلخ الكيس الذي كان يحوي تلك الرطوبة واقطعه جميعاً ولا تترك منه شيئاً البتة. فكثيرا ما يعود إذا بقى منه شيء.
ثم اغمس قطنة في المرهم الصري إذا حضر، وإلا في ماء الملح وا.setFill the gap with "ملأ به الجرح واتركه إلى يوم آخر فإن ihn يأكل ما بقى من الكيس، ثم أعد عليه القطنة بالمرهم الصري ثانية وثالثة إن احتجت إلى ذلك.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty tissue, cut it open in this manner:.
Make an incision in a hardened area and place the forceps at the edges of the wound and peel it back on all sides, exerting your effort to remove the omentum that contains it. If an artery is encountered, do as described for you afterward. Do the same with the tumor if it is encased within the incision.
The treatment is exactly as I have mentioned, and incising a hardened tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these tumors in the head may have no moisture at all; for instance, I made an incision on a tumor that.
I incised a tumor on the head of an old woman and found the tumor hard like a stone, rough and white, so much so that it would not break even if someone threw it, which would injure them. None of the other tumors that occur in the heads of people, such as those that appear in the heads of children, are like this one.
At the origins of the ears, incise them completely with a simple cut and make the bottom part open so that the discharge can flow downward easily. Then treat it with appropriate remedies.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Incising Tumors That Appear in the Neck. These tumors often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the armpit regions. They may also occur throughout the body. Those that appear in the neck are usually one or few and some of them develop from others.
Every sow of them is inside a special membrane as in abscesses and tumors of the head as we have described, and there are many types of these sows, some calcified, some containing moisture, and some foul and unresponsive to treatment.
I have not seen any of them in good condition to the touch; its appearance was close to the color of the skin, moving in all directions, and it was not adhered to the neck nerve or the thyroid cartilage nor a blood vessel, and it was not sunken. It is necessary to cut it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this shape from line ~ج~ to line ~ب~:.
And peel it from all sides and stretch the edges of the skin with a single clamp or two clamps or many clamps if necessary, as we mentioned in tumors of the head. Remove it little by little and be careful not to cut any vein or nerve. The scalpel should not be extremely sharp.
So as not to overcut with your hand or disturb the patient by cutting what is not necessary. If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, place powdered zinc or some small pieces that stop bleeding in the wound.
And close the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides and the wound relaxes, indicating that it is about to become pus-filled. At this point, stop bleeding and return to your work until you finish. Then examine with your index finger if any smaller sows remain and cut them out and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the pig’s tail, it should not be cut there. Instead, it should be tied tightly with a double thread until it falls off by itself without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment and treat it.
If the entire pig's tail is cut, you should gather the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately after ensuring that no part remains. If you see that a piece of the pig’s tail bone remains.
You should aim to cut at the root and base, and use suturing as we have mentioned. For pigs that contain moisture, apply a simple bandage where you see evidence of healing, and make sure the bandage covers the lower part as we said.
Then, after the bandage, use linen strips dipped in Egyptian ointment or similar to consume any remaining corruption. When you see that the wound has cleansed itself, treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On Incising the Throat for a Tumor Occurring Inside the Throat.
The earlier scholars mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is their discourse. As for those with a condition (disease), they should avoid making an incision in the throat as it does not benefit them.
Because all the veins and the lung are diseased, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no issue in the windpipe, it is necessary to use an incision in the throat to avoid the harm that can come from choking.
When we wish to do so, we should cut the throat below three or four circles of the trachea, a small incision in width between two circles, as much as the incision in the mesentery and not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for the incision.
Because it has little flesh and the blood vessels are far from it, if the surgeon is timid, he should stretch the throat skin with a retractor, then cut the skin until he reaches the trachea; if he sees any blood vessels, he should avoid them.
Then he should incise the mesentery as described, and determine the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that comes out with each coughing and from the interruption of voice; leave the wound open for a time until the period in which choking was feared has passed, then bring together the edges of the wound with skin sutures.
And it is treated separately from the cartilage, then use medications that promote flesh growth until he recovers. The author of this book explains that the meaning of this statement we quoted is when they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these tumors which were mentioned.
And when the patient is near death and his life is in danger, they resort to cutting the throat so that the patient can breathe through the incision and be saved from death. They are instructed to leave the wound open until the period of illness subsides, and this period should last three days or so.
At that time, they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until he recovers. What I witnessed myself was a servant who took a knife and made an incision on her throat, cutting part of her trachea. She was brought to me for treatment and appeared to be fainting as if slaughtered; upon examination, I opened the wound.
I found the blood that came out of the wound to be minimal, so I concluded that she had not cut an artery or a vein. The breath was coming out of the wound, so I quickly sutured the wound and treated it until it healed, and nothing happened to the servant except for hoarseness in her voice, no more.
She returned to her best condition after a few days. From this, we say that cutting the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On incising the tumor that appears in the throat from the outside and is called the elephant of the throat.
This tumor called the elephant of the throat is a large swelling in the color of the body. It is common in women and there are two types of it.
It may be either natural or accidental. As for the natural one, there is no remedy for it. As for the accidental one, it is of two kinds: one resembles fatty tumors, and the other resembles a tumor that results from the entanglement of an artery, and there is danger in incising it. It should not be subjected to treatment with a blade at all, except for what is small. If you probe it and examine it carefully and find that it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any arteries, then incise it as you would a fatty tumor. Remove it along with the capsule if it is within a capsule. If not, carefully extract all of it and then treat the area as necessary.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In the incision for various types of abscesses.
There are many types of abscesses, and I have mentioned all their kinds in the classification. Here, it is important to explain the difference between an abscess and a carbuncle, as this can be confusing. I say that a carbuncle is accompanied by heat, fever, and terrifying pains until the fermentation subsides. The pus completes its formation, and then the fever and intensity subside. An abscess does not come with heat, fever, or pain; it is contained within a specific serous cavity that matches the color of the body. It begins like a lentil and grows to resemble an egg, becoming larger or smaller.
There are two types of abscesses: one is fatty, and the other contains moisture, with various colors of moisture as mentioned in the classification. When you proceed to treat an abscess, you should first probe it and examine it with a tool called a medus, as its description will be shown in the subsequent section.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the medus and observe what comes out with it. If watery discharge of any color emerges, make a simple incision as described for other tumors. If no moisture comes out after using the medus, know that it is a fatty abscess.
Make a firm incision on it in the manner I have shown you, and hang it with clamps. Gently peel the skin away from all sides and, if possible, remove the serous cavity intact along with the abscess.
If the sac bursts during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, this often happens; remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part of it remains, whether little or much, the condition will most likely recur.
If the condition overpowers you and only a small part remains, clean the wound thoroughly with sharp corroding agents when you finish, tighten the wound, place something above it that quiets the hot swelling, and treat it with all remedies until it heals. If the defect is large, outline its edges and treat it to promote healing.
If a troublesome or non-troublesome vein is encountered and bleeding occurs, immediately clean the area with powdered cautery and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound begins to heal and the blood flow subsides. Then return to cutting what remains of the defect.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the Shapes of Instruments.
Those that are used for cutting and dissecting include the shapes of probes, which are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a Large Probe:
Image of a Medium Probe:
Image of a Small Probe:
They are made of steel with square tips that are sturdy to facilitate quick entry into tumors. These are the shapes of lancets, also known as cold instruments, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a Large Lancet:
Image of a probe in center:.
Image of a small probe:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, surgical incisions, fistulas, and cavities to determine what is inside them, such as bones or other contents. It should be made smooth and polished like a cone from Chinese copper, brass, copper, iron, or silver; the best is made of brass.
Probes can also be made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas where there is a curvature at the depth, as they can bend with that curvature. They come in three types: long, medium, and short.
The size of each probe should be appropriate for the depth of each fistula, and its thickness should match the width of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe:.
Image of a medium lead probe:.
Image of a small lead probe:.
Images of forceps, which come in many types. There are simple ones, meaning those with one jaw, and they are divided into three types: large, medium, and small. There are also blind forceps, which are also divided into three types. Additionally, there are forceps with two jaws, which are also categorized into three types, as well as curved forceps with two jaws. They are divided into three types. There are also forceps with three jaws, which are also categorized into three types. Each type is needed in its specific place. Image of a large simple forceps:.

This is an image of a large scalpel used for incising and dissecting tumors; there are three types, large, medium, and small:
Image caption: A medium scalpel:
Image caption: A small scalpel:
The sharp edges used for incision are limited, while the other ends are unrestricted. This design allows it to be used in dissecting tumors with caution to avoid cutting nerves or blood vessels, and provides some relief to the patient from the burning sensation during tumor excision.
These are the images of the surgical couches, which are of three kinds: some are large, others medium-sized, and others small. The image of a large surgical couch:.
It is made of a copper alloy that can be hammered, and on one end it resembles a wide spoon made of two layers, with the blade hidden at its tip, resembling a bird's tongue, which can be extended in and out as desired, as you can see.
Images of the scalpels that are concealed between the fingers when pressing on tumors so that the patient does not feel them; they are of three kinds: some are large, others medium-sized, and others small. Image of a large scalpel:.
Images of the bloodletting lancets, which are of three kinds: some are large, others medium-sized, and others small. Image of a large bloodletting lancet:.
It is made of copper or porcelain, slightly rounded in length as you can see, and should be thin. These types of bloodletting lancets should be available in large and small sizes to quickly draw blood when necessary and when no other medicine is at hand.
However, do not use it for cutting blood vessels in every part of the body; rather, use it in fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the arm, breast, abdomen, forearm, and similar moist fleshly organs.
And from them, other smaller instruments can be made that resemble pistachio shells, as shown in this illustration:.
It is used to cut blood if it flows from the venesection site or when cutting a vein or artery. It can also be made round, as shown in this illustration:.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the Treatment of Male Breasts.
Some people’s breasts may become swollen at the onset of puberty to the point where they resemble women’s breasts, remaining as ugly swellings. For those who dislike this, it is advisable to make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast as shown in this illustration.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~:. Then remove all the fat, fill the wound with healing fatty medicine, and stitch the edges of the incision together. Treat it until it heals. If the breast sags downward and droops due to its bone structure as often happens in women.
It is advisable to make two incisions in the upper sides of the breast, resembling a crescent shape, connecting at their ends to form larger and smaller arcs around each other as shown in this illustration:. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then remove the skin between the two incisions, extract the fat, and use the stitching and bandaging methods, along with any other necessary treatment, until it heals.
If you are unable to excise what should be excised due to the patient's anxiety or because of excessive bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of a type similar to pigs, solid and enclosed in a sac. Some contain moisture; those that do should be incised in a crescent shape as follows.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Once you have completely evacuated all the contents of the tumor over a period of time, pack it with old cotton and leave it for another day, then remove the cotton.
Treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of pig's nodules, incise it as described in the section on incision for pigs. If the wound persists and pus spreads, apply cauterization as previously mentioned.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On incising a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, and it is called aneurysm.
If an artery is cut and the skin above it heals, a tumor often appears as a result. The same can also occur with a vein, where swelling and a tumor may appear.
And the signs by which it is known whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it will be elongated and gathered deep in the body; and when you press on the tumor with your finger, you feel it as though it has a grating sound.
And if it is from a vein, the tumor will be round on the surface of the body; and cutting into these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, elbow, neck, and many other places in the body that are very large; therefore, treatment with iron should be avoided.
And those in the limbs or in the head should also be avoided; if it is an expansion at the mouth of an artery, then cut into the skin longitudinally, then open the incision with pincers, then peel away the artery and free it from the fasciae.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, then tie off the artery with a double thread in two places as I have described in tying off the arteries in the temples. Then cut between the ligatures until all the blood has come out.
And the swelling will resolve, then use treatments that promote suppuration until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from cutting into a vein, then grasp as much of the tumor with the skin as possible with your hand, then insert a needle below where you are grasping and pass it through with a double thread until it emerges on the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly as I have told you about tying a grape from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
Tighten your threads at four places, then cut open the tumor in the middle until what is inside comes out, then cut off the excess skin but leave what was tied. Then place a dressing on it that has been soaked in syrup and oil. Then use the treatment that involves bandages and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that results from nerve strain.
Just as a tumor can occur in an artery or vein, a tumor can also occur in a nerve if it is struck or due to excessive fatigue or similar causes. This is more common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where a joint moves, there is a wandering tumor that has the same color as the rest of the body. It is usually painless, but when pressed firmly, the patient feels a sensation like numbness. The tumor does not gather deeply within the flesh.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in all directions but does not go forward or backward. If it occurs in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, as it may cause long-term issues. If it occurs on the head or forehead,
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with tweezers and cut it from its base. If it is large, attach it to a traction device, peel it off, then remove it and stitch the wound together, treating it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the Cutting of Warts That Appear on the Abdomen.
Warts, which are often found on people's abdomens and other parts of their bodies and are called fungal warts due to their resemblance to mushrooms, have a thin root and a thick head. They can split into two and grow from small ones to very large ones.
I once saw a man with two warts on his abdomen that most resembled mushrooms, white and thin at the root, having split into two parts and cracked, with moisture constantly seeping from them. I cut them out, and they weighed about eighteen ounces for one and six ounces for the other.
To perform the cutting, examine the patient. If the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and has a thin root, cut it with a wide scalpel. Have cautery irons ready in the fire because often a lot of blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding becomes overwhelming, apply cautery. If the patient is timid and frightened by cutting with iron, take a tight lead thread and tie it around the wart that has this description, then leave it for two days. Then tighten the lead thread more, continuing to do so.
Tighten the thread until it affects the wart so that it falls off on its own without further effort. If the wart has a thick root, there is some risk in cutting it, especially those found on the abdomen. However, it may be possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of exposing yourself to cutting a tumor that is pale in color, insensitive, and repulsive in appearance, for it is a cancerous swelling, and we will come to mention cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the Treatment of Umbilical Hernia.
Umbilical hernia has many causes; either it results from the rupture of the abdominal fascia, through which the intestines or bowel protrude as in other hernias, or it is due to blood that emerges from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned, or it is caused by gas that accumulates inside.
If it is due to the rupture of the abdominal fascia and the protrusion of the intestines, then the color of the swelling will resemble the color of the body, it will be soft without pain, and its appearance will vary in position. If it is due to the protrusion of the bowel, its position will differ even more from what we have described; if you press on it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns, and there may be gurgling sounds. It also tends to enlarge significantly when taking a bath or after severe exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It does not disappear if you press it with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, the swelling will appear dark alongside these signs. If it is due to a growth of flesh, the swelling will be raised and hard, and it will remain at a constant size.
If it is due to gas, touching it will be soft. The approach in such cases is to observe; if the umbilical hernia is caused by blood from an artery or vein, or by gas, you should refrain from treating it, as there is a risk and potential harm involved, as I informed you in the chapter that discusses tumors arising from arteries or veins.
If the umbilical hernia is towards the abdomen or the flank, you should order the patient to hold themselves and stand erect. Then apply a plaster around the entire navel. Then order him to lie down in front of you on his back. Then make a wide incision around the navel where you applied the plaster. Then push up the center of the swelling with a large forceps, then tightly tie off the area of the incision with strong thread or silk.
The knot of the ligature should be a slipknot. Then open the center of the constricted swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger to feel for the intestines. If you find that the intestines have been caught by the ligature, loosen the slipknot and push the intestines back into the abdomen. If you find a hernia, hold it with forceps.
Cut away the excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads, then insert the needles into the incision made around the swelling at four points where they have been passed through, then secure the swelling in four places with the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area so that the constricted flesh rots and falls off on its own, or cut it when it has become thin and rotten. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia consists of protruding flesh.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should incise the swelling as described and remove the blood or moisture that you find within. Then treat it with something that will heal the area.

في علاج السرطان.
في التقسيم ذكرنا أنواع السرطان وكيفية علاجها بالأدوية، وتحذير من علاجه بالحديد لئلا يتقرح، وذكرنا أيضا السرطان المتولد في الرحم والتحذير من علاجه.
وذكرت الأوائل أنه متى كان السرطان في موضع يمكن استئصاله كله، مثل السرطان الذي يكون في الثدي أو في الفخذ ونحوها من الأعضاء المتمكنة لإخراجه بجملته، ولا سيما إذا كان مبتدئاً صغيراً. وأمّا متى قدم وكان عظيماً فلا ينبغي أن تقربه.
فعندما استطعت لم أبرئ منه أحداً، ولا رأيت قبلى غيري يصل إلى ذلك. والعمل فيه إذا كان متمكنا كما قلنا أن تتقدم فتسهل من المررة السوداء مرارا ثم تفصده إن كان في العروق امتلاء بيّن.
ثم تنصب المريض نصبة يتمكن فيها من العمل، ثم تلقى في السرطان الصنانير التي تصلح له، ثم تقوره من كل جهة مع الجلد على استقصاء حتى لا يبقى شيء من أصوله، واترك الدم يجري ولا تقطعه سريعا.
بل اعصر المواضع وأسلت الدم الغليظ كله بيديك أو بما أمكنك من الآلات. فإن اعترضك في العمل نزف دمعظيم من قطع شريان أو وريد فاكو العرق حتى ينقطع الدم، ثم عالجه بسائر العلاج إلى أن يبرأ.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids.
In the classification, we have informed about the types of dropsy, how water accumulates in each type, the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines. The type that is treated with iron is solely the zaki (visceral) type; the tabbi (peripheral) type and the lahani (fleshy) type are never approached with iron at all.
If that is the case, it is fatal; if you have treated this zaki type of hemorrhoids with medicines and your treatment has not been successful, then examine whether the patient is extremely weak or suffers from another illness in addition to the hemorrhoids, such as.
cough or diarrhea, and the like; then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, has no other illness besides hemorrhoids alone, and is neither a child nor an elderly person, then the approach to treatment should be to have the patient stand before you. And have a servant stand behind him to squeeze his abdomen with his hands and push the water downward towards the pubic region. Then take a sharp instrument in this manner:.
long and defined at both ends like a scalpel, except that it is slightly blunt so as not to pierce too deeply into the intestines during the procedure and cause harm. Then observe; if the hemorrhoids have developed from the side of the intestines.
You should make an incision three fingerbreadths below the navel, above the pubic region. If the hemorrhoids have developed due to liver disease, your incision should be three fingerbreadths to the left of the navel. If they have developed due to spleen disease, your incision should be three fingerbreadths to the right side.
Also, it should not be incised on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down so that the exudate does not flow to that weak area. Then puncture the skin completely with the instrument, then insert the instrument into this incision and raise your hand.
With the scalpel, between the skin and subcutaneous tissue as if you were peeling it, and the amount you peel should be about the size of a fingernail or similar. Then puncture the serosa until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the fluid is, then remove it and insert into this hole the instrument which looks like this.
It is similar to a tube made of thin reed, crafted from silver or copper or polished sheet metal. At the bottom, it has a small hole, and on its sides, there are three holes: two on one side and one on another side as you can see.
And its end may be sharpened like that of a pen, as shown in this illustration:.
At the top of it is a ring. When the instrument reaches the fluid, it will flow onto the instrument immediately. Therefore, let an adequate amount of fluid be drained over time because if you drain more than what is appropriate at once, the patient may die due to the dissolution of their vital spirit.
Or he may become unconscious, nearly dying. However, drain from him according to his strength, as indicated by the patient's condition, such as the strength of his pulse and the improvement in his color. Then remove the instrument and stop draining the fluid, for it will be stopped immediately.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the serosa which you were told to seal as described, then reinsert the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it.
Also, a small amount of water is removed; you do this for several days while keeping the neck [or part in question] dry and being careful not to make a mistake so that only a little water remains. If you are concerned about the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat it by burying it in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, keeping him thirsty, and treating him with drying medicines until he recovers, and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described above.
Chapter Fifty-five.
On the treatment of children who are born with the urethral opening not pierced or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their urethra not pierced, so it is necessary to pierce it as soon as they are born.
With a very thin scalpel, as shown in this illustration:.
Then place a thin lead pin in the hole and secure it for three or four days. When he needs to urinate, move it aside, then put it back afterward. If you do not use the lead, the urine passing through that area may prevent it from closing up.
As for those whose urethral opening is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we have said for many days until it widens. Those whose urethra is in the wrong place are also treated: some are born with the opening at the end of the urethra and thus cannot urinate forward.
Until he raises the urethra with his hand upwards, and it should not protrude before him because semen cannot reach the uterus straight, which is a very ugly defect, and the reason for this work is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his urethra with your left hand strongly, and shave the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade like a penknife or as if you were carving something to make it protrude like a ball so that the hole is in the center as required.
Be cautious during your work about bleeding, as it often occurs, so counteract it with something that stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six
On the abscess that occurs in the bladder, urethra, blackish area, corruption, and adhesion of the bladder to the urethra.
This abscess often occurs in the urethra, it is a fleshy swelling and can be either malignant or non-malignant. The non-malignant one should be attached with a delicate fishhook.
Cut it until you cleanse it completely, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, and afterward treat it with palm ointment until it heals. However, if the abscess is malignant and dark-colored, cauterization should be used after cutting and exposing it.
If the abscess is in the foreskin of a person who has not been circumcised, and part of the abscess is inside the foreskin while part is outside, then you should first remove the part of the abscess that is inside until it heals, and then treat the external part.
For when you treat them together, you cannot be sure that the tunica vaginalis will not rupture. It may also happen in the testicles and in the tunica vaginalis that they turn black and become diseased; therefore, it is necessary to excise all that has turned black or is about to decay or has already decayed.
Then apply honey mixed with ground and sieved pomegranate peels and wormwood. Then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery as shown in this figure:.
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, namely bleeding and a diseased wound. If the tunica vaginalis atrophies and disappears altogether at some point, it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adherence of the tunica vaginalis to the testicle:
This adherence occurs in those whose tunica vaginalis is intact and who have not undergone circumcision. It may also occur due to a wound or swelling. Therefore, it is necessary to peel it off with a thin scalpel until the ligament loosens and the testicle is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them during examination, then peel off some of the testicle and tunica vaginalis. The tunica vaginalis is thin and may rupture quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the tunica vaginalis from the testicle with a fine linen strip moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere as well.
Then treat it with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
في طهارة الصبيان وعلاج ما يعرض لهم من الخطر.
الختان ليس بشيء غير تفريق الإتصال كسائر الجراحات إلا أنه لكونه من عملنا بإرادتنا واستعماله في الصبيان خاصة وجب أن نرسم فيه العمل الأفضل.
وال طريق الأسهل المؤدي إلى السلامة، فأقول إنّ الأوائل لم تذكر الختان في شيء من كتبها لأنّه لم يكن يستعمل في شرائعهم وإنما هو ما اكتسبناه.
بالتجربة وذلك أنى وجدت الجمهور من الصناع والحجامين يستعملون التطهير بالموس وبالمقص ويفعلون الفكة والربط بالخيط والقطع بالظفر وقد جربت جميع هذه الوجوه.
فلم أجد أفضل من التطهير بالمقص والربط بالخيط لأن التطهير بالموس كثيرا ما تلوذ له الجلدة لأنه جلدة الغلفة طبقتان فربما قطعت الجلدة العليا وبقيت الطبقة السفلى.
فيضطر إلى قطع آخر وألم مستأنف والتطهير بالفكة لا يؤمن معها قطع طرف الإحليل لأنّه ربما دخل في ثقبها، وأمّا التطهير بالظفر فربما فلت الجلدة وفسد عملك أو كانت جلدة الصبي قصيرة بالطبع..
فكثيرا ما يولدون كذلك لا يحتاجون إلى تطهير وقد رأيت ذلك، وأمّا التطهير بالمقص والربط بالخيط فالتجربة كشفت لي فضله لأن المقص متناسقة القطع من أجل أن الشفرة التي من فوق كالشفرة التي من أسفل.
When you press your hand with the proper alignment of the blades, you will make a single measurement and cut in one time without error at all; the stitch should be like a wall around the bladder's skin from every side. The first step is to instruct the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his bladder and leave it for another day, then cheer him up and please him with every face you can make and what his mind accepts, then have him stand before you upright.
He must not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy's eye does not fall on them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his bladder and blow into the skin and lift it up until the tip of the bladder comes out.
Then clean it from what accumulates in it of dirt. Then tie the marked place with a folded thread, then tie another one a little below it. Then grasp with your thumb and index finger the lower tying spot well and cut between the two ties. Then lift the skin up quickly and pull out the tip of the bladder, then let the blood flow a little as it is better and causes less swelling of the bladder. Then dry it with a wet cloth, then sprinkle it with dried and burned gourd ash, which is the best I have tried, or flour of barley, which is also excellent.
Then lift the skin up quickly and pull out the tip of the bladder, then let the blood flow a little as it is better and causes less swelling of the bladder. Then dry it with a wet cloth, then sprinkle it with dried and burned gourd ash, which is the best I have tried, or flour of barley, which is also excellent. Then place him on a cushion from above with a piece of cloth that contains a boiled egg yolk mixed with rose water and beaten with fresh, fragrant rose oil, and leave it on him for another day. Then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
This is a picture of scissors suitable for cleansing:.
They should be straight, sharp scissors with the screws for adjustment, and the length of the blades should be equal to the handles. As for the mistake that may occur during cleansing, it might turn the inner skin completely or partially when cutting; therefore, you should stretch it immediately with your fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a needle and cut it. If three days have passed and the area below the urethral opening remains swollen and red, leave it until the inflammation subsides, then peel it off gently.
Cut it as seems appropriate to you, but be careful around the urethral opening. If you accidentally cut part of the urethral opening, it does no harm; treat it with substances that promote wound healing as described in the chapter on powders.
If you cut more than the required amount of skin and it retracts upwards, this does not cause significant harm either. Treat it as we have described until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the Treatment of Retained Urine in the Bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder is due to obstruction by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or a growth, and similar causes. If you treat this with the methods of treatment described in the classification.
If the urine does not pass and you see that its retention is due to a stone damaging the neck of the bladder, then have the patient sit on his knees, then lie down with one leg over his back, arching his abdomen upwards, and hold himself still as much as possible.
At that time, the neck of the bladder will push the stone backward so that urine can flow out. If it does not flow out as mentioned and the patient's condition worsens, it is necessary to use a device called catheters, which have this design:.
It is made of silver and should be thin, smooth, and hollow like a bird's feather tube, about one and a half inches long, with a delicate nozzle at the end. The way to draw out urine with it is to take a folded thread and securely tie wool or cotton to one end.
Insert the thread end into the bottom of the catheter and trim any excess wool so that it fits inside the tube like a plug. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and have the patient sit on a chair.
Moisten the bladder and urethra with wet lubricants or oil and warm water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches its base. Then bend the urethra upward toward the navel and push the catheter further inside.
Once the urethra is bent, push the catheter inside until it reaches near the buttocks. Then tilt the penis downward while the catheter is inside and continue to push it until it reaches the bladder. The patient will feel when it enters an empty space.
It is made this way because the urinary passage has curves. Then pull the thread with the wool tightly for a moment, as the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it and pour out the urine, and reuse the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is empty and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to Inject the Bladder with a Syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long tube as thin as pus. If you want to drop water and medicine into it, it should be done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its shape:.
It is made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long tube as thin as silk, entirely hollow except for the end, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other side as you can see.
The hollow part where the tube is should fit snugly without any excess so that when you pull it, it attracts moisture, and when you push it, it pushes the liquid to a distance, as is done with a device used to throw oil during sea battles.
If you want to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull with the tube upward; the moisture will be drawn into the hollow of the syringe. Then insert its end into the urethra as described for catheters, and then push the moisture out with the tube.
This moisture will reach the bladder, and the patient will be aware of it. This is also a delicate syringe used to inject the bladder:.
It is made of silver or spadarium, with the top resembling a small funnel, and below it there is a groove where the strap fits. Then take a camel's bladder, place the moisture you want to inject into the bladder in it, and tie it securely between the grooves with folded thread.
Warm that moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the catheter into the urethra. Then grasp the bladder with the moistened hand firmly so that the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If a bladder is not available, take a piece of thin leather and make a circle from it. Pierce it all around and then insert a tight thread through those holes as it rotates. Then gather the circle together like folding a napkin after placing in it what you want of moisture, oils, or water.
Then tie it to the machine and use it as you did with the bladder by pressing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the Removal of Stones.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with drugs, and I have described the difference between a stone formed in the kidney and one formed in the bladder, as well as all the signs of this. I also discussed the stones that require manual removal or surgical incision.
These are the stones formed in the bladder, particularly those that obstruct the urethra. I will describe this with a clear explanation and conciseness.
I say that the stone formed in the bladder most often affects children. One of its signs is that urine exiting the bladder is similar to water in thinness.
Rash appears, and it causes irritation and discomfort. It often hangs down and then spreads, causing the buttocks to protrude in many cases. Children can easily be relieved of this condition until they reach fourteen years of age, while elderly people find it difficult. For young adults, it is somewhere between these extremes.
And the one whose stones are larger is easier to treat, and the smaller ones are the opposite. When we proceed to treatment, it is first necessary to administer an enema that expels all the feces in the intestines, for it may prevent the detection of the stone during examination.
Then, take the patient by his legs and shake him downward to allow the stone to descend to the neck of the bladder, or have him jump from a height several times. Then seat him upright in front of you with his hands under your thighs so that the entire bladder is tilted downward, then examine him.
Examine him externally; if you feel the stone in the space, proceed immediately to incise for it. If it does not come within your reach at all, then smear the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a child, or use the middle finger.
If the patient is an adult male, insert your finger into his rectum and search for the stone until it comes within your reach. Then move it slowly toward the neck of the bladder and press on it with your finger to push it out towards the place where you intend to make the incision.
Order a servant to press on the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to raise the scrotum with his right hand and pull down the skin below it from aside the place where the incision will be made. Then take the scalpel, which has this form:.
Make the incision between the rectum and the scrotum, not in the middle but towards the left side. The cut should be directly over the stone, with your finger in the rectum pushing it outward gently so that the external opening is wide and the internal part narrow enough to facilitate the passage of the stone.
Do not enlarge it, for the finger may press on the stone in the bladder when cutting, and it may come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones with edges and corners that make their exit difficult for this reason.
And there are smooth ones that resemble acorns and rounded ones that easily come out. Those with edges and corners should be cut slightly more to facilitate their exit. If they do not come out this way, it is necessary to devise a method to grasp them with a tightly folded cloth whose end is like a blade.
He should secure the stone so it does not slip from his grasp. Or he may insert a delicate tool with a curved tip beneath it. If that is not possible, widen the incision slightly. If bleeding becomes excessive, stop it with cautery.
If there is more than one stone, push the larger one first towards the bladder's mouth and then make an incision on it. Then push the smaller ones after that. Do this similarly if there are more than two stones. If they are extremely large, it is unwise to make a large incision because it risks two outcomes for the patient.
Either he may die, or he may suffer permanent incontinence because the area will not heal properly. However, try to push them out until they come out, or devise a method to break them into pieces with forceps so that they can be removed.
When you are finished with your work, dress the wound with cotton wool and bandages, then secure it with a cloth soaked in oil and syrup or ointment made of frankincense and cold water to soothe the hot swelling. The patient should lie on his stomach, and do not remove the dressing until the third day.
When it dissolves, wash the area with a lot of water and oil, then treat it with the powdered frankincense ointment and the balsam ointment until it heals. If there is a hot swelling or ulceration in the wound or something similar, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination, which can be known by the presence of blood coming out with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will lead to the deterioration and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type accordingly until it heals.
It is advisable at all times during treatment to bind the thighs together and bring them close to ensure that the medicines applied remain effective. If the stone is small and lodges in the urethra, obstructing the flow of urine, treat it with what I will describe before it reaches a point where incision becomes necessary.
This treatment often suffices without the need for incision, as I have experienced. It involves taking a tool made of steel, which looks like this: .
The tool is a sharp-pointed triangle attached to a stick. Then, take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder. Then insert the pointed instrument gently into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the instrument gently against the stone bit by bit, aiming to pierce it until you can pass it through from the other side. Once this is done, urine will flow immediately. Then grip what remains of the stone with your hand outside the penis; it will break apart and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not available to you due to an obstacle preventing it, tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then make an incision on the stone itself in the penis between the ties, then remove it.
Then loosen the ties and clean out the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The thread is tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other tie above it so that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin up so that it returns to its place after you finish and covers the wound as we said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
On Removing Stones from Women.
Stones rarely form in women. If a stone does occur in one of them, treating it is difficult for many reasons. One reason is that the woman may be unmarried, and another is that you cannot find a woman who would permit herself to be examined by a doctor.
If she is chaste or has relatives who guard her honor, the third reason is that you cannot find a woman skilled in this craft, especially manual work. The fourth reason is that the location for the incision to reach the stone in women is far from where the stone is, requiring a deep incision.
There is danger in that. If necessity requires it, you should seek a skilled female physician, but such are rare. If she cannot be found, then request a virtuous and gentle male doctor or bring a midwife who is knowledgeable about women's matters or a woman who can advise on this craft to some extent.
Open it and instruct her to do all that you order her to do regarding the examination of the stone, which is to look if the woman is a virgin; then she should insert her finger into her rectum and examine the stone. If she finds it, she should press it under her finger.
At that point, order her to make the incision. If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and examine the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should push the stone from the mouth of the bladder downward to the extent of her ability until she reaches the top of the thigh. Then she should make an incision opposite the midpoint of the vagina at the top of the thigh, wherever it is easier for her and where she can feel the stone.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it underneath. Initially, make a small incision, then insert the probe into this small incision. If she feels the stone, increase the size of the incision as much as necessary for the stone to be removed. Know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small, some large; smooth, rough; long, round; with grooves. Recognize their types to guide you in what you seek. If bleeding overwhelms you, sprinkle the powdered zag on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Be sure to prepare for yourself the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men, as they will assist you in your work. If excessive bleeding overwhelms you and you know by the pulse of the blood that it comes from a severed artery, place the clamp on the area.
Apply the bandage tightly and leave it as such without retouching it, and do not remove the stone, for the patient may die. Then treat the wound; when the heat of the blood subsides after several days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until you have removed the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On Incising for Hydatid Cysts.
A hydatid cyst is an accumulation of moisture in the serous membrane, which is under the skin covering the testicle and is called the scrotum. It may also occur in a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
It may be mistaken for another testicle, and it occurs between the skin of the testicle and the serous membrane we have described, but this is rare. This cyst arises from a weakness in the seminal glands, which leads to the formation of this substance, and it can also result from an impact on the genital area.
This moisture can have many colors; it may be yellowish, reddish like blood, dark and blackish, or watery and white, which is the most common. The signs by which it is recognized are as follows:
Where the water accumulates, if it is in the serous membrane we have described, the swelling will be somewhat elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle will not be visible because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane for it, then the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, a person imagines it to be another egg. If the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white serous membrane, then it can be perceived by touch. As for knowing the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose appearance was described previously; whatever comes out after using the probe is judged according to what is inside it.
When it comes to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to have bloodletting if it is possible for him and his body appears full. Then he should lie on his back on something raised slightly, and place many pieces of cloth underneath him. You then sit at his left side.
Order a servant to sit at his right side and extend the penis towards one side of the skin of the testicle and toward the side of the inguinal canal. Then take a wide scalpel and make an incision in the skin of the testicle from the middle along its length, close to the pubic region.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the skin of the testicle into two halves, until it reaches the white serous membrane that contains it. Peel it carefully without cutting it, and peel more from the side that adheres to the egg (testis), as thoroughly as possible.
Then carefully and widely suture the serous membrane filled with water, remove all the fluid, then separate the edges of the incision with forceps. Extend the serous membrane upwards without touching the skin that encloses the testicle. Cut the serous membrane as much as you can, either in its entirety or piece by piece.
Especially pay attention to its thin side, because if you do not thoroughly cut it, you cannot be sure that the fluid will not return. If the testis protrudes outside of its skin during your work, after completing the cutting of the serous membrane, return it and then gather the edges of the skin of the testicle with stitches.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until he recovers. If the egg has become diseased with another illness, it is necessary to tie off the vessels in the scrotum to prevent bleeding, then cut out the testicle from the scrotum and remove the egg. Afterward, treat him with what we have mentioned.
If the water has gathered on both sides, then know that they are both hydroceles. Cut the other side as you did the first, whether it be necessary to treat them separately or if it is sufficient to treat them together, and then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool that has been soaked in oil or rose fat into the incisions. Then cover it with another layer of wool that has been soaked in a mixture of syrup and oil, and spread this over the testicles and the groin veins. Place a folded cloth on top, which is called a bandage. And secure it from above with a bandage that has six ends in this manner:
Then take two pieces of cloth, sew them together and fill them with loose wool as in this example. Make the ends that are used to tie it from cotton or wet wool. Gather them by pulling into a belt around the waist, and one end should be taken towards the buttocks to the back.
The second end should be taken towards the groin, and the other two ends on the thighs from below, and the remaining two ends on the calves. Gather all by pulling into a belt around the waist. This hydrocele can also be made by cauterization with iron instead of cutting.
This is done by taking a fine knife-like iron, and while it is hot, use it to cut through the skin of the testicle as described until the white serous membrane containing the water is exposed. Then take another iron like this:
It resembles the Greek eye, then wrap it with that sackcloth; it is hot until all the moisture comes out. Then patch the sack with small patches and peel off the layer containing it with an iron; cut as much as possible to remove it entirely and be careful not to let the fire touch the egg.
Know that this method is safer, farther from bleeding, and better than incision work. If an obstacle arises during the process of cutting or cauterizing, such as a hot swelling or bleeding, you should treat each issue appropriately with the appropriate remedy as previously discussed.
If the patient is timid and cannot endure this work due to its harshness, then let him use a poultice as I will describe it, and if it proves effective according to the evidence we have provided.
The discharge is watery; therefore, seat the patient on a high chair, then incise the swelling at its base with a broad scalpel. Apply a poultice along the length of the body, and make the opening wide enough for all the water to drain out completely. Then place cotton on the area and secure it.
Leave it to heal as the remaining water drains out, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out when you apply a poultice, it is because the white membrane is obstructing the opening of the wound, preventing the water from coming out.
In such a case, you should insert an eagle feather or the tool used to extract the water of hernias, whose image was previously shown, or increase the opening of the wound slightly.
Know that water may return and collect after six months or so. When it collects, apply the treatment in the same manner and defend the patient for his days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On Incising Fleshy Humps and Their Treatment.
Know that incising these fleshy humps is a dangerous procedure that often leads to death. Therefore, we prefer to leave them untouched and avoid them. I will now describe the procedures related to them and the types of tumors.
I say that many tumors may occur in the parts from which the genitals are composed, and this happens for various reasons: either due to excess moisture that flows to the genitals or due to a blow. The color of the tumor is the same as the body's color, and it does not contain water.
The tumor may be soft, or it may be hard like a stone, with no sensation. It can result from the complexity and swelling of arteries as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of veins. If it is due to the swelling of arteries, this can be identified by the dispersion of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be done at all. As for the one that results from the swelling of veins, nothing disperses when pressed with your fingers. This type may be incised, as well as other types of flesh.
This involves incising the skin of the scrotum, then lifting the testicle upwards and removing it from the white serous membrane. You should free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie off the vessels, and cut the cord after freeing it from all sides around the testicle. If the testicle is attached to that growing flesh,
It is necessary to remove the egg and cut it open. If the adhesion is between any of the serous membranes or between the organs, it is necessary to free all of that adhesion and cut it in a circular manner.
If the growth of flesh is in the adhesion area that is behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the egg as we have said. Once your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose ointment and solution, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids with Dilatation.
Dilatation is a twisted tumor, some of the twisting resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the sphincters and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. The treatment of this condition is closely related to what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as performed by earlier practitioners. I say that you should seat the patient on a high chair, then insert a dilator into the anus and push it downward, then grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
Another servant should hold it tightly and stretch it very hard, then make a wide, sharp incision along the vessels carefully until the vessels are exposed. Then peel them from all sides as I have mentioned to you in the peeling of arteries in the groin area, then insert a needle with doubled thread into them.
She should tie it at the first places where the drainage tube was shown and also at the last, then she should cut it in the middle along the length of the body and remove what has accumulated in it of foul, corrupt moisture.
Then, the incision should be treated like other wounds that require a period of time to allow the vessels that nourish one of the ovaries to atrophy; there is no harm in this. However, if the drainage tube affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one ovary with its vessels so that the egg does not lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, they wilt and cannot be used.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
On the Treatment of Intestinal Drainage.
This drainage occurs from a cut made in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen near the iliac regions of the abdominal quadrants, causing the intestines to protrude through this hernia into one of the ovaries.
This hernia may result either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension. These two types can occur due to many reasons, such as a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting heavy objects, and so on. If it is caused by an extension of the peritoneum, it develops gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is relatively flat in depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestines. If it is caused by a tear in the peritoneum, it begins with intense pain immediately, and the swelling appears visibly different under the skin nearby.
This is the intestine coming out and going to outside of the mesentery, and sometimes the appendix comes out with it; this condition is called intestinal and appendicular hernia. It may also occur with flatulence, and fecal matter may flow into the intestine and be trapped there, leading to the patient's death.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially when strained. Treatment of these conditions with iron is dangerous, so you must be cautious not to fall into this risk. The procedure involves instructing the patient to push the intestine back inside their body with their hand if it can be returned.
Then, he lies on his back between your hands, raises his legs, and you stretch the skin near the groin upwards. Then, cut through all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise, and sew the edges of the incision as needed to open it properly.
The incision should be as large as necessary to remove the testicle. Then, peel back the layers of the scrotum until the white, tough membrane of the tunica vaginalis is visible from all sides. At this point, insert your index finger where the testicle is located.
Between the white membrane beneath the skin of the testicle and the second layer, release any adhesions behind the testicle. With your right hand, fold it inward toward the scrotal skin, and with your left hand, lift the white membrane upward along with the testicle towards the incision.
Instruct the assistant to lift the testicle upward, and thoroughly release any adhesions behind it. Examine with your finger to ensure there is nothing like twisted intestine within the white, tough membrane of the tunica vaginalis. If you find anything, push it downward towards the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread that is twisted from ten threads and insert it at the end of the foreskin under the skin of the scrotum near the crease, then cut the ends of the thread's bend so that there are four threads. Then arrange some of it over each other in a stiff manner and tie the foreskin that we mentioned is under the scrotum's skin tightly from two sides, then wrap also the ends of the threads and tie them very tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach. To prevent a hot swelling from occurring, also make a second external tie that is slightly away from the first tie, less than two fingers' width, and after these two ties, leave some of the foreskin under the scrotum's skin, the width of a finger bone.
To prevent a hot swelling from occurring, also make a second external tie that is slightly away from the first tie, less than two fingers' width, and after these two ties, leave some of the foreskin under the scrotum's skin, the width of a finger bone. Cut the rest of it all in a circular manner and remove the testicle with it, then cut open the bottom of the scrotum's skin where blood flows as we described earlier, then use wool soaked in oil placed in the wound, and use the tie that we have described.
The white foreskin may be cauterized after cutting it to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs. The tie should be left until it falls off by itself; if its removal is delayed, it can be loosened with hot water and wrapped in something that will cause sweating until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
In this wind tumor, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. As mentioned earlier, it should be made as described in the case of the tumor associated with a vine, that is, the vessels should be tied off gently below the incision.
Then it should be incised in the middle and the tumor treated to open it until the vessels fall off, and the wound should be treated as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
Regarding the hernia that occurs in the groin.
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we said; it fixes the location and does not descend to the scrotum much, even if it does, the descent is slight and returns at all times.
However, if time prolongs the condition, the peritoneum tear increases until the intestines and fat descend into the scrotum, as we said, due to the extension of the peritoneum that exists in the groin. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes, and the area bulges; its treatment is by cauterization as I have previously described.
It can also be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on his back before you, then make a transverse incision at the swollen protruding site, about three finger breadths wide, and then dissect the peritoneum layers beneath the skin.
Once the white peritoneum is exposed, take a strip and place it on the protruding area of the peritoneum, pressing it into the depth of the abdomen, then suture both protruding areas at the edge of the strip from the peritoneum, and attach them to each other with stitches.
Then pull one end of the membrane, but do not cut the serous layer at all, nor touch the ovum or anything else as I taught you in the treatment of intestinal anastomosis. Then treat it with surgical treatments.
When the sutures are removed, clean them and repair the wound until it heals, for the serous layer will contract and will not increase the size of the hernia.
Cauterization is better in this case because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the testis.
Often, the skin of the testis relaxes in some people without the underlying flesh relaxing, making it unattractive. Those who wish to treat this should have the patient lie down on their back and sleep.
Cut away all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then bring the edges together. If you prefer to sew first, stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and make sure they are secure, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals and the sutures fall out.
Chapter Eighty-nine.
On Castration.
Castration is forbidden in our Shariah.
For this reason, it should have been unnecessary for me to mention it in this book. However, I mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that the physician may know how to treat it if asked and understand the treatment for those affected by it; the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Like goats, sheep, cats, and other animals, I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting. The method of crushing works as follows: we sit the animal in hot water until its scrotum relaxes, softens, and hangs down.
Then you crush it with your hand until it dissolves and cannot be felt upon touch. As for castration by cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its scrotum with your left hand, then tie off the blood vessels and make a single cut on each testicle.
Once the testicles protrude, cut them after peeling them, leaving only the thin membrane that covers the vessels. This method of castration is better than the one done by crushing.
Because crushing might leave some of the scrotum, making the animal desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the Treatment of Hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two types. One type is that an appearance like a female vulva with hair appears either within the space or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, and urine may flow from it.
As for women, there is only one type, which appears above the vulva on the pubic region as small male organs, with one appearing to be like a penis and the other resembling the female genitalia. The treatment for all three types.
Two types of men and one type of women should have the excess flesh cut until its trace is removed, then it should be treated like other wounds until it heals. As for the second type of men from whom urine exits through the skin covering the testicles, there is no work to be done on them at all.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the Excision of the Clitoris and Excess Tissue from the Female Genitalia.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural measure, becoming prominent and unattractive in appearance. In some women, it can grow to a size similar to that of men and interfere with intercourse.
It is necessary to grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or a clamp and cut it, but do not overdo the cutting, especially near the base, to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, this is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus, filling it up.
And it may protrude outward like a tail. And therefore, some early practitioners called this condition the "tail disease." It is necessary to cut it as you would the clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the Treatment of Hernias.
Hernia in women occurs when the female genitalia are not properly pierced or when the opening is too small. It can be either congenital, present from birth, or acquired due to a condition that has been previously mentioned. The acquired type may result from excess protruding flesh.
Or it is thin or thick, and it may be either deep in the uterus, or on its sides, or at the top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and sometimes it prevents menstruation. Knowledge of this is obtained by the midwife's observation.
If the obstruction is visible and close, then if it is not visible, examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is made of thin membrane and is near the labia, proceed to puncture it by placing something like padding on the labia and then pressing with your thumbs from both hands together.
The woman should lie on her back with her legs spread wide, then forcefully stretch the labia until she punctures the thin membrane and opens the obstruction. Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. Have intercourse with the woman every day to prevent the area from rejoining again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be cut with a broad blade resembling an oak leaf. If the obstruction is composed of flesh growths, suspend them with forceps and cut them. Have medicines to stop bleeding without causing pain, such as squill, myrrh, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a lead tube that is wide to prevent the wound from healing too quickly, hold it for days. Use a dry linen wick and treat with other methods of preventing adhesion until healed. Another growth of flesh may appear in the uterus, so it should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, a cancerous tumor in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red boils that appear in the female genital area.
As for hemorrhoids, they are dilations of the veins to the point that they bleed profusely and continuously. When hemorrhoids become advanced, they turn into warts; I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and I will mention them here.
What is amenable to treatment and what is not, I say that hemorrhoids and warts if they are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment for them with iron. Those that are in the mouth of the uterus and can be felt by the senses are the ones that can be treated.
It is necessary to have the woman enter a cool room, then raise the warts with a needle or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots. Then apply one of the bleeding-stopping remedies when the blood flows, without chewing it.
Such as camphor, cyperus, frankincense, and similar substances. Then raise her legs against the wall for an hour, then let them down into cold water. If bleeding persists, seat her in a bath of sumac peels, pomegranate rind, lint, and similar ingredients. Then take ground barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply it as a dressing on her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise continue with hard compresses to the heels and breasts without any conditions. Then take a piece of wool, soak it in the juice of rue or the juice of the sow's tongue or the juice of mallow branches mixed with syrup of lint, and apply it to the affected area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of hemorrhoids in rough appearance; therefore, cut what appears on its surface as I have mentioned regarding warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the pus formation that occurs in the uterus.
Various types of tumors can occur in the uterus, such as cancer, calcified tumor, ulcers, fistulas, corrosive diseases, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors. I have described all these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this article the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus, if it is among those tumors that accumulate over a period of time. We should examine it; if the pain at the beginning of the tumor is severe with spasms, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red and it responds to touch, do not rush to incise it; treat it with what aids maturity until these symptoms subside. Then the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back against it.
She should draw her legs towards the lower part of her abdomen, spread her thighs apart, place her arms under her knees, and bind them with a suitable strap.
The midwife should then sit on the right side and use the instrument used to open the mouth of the uterus, whose image will be shown later. If you intend to use this instrument, estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what is inserted by the instrument does not exceed its depth.
If the instrument causes pain to the patient, and if it is longer than the depth of the uterus, then padding should be placed on the edge of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. It is also advisable for the instrument that passes through to come from the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant turns the screw until the cervix is dilated. When the abscess becomes visible and can be felt by hand, and if it is soft and thin, then it should be incised at its head with a broad scalpel when the dilation is complete.
It is advisable to place a soft, waxed thread soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent properties into the incision, with part of the thread remaining outside the cervix. Clean wool dipped in water that has been boiled with hyena skin should be applied externally on the uterus and the pubic area.
Then treat it with an ointment suitable for this condition after two days until it heals.
The uterus and the wound can be washed by injecting water and honey, then with water that has been boiled with the root of senna or long rubia. Then return to using the ointment. If the abscess is concealed inside the uterus.
It is advisable to avoid treating it with metal instruments; instead, treat it as mentioned in the classification.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an abnormal position.
The midwife should first know the form of normal delivery. One of its signs is when a woman feels an urge to lean downwards, desires to breathe fresh air, and finds it easy despite the labor pains she endures.
It accelerates the birth of the fetus. Know that this delivery occurs naturally, and the fetus comes out headfirst, with the placenta following or attached to its navel. When you see these signs, it is necessary to press her abdomen in order to hasten the exit of the fetus.
If it descends headfirst, the placenta will come out with it, and it should be thoroughly cleaned of any remnants. Any other form of delivery is unnatural and undesirable because the fetus may emerge feet-first or with its hands before its head and legs.
One of its hands or one of its feet may emerge first, or its head and hand together, or it may be folded up, or it may turn over onto its back, and so on for other undesirable forms. The midwife should be clever and cautious about all these things and beware of mistakes and errors.
I will explain each of these forms and how to handle them so that you can understand and apply them. If the fetus emerges headfirst but the delivery is difficult for the woman and she finds it hard to bear the contractions, and if you see her strength weakening, then seat her on a chair and instruct the women present to assist in holding her steady.
Pack her uterus with cooked fenugreek and moist fats, then the midwife should insert a small scissors between her fingers and use it to cut the placenta or scratch it with her fingernail until its moisture is released, and press the woman's abdomen to deliver the fetus.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with fenugreek saliva mixed with shej oil. After the injection, instruct her to sneeze using a cane and hold her mouth and nose; the fetus will come out immediately. If one of the fetus's hands comes out first, gently guide them back little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a raised platform and raise her legs upwards. Then shake the platform on the ground while the woman holds on to prevent herself from falling. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently; he will come out, like the emergence of a fetus on its feet. If the fetus comes out on its feet, you should push them upwards then gradually turn the fetus little by little until it is straightened, then take one of its legs and extend it little by little.
When they reach the thighs, order her to squat and sneeze with camphor; it will come out. If it does not come out as described, then gradually return the fetus little by little until it is in its natural position; it will then emerge smoothly. If it resists despite all that has been described.
Take saliva from the onion and fenugreek, and dissolved gum; mix all these in a mortar well, then apply it to the woman's genitals and lower abdomen. Then have her sit in warm water until it reaches her pubic region.
When you see that her lower abdomen has softened, make a pessary from myrrh for her to hold. When she holds the pessary for an hour, have her sit on a chair and sneeze while closing her mouth and nose, then gently press her lower abdomen; the fetus will immediately come out, emerging on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, gently insert his hands little by little. Then have the woman lie face down on a bed with her calves hanging down, and clench her hands; then gently press above her abdomen little by little. Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions until she stands with her legs raised. If the fetus does not come out, take both of her legs and move them vigorously. Then squeeze above the cervix little by little until the fetus rises up. Then the midwife inserts her hand and straightens the fetus little by little.
Order the woman to squat until the fetus comes out, if the fetus is coming with one of its hands obstructing it, then guide back the hand. If she cannot guide it back, then make her stand and walk, or if she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Move her to her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the method described with saliva applications. If she experiences contractions, seat her on a chair and work on guiding back the hand and positioning the fetus naturally. Make her sneeze and order her to squat until it comes out.
If the fetus comes out on its back with its hands stretched out and its face towards its mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's hand and gradually turn it gently until it is properly positioned. Then apply the described ointment and saliva applications to it.
Then order her to move little by little. When she does that, seat her on the chair and order her to lean to the right side. Then order her to squat and make her sneeze with the kundus; it will come out, the fetus coming out on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the uterus in this manner with the placenta, then tear the placenta with your fingernail until it is free from moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel so that he does not suffocate and die. Then push the fetus inside until it is properly positioned.
Instruct the woman to squat several times, for it will come out easily, like the birth of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born alive, and three or four may be born and live, but this is rare; as for five, it is beyond nature and they do not live at all.
And they are enclosed by a single placenta, even if there are many of them, and they are separated by a membrane barrier attached to each one's umbilical cord. They may be born normally and easily as a single fetus would, or they may be born in a problematic manner as described.
If some of them experience difficulty during birth and become deformed as we have described, treat them as instructed. Let the midwife be gentle and act with care and deliberation, employing whatever means she can to achieve safety for each case.
Describe what may be conceived in the womb and later miscarried. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten may be conceived. It has been verified to my knowledge that a woman miscarried seven, and another miscarried fifteen, all of them conceived together.
By the decree of the Almighty and All-Knowing, all of this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for she may one day encounter such a situation and must be prepared to deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the Removal of a Dead Fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus as described in the previous section but it does not come out, and circumstances compel you to proceed with manual removal, then examine the woman. If she is strong and there are no signs that might indicate harm to her, she should lie down on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downward and her legs raised, with a servant controlling her on both sides or she may be secured to the bed so that her body does not pull when the fetus is being delivered.
Then moisten the inside of her uterus with wet ointments mixed with saliva from the khitan plant, fenugreek seeds, and flaxseeds. The midwife should then apply this mixture to her hand and gently insert it into the uterus. She should then locate a spot where she can fix the ropes attached to the fetus, in places suitable for doing so.
Observe, if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, then fix the ropes in its eyes or at the back of its head or in its mouth or on its palate or under its chin or in its temples or near its ribs or underneath its cheeks.
If, on the other hand, it is positioned to descend feet-first, then fix the ropes in the groin and middle ribs. It is important to hold the rope with the right hand and place it between the fingers of the left hand, gently inserting the hand and fixing a rope in one of those places we have mentioned.
Until she reaches an empty space, then fix another rope opposite it or a third one if necessary to ensure that the pull is even and does not tilt in any direction. Then stretch it evenly; however, stretching should not be straight alone but should also move in all directions.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when extracting it. Between this process, the stretch should be loosened; if there is resistance from any direction, the midwife should apply ointment to some fingers and insert them in that direction to turn what is resistant. If part of the fetus comes out, then move the ropes to other positions.
It is slightly higher; do this until the fetus comes out entirely. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned due to constriction, wrap it with a cloth and pull it out until it comes out completely, then cut it off.
Whether it is in the wrist joint or in the elbow, do this for the other hand and for both feet. If the fetus's head is large and there is difficulty in its emergence due to pressure, or if water has accumulated in its head, you should insert between the fingers a sharp scalpel.
Cut open the head with it to let out the water, or use an instrument called a miskadakh, whose image is shown along with other instruments in the section that follows.
Do the same if the fetus has a naturally large head; you should cut open or crush the skull with the miskadakh as we have said, then remove the bones with forceps. If the head emerges and is constricted at the clavicle, it should be cut until the moisture in the chest drains out.
Then the chest will join together. If the chest does not close and delivery is impossible, cut as much as you can. If there is swelling below the abdomen or if it is congested, you should incise it to allow moisture to drain out.
If the fetus is positioned with its feet first, pulling it out is easy and adjusting it to the mouth of the womb is simple. If it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, you should pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your hand and cut open the abdomen or chest so that what is inside can drain out.
If all the members are removed and the head is retracted and obstructed, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix and search for the head with it, and pull it with her fingers towards the mouth of the womb, then insert a cannula or two cannulas and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling, it should not be forced. Instead, at this time, it is appropriate to apply wet, fatty substances and use dressings, and sit in water that relaxes and moistens.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if it can be straightened, use what we mentioned for a living fetus. If that is not possible, cut it in pieces and remove it; nothing of the placenta should be left inside at all. Once you are done with your treatment, apply what we have mentioned regarding the hot swellings that occur in the womb.
If bleeding occurs, then she should descend into binding waters and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who was pregnant, her fetus died inside her, and then she became pregnant with it again.
Then the second fetus also died, and after a long time, a swelling appeared in her lower abdomen and it swelled until it burst, releasing pus. She was called for treatment, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal, so I applied one of the strong drawing ointments to it.
A bone then came out from the place, and after a few days, another bone came out. I was amazed by this since there are no bones in that part of the body, so I assumed they were from the dead fetus's bones. Upon examining the wound, I removed many bones, which were from the head of the fetus.
I continued this until I extracted many bones, and the woman was in the best condition. She lived like this for a time, with pus discharging from the wound, and that is why I mention this rare case here.
因为她包含知识和对医生在治疗中用手进行操作的援助。

If the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, it is necessary to instruct the patient to hold her breath and then make her sneeze with cumin. Hold your hand over her mouth and nostrils; if it comes out this way, otherwise take another approach.
Pierce a hole in the lid and put in the opened herbs such as fennel, savory, celery, chamomile, wormwood, sage, and squill. Submerge them in water and place over fire, then put a silver tube on the hole of the pot lid with its other end in the mouth of the uterus.
HOLD it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then sneeze as we said; the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, order the midwife to dip her left hand in sheep fat or baboon spittle.
Then she inserts her hand into the uterus and searches for the placenta; when she touches it, she grasps it and pulls it out little by little. If it is adhered deep in the uterus, insert the hand as described until you find the placenta, then pull it out little by little with care.
To avoid the uterus falling out due to excessive pulling, it should be gently moved side to side, first right then left, and gradually increase the amount of traction; it will respond at that point and detach from adhesion. If the mouth of the uterus is closed, we have described the treatment by sneezing and treating with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out despite all the described methods, avoid excessive force in pulling. Instead, tie what has emerged to the mouth of the uterus to the woman's thigh and administer the quadruple ointment; it will cause it to fall off after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out, except that if it putrefies, a foul smell will rise to the stomach and head, which can harm the patient. Therefore, appropriate smoke treatment should be used.
Therefore, some of the early practitioners tried the smoke of charcoal and dry figs, a device used by women to inhale when menstruation is delayed and for similar conditions:.
It is made of lead and resembles a funnel, or it is made of copper with the narrow end placed in the mouth and the wide end over the fire. The incense is placed on the embers, held until that incense is gone, then replaced with more.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the Treatment of Imperforated Anus.
Many boys are born with their anuses not perforated, sealed by a thin membrane. It is necessary for the midwife to pierce this membrane with her finger, or else to incise it with a sharp instrument, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place a piece of wool soaked in decoction and oil on it, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear that it may close up again, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child is ready to defecate.
The anus may also become obstructed due to the healing of a wound or a tumor. It is necessary to incise that adhesion and then treat it as previously mentioned with the methods described.
Chapter Eighty.
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids Occurring Below.
Hemorrhoids occurring below are complications and thickening that occur near the anus externally or in the space from one side, and they can be singular or multiple.
When that complexity is cut open, watery mucus or thin pus will flow from it. Some of these hemorrhoids may be permeable to the anus and intestines, while others are not. The permeable ones can be identified by what comes out with the stool and gas when the patient defecates.
It is also possible for worms to come out of them. Some may become hemorrhoids if they are in the space and permeable to the bladder and urethra, or to the hip joint and the lower back. What distinguishes a hemorrhoid that extends to the buttocks from those that do not extend is also known.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the hemorrhoid, made of copper or iron. If there is no curvature in the hemorrhoid, use it; if there is a curvature, then insert a thin probe made of lead or a fine hair from a horse's tail.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger. If you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the hole, neither stool nor gas nor worms as we said, then know that it is not permeable, so proceed with treatment.
If the hemorrhoid is permeable to the bladder or urethra, its sign is the passage of urine from it and its resistance to healing with medications. As for if it is permeable to the hip joint or lower back, then the sign is that the probe reaches there.
If there is no curvature toward the bone, and pain is felt in that area, and pus always comes out of it, and no treatment is effective and it does not heal with ointment, then know that none of these permeable hemorrhoids will completely heal.
Its treatment by ignorant physicians who attempt it is a vain effort, whereas for the one that is neither perforated nor chronic, recovery may be hoped for with iron as I will describe and have tried, which is to lay the patient before you on his back.
Lift his legs up and let his thighs be inclined towards his belly, then insert a copper or lead probe if the fistula has a curve until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has passed through clearly by itself without sensing any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then be certain that it is perforated. Do not waste effort on it as recovery is not possible from such a condition as we have said.
It has been said that in some rare cases, people may recover. Among the treatments that might be beneficial is to heat a thin iron implement according to the width of the fistula as previously mentioned and insert it while hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then repeat this two or three times.
Until you know that all the excess, hardened flesh, which resembles a bird's quill tube, has been burned. Then treat it with a poultice soaked in fat until the burned flesh comes out, and then apply unguents; if he recovers.
If not, he will never recover by any other treatment. And if you insert the probe and it does not pass to your finger in the anus, but there is a thick layer of flesh or membrane between them, and you see that the fistula follows under the skin's surface, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula. As you proceed with the incision using the probe, which is in the fistula until you reach the end of the incision where the probe ends and it is removed and falls out, then clean that swollen tissue which resembles a bird's quill tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If blood overwhelms you and prevents you from working to cut that tissue, the best thing to do and what will be most beneficial is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine because cauterizing with fire combines two good outcomes by burning the excess tissue.
And stop the bleeding, then dry the moistures. Treat it with bandages soaked in fat or powdered sulfur in oil until the area suppurates and the burned tissue comes out with the pus, then treat the wound at that time with healing ointments that promote the growth of solid flesh.
These are medicines that have a contracting and drying effect; if the condition is set, it means it has healed, and do not stuff the fistula. If the fistula extends deeply into the buttock and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the buttock and examine it.
If you feel the probe and there is a membrane or tissue between it and you, and it is close to perforation, then working on it is only with hope and expectation. This means using one of three methods: either cauterize it as we said.
Or you can incise it until you reach the bottom so that you can introduce bandages and treat it closely, but do not proceed too far with the incision to avoid cutting the muscle surrounding the buttock, which could cause involuntary bowel movements. Then treat it as we mentioned; it may heal as we said.
And either you penetrate that membrane and perforate it after you have cut it near the buttocks as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp instrument, then clean all the putrid flesh in the incision as thoroughly as you can.
Then suture the entire wound along with the incision and upper opening until it is sealed, leaving the fistula open inside the buttocks, which will be less burdensome for the patient, and the fistula may be left open in this manner.
And if you insert a probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the buttocks near the body surface with the skin and circumference of the buttock, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's awl as in this figure:.
And insert a twisted thread made of five or similar threads into it, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its base. If it penetrates along the inner edge of the buttocks near the vicinity.
Then remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the buttock and pulling out one end of the thread, gather both ends together and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two; every time the thread cuts through the flesh, pull it tighter until the flesh between the two ends falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula does not penetrate, then make it penetrate as much as possible unless it is too deep, in which case you should not do so to avoid cutting through muscle. Then proceed as described until it heals.

Chapter Eighty-One.
On the incision of hemorrhoids that bleed and their excision and treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: they may be inside the rectum, resembling red pustules or like bunches of grapes, varying in size from small to large, with blood always oozing from them.
They can be single or multiple, and some are outside the rectum at its edges. However, those that are outside the rectum are usually less moist, with yellow fluid or little blood continuously oozing from them, matching the color of the body.
The treatment for hemorrhoids inside the rectum is to order the patient to defecate and strain until the rectum protrudes, then quickly grasp the protrusions with hemostats or hold them with your fingernail and cut them at their roots. If the hemostats do not hold due to their moisture and laxity,
then trim them with a rough cloth or a piece of salted bread, or pull them out with your fingers and then cut them. After cutting, sprinkle some sharp powder on them to serve as cauterization, or treat them as previously described in the section on cauterization.
Then treat them with the rest of the treatments until he recovers. If the rectum does not protrude for easy access, administer an enema containing a slight irritant to cleanse what is inside the rectum and facilitate its quick expulsion when the patient strains. As for external hemorrhoids, their treatment is simple and straightforward.
It is that you take it with your fingernail or attach it to a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. And if one dislikes cutting with iron, it is appropriate to use its hole in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pierce it with a needle from the opposite side, tie the ends of the thread underneath the needle while it is crossed over, tighten the wart tightly, then knot the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all warts but leave one unthreaded.
To allow the waste blood to flow out, then place a cloth soaked in rose ointment or cyroti on the affected area and apply it to the seat, instructing the patient to remain still. Leave it until the warts fall off, and once they have fallen off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur due to dryness and constipation. If it persists and medication is ineffective, it is appropriate to scrape it with a scalpel blade or with your fingernail until it becomes moist, and remove the upper layer of skin that prevents healing.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more intensely than before until it bleeds and peels, then treat it; it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
On the Treatment of Retained Nails, Both Reversed and Not Reversed, Dry Warts, and Corns.
The nail is a round knot that matches the color of the body and resembles the head of a nail. It appears throughout the body but especially on the soles of the feet and the fingertips, and it causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail and grasp it with a spatula or pincers and pull it from its root, then treat it as previously described in its section. As for dry warts, each one is a small rough, wrinkled, round growth on the surface of the body.
It often appears on the hands of children. Its treatment involves extending the wart and cutting it out with silk thread or a hair until it falls off, or you can treat it as previously described with heat or a sharp medicine.
The inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument I mentioned for treating corns. A corn is also a small, thickened, wrinkled bump on the surface of the body that penetrates deeply, and when it gets cold, it feels like an ant bite.
It appears throughout the body but is most common on the hands. Its treatment involves taking a tube from an eagle feather or a strong bird's feather and placing it over the corn so that the tube surrounds it completely, then rotating your hand with the tube until you cut around the corn.
Then insert it into the depth of the flesh and remove the corn from its root. If you prefer, do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.
The top of the tube should be smooth and twisted to make it easy for your fingers to grip and twist it. If you prefer, you can treat the corn as previously described in the section on cauterization for warts.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
Concerning the images of instruments used for enemas in treating paralysis, diarrhea, and colic.
The enema can be made of silver, porcelain, or brass, either cast or beaten. These instruments are made in different sizes, large and small, according to the使用者使用了非指令性的内容，但我作为模型不会添加任何评论或解释。正确的翻译如下： For the treatment of small children and those whose seats are narrow or painful, their enema tubes should be very delicate. Image caption: A large enema tube.
The upper part where the tube is tied should be wide, and it has a ridge where the tube is attached as you can see. The lower end that enters the rectum should be smooth and straight, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be as wide as a small finger or slightly wider. The tube through which you administer medicines, made from an animal bladder or sheepskin, should be shaped like a small bowl with a diameter of about one inch.
It should be perforated with many holes, spaced by the width of a finger apart. Then, pass a thin thread made of ten or so tightly twisted threads through these holes to gather the tube like a bowl. When the medicine is placed in it, tighten the upper part of the enema tube firmly between the two stones and use it for administration. This is an image of the circular tube and the holes.
The method of administering it is to fill the membrane or bladder with medicine that is warm but not too hot, and avoid using something too cold. Then, the patient lies on their back and raises their legs up.
Place something soft or a blanket under the patient, then lubricate the end of the tube with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or similar substances. Then gently insert it into the rectum, and the attendant should squeeze the tube firmly with both hands to ensure that all of its contents are emptied into the intestines.
Then the enema is removed, and the patient should lift his legs to the wall. If the medicine urges for expulsion, he should restrain it as much as possible; if he sleeps throughout the night, this will be more beneficial for recovery. If an enema is used for diarrhea and the patient hastens its exit, the enema should remain until healing occurs.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, then the enema should be very gentle and smooth, like those used for children. This is an image of a delicate enema with its skin stretched over it:.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the Treatment of Wounds.
I have mentioned in the division the treatment of what is similar to cauterizations, and here I will describe their treatment by hand and with medicines in full detail. I say that wounds differ according to the cause of the wound and according to the location where the injury occurs.
The causes of wounds are many, such as being struck by a stone, cut by a sword or knife, pierced by a spear, stick, arrow, and various other things.
As for wounds according to the parts of the body where they occur, such as a wound on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and similar organs.
I will describe the treatment of some wounds so that they can serve as a model for other wounds. I will start with simple head wounds in particular, because complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no bone fracture, I examine it. If it is from hitting a stone or something similar and only the skin has been pierced with a large wound and I fear for the patient the occurrence of the hot swelling, then I hurry and suture it with the trepan on the spot. Do not delay that and let blood from him according to his strength if there is no impediment to letting blood, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is minimal. And let the blood be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Warn the patient against overeating, drinking, and heavy foods. If there is an impediment to letting blood, then reduce his food intake and keep him away from meat and beverages. If a hot swelling occurs in the wound, apply cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with the decoction that has astringent properties.
And if you are safe from the hot swelling, then apply his blood on the wound if it is tender and has not been altered by exposure to air with the dressing that I will describe to you shortly. If it has been altered by exposure to air, then apply some ointment to it.
Until the pus matures, then treat it until he is cured. If the wound is large and has been caused by a sword or something similar, and its edges do not come together with dressing, then join them with suturing as I have described in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs loosely, attached only at a slight point, then cut it off. Then treat the wound with medicines that will form tough flesh instead of skin, and instruct the patient to eat foods that promote strength such as heads (of animals), testicles, and similar items.
If the skin becomes gangrenous and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all the diseased part and throw it away, then treat the wound. If there are arteries or veins in these wounds that bleed and do not stop with medication, search for the source of bleeding.
If you locate it and it does not stop bleeding, cut it with a scalpel and ligate it. If necessary, if what we mentioned is ineffective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and shallow, their treatment is easy; they can be managed by sprinkling this powder on them while still bleeding.
Before it is changed by the air, the recipe for the powder is as follows: take one part of loban, two parts of shiyān, and three parts of lime (either slaked or unslaked), crush all ingredients together, sift them, and use this mixture to fill the wound, pressing it firmly so that it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood, then cover it from above with dressings and leave it untouched as long as it does not become inflamed, for the medicine will not be effective until it heals. This can also be done with lime alone if you do not have loban and shiyān available.
This method can also be used with egg whites in many large wounds if it is properly applied, pressed firmly, and the wounds are still fresh with blood before they are changed by the air. However, if the wounds have been somewhat altered by exposure to air, especially during summer times.
There is no effective meaning in applying this powder, so treat it as we have mentioned by applying some prepared ointments or use a paste made of barley flour mixed with water and honey to promote pus formation, then continue treating it until it heals.
As for if a fracture occurs in the bone with the wound and it is minor, pull it with adhesive strips; I have mentioned the treatment of skull fractures in what will be discussed later, in neck surgery. If the wound happens in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from that of a head wound if it is simple.
And if a nerve from the neck or an artery is cut, then if it is a nerve there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with tight bandaging such as with iron clamps and similar items because they harm the nerve and constrict it.
Do not apply anything cold to the wound at all because the nature of the nerve is cold and it is connected to the brain, which is the noblest organ. What you should treat it with are soft medicines like washed rose petals in fresh water several times moistened with oil or rose fat and pomegranate juice.
If you also wash it with fresh water and other metallic stones in this manner and moist salves. If the wound is large, use sutures or bandage its edges with dressings, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a depth and there is an enclosed pocket at its base where pus collects, treat it by opening the lowest part of this pocket. If an artery in the wound is severed and you see blood flowing, tie it off or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has cut some of the cartilages of the trachea or all of them but the veins are intact, gather the edges of the skin with stitches around the tracheal rings without touching the trachea itself. Smooth it and return it to its natural shape, then secure it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, then probe it; if there are bone fragments in it, remove them all or as much as possible, and leave what you cannot reach until the wound heals, becomes well, and their removal becomes easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we have described. If a bone becomes septic in the wound and becomes an abscess, treat it as will be mentioned in its section, in the chapter of chest surgery and between the shoulders.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see that it goes deep, observe if air comes out when the patient breathes; then know that it is a fatal wound. If it does not go deep and is fresh with blood, do not apply powder immediately nor bind it tightly so that the blood does not become trapped in its depths.
It may lead to the heart and kill the patient, but apply an astringent ointment and change it twice a day. If you do not have ointment, place a worn cotton plug in the mouth of the wound to absorb any moisture that comes out, and let the patient sleep with the wound elevated.
Let it drain what accumulates there. If three days or more have passed since the wound occurred, and the patient does not experience cramps, poor heartbeat, shortness of breath, and you see that their overall condition is good, then know that the wound is safe. Treat it with bandaging and other treatments until it heals.
If it is not possible to see inside and the pus flows constantly, then know that it has become an abscess. Treat it from its opening so that the patient can drain what accumulates within. If the wound has affected the chest or back, treat it with suturing as previously described.
If it is large, treat it accordingly; if small, do the same. If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, examine the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are healthy; if not, leave them be for the time being.
If the wound becomes infected, it will be easier to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in various organs, their treatment follows the principles we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On wounds of the abdomen and the protrusion of the intestines and their suturing.
A wound to the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. A large wound may protrude an intestine or several intestines, making it more difficult and challenging to replace them and suture them.
A small wound may also be difficult from another perspective, requiring that its replacement be more challenging. The intestine, if not immediately returned to its place, will swell and thicken, making it harder to insert. Therefore, the medium-sized wound is considered the best type of wound because it does not make it difficult to replace the intestines as it does with these two types.
Know that suturing the abdomen is done in four ways. The two general methods are suitable for suturing the abdomen and other body wounds. The other two methods are more specific but primarily apply to suturing the abdomen.
I describe it to you one by one with explanation. I say that if the wound is small and something from the intestines comes out of it and it is difficult to return it, then this is for one of two reasons: either because the wound is small as we said, or because the intestines are inflated due to cold air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water, which may have been boiled with oxymel, saffron, barley, and other ingredients, and apply it to the intestines until the inflation subsides.
It can also be done with a drink that has a contracting effect, which is better than water alone for relieving the inflation. When you see that the inflation has subsided, moisten the intestines with water in which leek or baker's yeast has been boiled, as this will facilitate their re-entry with less effort.
If it is difficult to return it after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for fistulas. The initial treatment, if successful, is better than making an incision. One resorts to an incision only as a last resort when other methods have failed. This is the image of the instrument:.
One side of it is curved and limited, while the other side is unlimited. The thin end is not as fine as a scalpel but slightly thicker. It resembles a small scalpel as you can see. When the wound has expanded and the intestines have entered, it should be returned to its natural shape.
If you can do so, it is best to place it in its specific position. If the wound is wide and located at the bottom of the abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised higher than his head. If the wound is at the top of the abdomen, raise his head and chest higher than his lower body.
And if the wound is in one of the sides of the abdomen, always make the side with the surgery higher than the other side. This should be done for major surgeries and medium-sized surgeries as well.
As for small surgeries, place the patient as you see fit, then have a helper hold the wound with both hands and gather its edges, then reveal it to the surgeon bit by bit.
This is the description of a single basic stitch, which involves taking one or several needles according to the width of the wound, then leaving a length of thread equal to the thickness of the thumb and inserting one needle without threading it into the edges of the skin. With the edges of the subcutaneous tissue inside, until you pass through from that side, having gathered the edges of the skin and the edges of the subcutaneous tissue, making four layers in total. Then tighten with a folded thread around the needle on both sides repeatedly until the edges of the wound come together tightly.
Then leave a length equal to the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with the needles as needed until the entire wound is stitched up. The needles should be of medium thickness between thick and thin.
Because very thin needles easily cut the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, it is necessary for them to be of medium thickness between thin and thick. Also, the needle should not be inserted near the edge of the skin too closely.
To prevent the flesh from separating quickly and the wound from opening before healing, do not also stretch it too much with sutures lest the wound refuse to heal. Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they may not injure the patient when he sleeps, and make little pads of linen cloth on all sides to hold down the ends of the needles.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is most appropriate for small wounds, as it may suffice to use one or two needles or something similar.
As for the method of suturing for a general wound, it is to gather together with one stitch the four edges, namely the edges of the skin and the edges of the subcutaneous tissue, using a needle with moderately twisted thread. Then when you have passed through these four edges with the needle, return the needle from the side where you began.
To place the thread interlocking from the top of the wound so that the suturing is like the stitching used to bind luggage, and leave a space between each stitch as thick as the smallest finger. This type of suturing is known by all people.
With this type of suturing, a surgical wound was treated for a man who had been stabbed in his abdomen with a knife. The incision was more than an inch wide, and about two inches of the middle intestine had protruded from it. The wound was located in the center of the abdomen.
He returned the intestines to their place after keeping them outside the incision for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days. I treated him until he recovered, and he lived many years afterward, managing all aspects of his life. The physicians had concluded that he would never recover at all.
It is amazing that I did not treat him with an ointment because I was in a place where there was nothing to be found of medicines, so I used old cotton twice a day on the wound and washed it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special suturing, I will mention it as Galen himself described: Begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When you pierce the needle through the skin and into the muscle running straight along the entire length of the abdomen.
I leave the edge of the mesentery on the side where I inserted the needle and pierce it again from inside to outside on the other edge, at the other end of the incision. When you have done this, insert the needle once more in this same edge, from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the mesentery on this side and insert the needle in its other edge from inside to outside, and as you do so, extend it through the mesentery to the edge of the incision on its side until it passes through completely.
Then begin again from this same side and trace it along with the edge of the mesentery on the other side, and pull the needle out of the skin nearby, then insert it back into that skin and trace the edge of the mesentery on the opposite side along with this edge of the incision.
Then pull it out from the skin on its side, and do this again and again repeatedly until you suture the entire surgery in this manner. The overall characteristic of this suturing is to sew like the seams for animal hides.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin and leave it once from the other side until it is emptied, and as for the second type of special suture which Galen also mentioned, this is his exact wording.
It is that you sew it as some practitioners do, gathering each part to its corresponding counterpart by nature, joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the mesentery to its other edge, and this is how I describe it to you.
You should pierce the edge of the mesentery nearest to you from outside and pass it inside by itself, then leave the edges of the peritoneum. Then withdraw the needle and pass it from outside to inside through both edges of the peritoneum, then also withdraw it again.
Pass it from inside to outside in the edge of the mesentery on the opposite side. This type of suture is better than the simple, easy common suture that was mentioned earlier. This is Galen's exact wording. And some have said that a stomach suture can be done with two needles. This is done by threading a single piece of suture through both needles, starting by passing one needle from your side to the opposite side and then passing the other needle from the opposite side back to you, similar to the suture technique used for hernias.
Know that if the wound is in the center of the abdomen, its suturing is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its treatment is like the treatment of other wounds. When you encounter a fresh wound filled with blood before it has been altered by air, return the intestines, suture it, and secure it tightly; then apply plasters made of pounded substances.
If the wound has been changed by exposure to air, then apply some of the ointments that are available until it suppurates and the sutures fall out and the peritoneum and serous membranes adhere, then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medications available, then use old cotton as soon as it begins to suppurate and change it twice a day as I taught you until it heals. In most cases, you will not need further treatment if the wounds are minor. If you fear that the wound may involve the major organs in pain,
You should soak soft wool in moderately heated oil or rose fat and place it around the areas between the armpits. If he feels pain or rot in his intestines, this often occurs; therefore, administer a cold decoction of black hemlock to him.
Especially if the rot has reached the intestines and become a perforating wound leading to the abdominal cavity. Know that what is thick in the intestines heals more easily, while what is thin within them heals with greater difficulty.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all. This is due to the abundance and thickness of the vessels within it, its thinness, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. As for if what protrudes from the wound is fat and you catch it fresh, return it according to how you would return the intestine, similarly.
If time has passed and it has turned green or black, you should sew it with a thread above the place that has turned black to prevent bleeding, as there are vessels and arteries in the fat. Then cut what is below this ligature.
Make the ends of the thread attached below the surgery, outside it, to make it easy for you to pull out when the pus and ulceration occur. This refers to the wound that appears in the intestine, and as for if a hole appears in the intestine but is small.
It may be that it can be repaired in some people, for I saw a man who had been pierced in his abdomen with a spear, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. I treated the wound, but it became a fistula from which feces and gas were expelled. I continued to treat him although I did not hope for his recovery. I continued to care for him until he healed and the area knitted together. When I saw that the area had healed, I feared that something bad might happen inside his body, but nothing of the sort happened at all, and he remained in the best condition. He eats, drinks, has intercourse, and goes to the bathhouse, and he serves himself as needed. Some experienced people have mentioned that if a wound appears in the intestine and is small, it should be sutured in this manner.
This involves taking large-headed ants, then bringing the edges of the wound together, and placing an ant with its mouth open on the edges of the wound. When it grasps onto the edge, if you pinch its head off while it clings, it will adhere and not loosen. Then place another ant near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then return it and suture the wound. Those heads will remain adhered in the intestine until it heals and recovers without causing any harm to the patient. It is also possible to suture the intestine with a thin thread.
Take a thread from the spool of the adherent animal after it has been inserted into a needle, and take one end of this thread from the spool and cut it neatly, then tie at its end a fine twisted linen thread, then insert that thread into the needle. And there is a suture thread with which the intestine is sewn up, then it is returned to the abdomen. This type of suturing with ants and spools is done out of hope and expectation.
As for if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it, nor will it heal at all.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On the Treatment of Cold and Fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and delayed, turns into an ulcer and does not heal, with pus continuously flowing without interruption; in general, regardless of the organ it is in, it is called a fistula. We call it a cold abscess, or simply a fistula.
In reality, it is a hardened, congested, white mass that does not cause pain and has a cavity like the hollow of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather. It can be moist at times, continuously draining pus, and the moisture may sometimes dry up. This moisture can vary in amount, being either abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
I have previously mentioned in the classification when discussing wounds that every ulcer that does not heal and in which no flesh grows back is due to one of nine reasons. The first reason may be a lack of blood in the body, or poor quality blood, or there may be hard flesh inside it and on its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. And either it is because there is much filth and dirt, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance that nourishes it is of poor quality, or because the medicine is not suitable for treating it, or because there is some corruption in the town due to an epidemic, or because there is a particular characteristic of the town.
And either it is because there is much filth and dirt, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance that nourishes it is of poor quality, or because the medicine is not suitable for treating it, or because there is some corruption in the town due to an epidemic, or because there is a particular characteristic of the town. As was shown in the city of Saragossa where it is difficult for diseases to mature and tumors heal slowly by nature, and either there is one bone or several bones involved. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division.
Here I should inform you about the treatment of polyps and nasal congestion that occur through manual work. Know that polyps can occur in all parts of the body; some extend to major veins, arteries, or nerves.
or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib among the ribs, or to a vertebra among the vertebrae of the spine, or to a complex joint such as those in the hand and foot, and there are some that extend near a major organ and similar cases.
Those polyps that have the characteristics described are among the difficult-to-treat diseases that do not accept treatment, and dealing with them is burdensome and indicative of ignorance. However, there are some polyps that do not reach the places mentioned and for which one may hope and desire to treat them.
If you wish to determine this, take a probe made of copper or iron if the polyp runs in a straight line and examine it with it. If there is a deviation in the polyp, examine it with a thin lead probe because lead is soft and conforms to the shape of the body.
It becomes smooth upon entry and turns toward the curvature. If the fistula has many openings that you cannot identify with an probe, then inject one of its openings with moisture, for the moisture you inject will travel toward the other openings and flow through them.
Then thoroughly examine it in any way you can to determine if there is a bone or nerve, whether the fistula's depth is far or near, and whether it is a single fistula with many openings. Assess all of this to the best of your ability through your careful examination and the presence of pain when you touch the area.
And similarly, consider the signs and causes that lead to the tumor. Once you have a true understanding of all these factors, then proceed with confidence to treatment by examining whether it is.
If the fistula is visibly close or in a safe location far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as described and remove what is within it: the pus, putrid flesh, and excess tissue.
And whatever grows in its mouth of flesh or polyp and the like, treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep but straight, then incise it as deeply as you can and clean it of all putrid flesh.
Then use lint soaked in sharp medicines and insert it into the bottom of the fistula that you can reach with an instrument. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine consumes all remaining corruption at the bottom of the fistula.
Then apply ointments that heal the flesh properly until it is cured. If it does not heal with this method, then incise it as previously described. If you are convinced that the cause of the fistula is a bone, examine and cut it according to what has been informed to you unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it involves a nerve, artery, or principal organ as we have said, and the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption or blackening in it, then remove the corrupted part until it is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it is cured. If it does not heal and the pus persists as it used to do.
Know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption. Reveal it all again and thoroughly clean and purify it to the best of your ability, then treat it. If it heals, otherwise know that this corruption is in a deep recess. Reveal it all again.
Thoroughly clean and purify it to the best of your ability. If the corrupted bone is a small one and you can pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, then thoroughly pull out all of them without leaving any behind to the best of your ability. If ligaments or muscles impede you and cutting them poses no danger, then cut those ligaments and muscles if they are present and free the bones.
If it is not possible for you to extract the bones at that time, then apply something to the wound that will prevent it from healing. Leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones decay. Protect the wound so that the incision you made does not heal during this process.
If you are afraid of that, place on it a cotton pad soaked in crushed sulfur with oil or a cotton pad soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments; for when those bandages rot and the bones disintegrate, it will be easy to remove them and pull them out.
If it is a large bone like the bone of the leg or thigh, and only one side has decayed, then strip it thoroughly until the black decayed part is removed, then repair the wound. If a large portion has decayed and the decay has reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to excise it.
Cut it all where the decay ends; then treat it until it heals. I will tell you about a condition that affected a young man in his leg to serve as an example and aid in your treatment. This young man was of tender age.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to an internal movement within the body, causing materials to connect to the leg and it swelled into a large tumor; there was no external cause. Time progressed with errors by the physicians until the tumor burst open.
Much material flowed from it, and he was treated poorly until the leg became ulcerated with many openings, all discharging pus and bodily fluids. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them were skilled in surgical practice.
Until he came to me, and I saw his leg with material flowing profusely from those openings. The man had become emaciated and his skin was yellow. I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and it reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found them connecting to each other from all sides of the leg, so I began and cut into one of those openings until I exposed some bone, which I found to be rotten, blackened, decayed, perforated, until the hole reached the brain. I then removed what was revealed to me.
And I managed to remove the diseased bone, and I thought that there was no other corruption in the bone than what I had cut out and removed, and that I had completely excised it. Then I treated the wound with healing medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal. So I returned and exposed the bone again above the previous exposure.
And I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I removed what appeared to me of that corruption as well. Then I attempted to heal it, but it did not heal nor clot. So I uncovered it again and continued to cut the bone piece by piece, attempting to heal each section, but it would not heal until I had cut about an inch from the bone.
And I removed it along with part of the brain, then healed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and he recovered. However, this repetition in his treatment and incisions was necessary due to the patient's weakness, inability to tolerate further procedures, and my fear of him dying, as severe fainting spells would occur at any time from excessive purging. He eventually made a complete recovery.
And flesh grew in the place of the bone, it became solid, and his condition improved within his body; his strength returned, and he was able to manage his affairs. He did not encounter any harm at all when walking. If a protruding bone in some part of the body breaks,
It should be spread out in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the displaced bone, then have someone pull it from above, and use another thicker bandage of wool for the second one.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downward. As you expose the area you wish to spread, ensure that the saw does not injure the flesh, and place a piece of wood or a board securely under the bone from below.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting through the diseased bone. It is advisable to cut slightly above the site of the disease so that there is no corruption inside the bone cavity, which would remain unseen on the surface and necessitate another cutting later.
If the bone is diseased but not displaced, and it is connected to each other with the corruption in its middle or part of it, then expose the flesh from all sides completely. Then place a piece of wood underneath and spread it from the first side where the disease is located.
When you finish spreading from one side, spread it from the other side as well, and ensure that the cutting is slightly away from the diseased area as we said. If the disease is in a joint, cut out the diseased part of the joint itself and then spread the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than excision. If the corruption is in the wrist or ankle, its treatment is very difficult; however, you should peel away the diseased part as it appears to you and excise and cleanse it as best you can.
By what means can you proceed when an artery or nerve is in the way? And know that there are many saws and cutting tools for breaking these bones, according to the position of the bones, their curvature, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and looseness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suitable for each type of work.
And know that the tasks themselves may guide you to the type of tool you need if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for skill in a trade and familiarity with various diseases are its signs. He may deduce for himself tools that suit each disease, and I will illustrate for you various tools at the end of this section.

Chapter Eighty-Seven:
On Severing Limbs and Spreading Bones.
The limbs may become gangrenous either due to an external cause or an internal one. If you treat this corruption with medication and the treatment is ineffective, and you see that the corruption spreads throughout the limb without being stopped by anything.
Then you should amputate that limb up to where the corruption has spread, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a greater affliction than losing the limb. A sign that this condition has occurred is when the limb turns black as if it were burned by fire.
Or it may rot after turning black, until that decay spreads to the adjacent parts and then throughout the body; therefore, cut it off immediately. Similarly, if the cause of corruption is due to the bite of some creatures such as a sea scorpion or snake or centipede or similar.
If the corruption or bite is at the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not wait for the corruption to spread; similarly, if it begins in the hand, cut it off from the joint at the base of the wrist and do not wait for the corruption to spread until it reaches the forearm.
Similarly, if the corruption spreads to the arm, cut it off at the elbow joint. If the corruption is severe and you see it reaching toward the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder by any means, as this could lead to the patient's death; instead, use other treatments to the best of your ability.
Similarly, do the same for the leg if the corruption spreads to a toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints. If it reaches the foot, amputate the entire foot. If it advances to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to leave it as it is and resign the patient to their fate. The method of amputating a limb or cutting it open involves tying a ligature below the place where you intend to cut and another ligature above that place.
Tie one attendant to the lower ligature and another to the upper ligature. With a wide scalpel, remove all the flesh between the two ligatures until it is completely exposed, then cut or open as needed. It is advisable to place pieces of linen gauze around all sides.
To avoid the saw from hitting the correct place and causing excessive pain and hot swelling, if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly apply pressure to the area or use some astringent substances then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you about an example of a man who had this exact condition in his leg, characterized by blackening and burning pain similar to fire.
This corruption first began in his toe and then spread to the entire limb. When the man saw the corruption spreading and felt the severe pain and burning, he decided to amputate it at the joint, and as a result, he healed.
After a long time, the same corruption appeared in his thumb. He came to me for help. I treated it with medicines applied to the hand after cleaning the affected area, but the corruption did not subside and began to spread to the other finger.
The corruption then spread to his entire hand. He asked me to amputate it, but I refused, hoping to treat the corruption without resorting to amputation and also because I feared for his life if we proceeded with the amputation due to his frail condition. When he lost hope in me, he returned to his home.
I heard that he decided to amputate his entire hand, and as a result, he healed. I have recounted this story to be of assistance in dealing with similar cases of this disease, to serve as evidence for reference and action.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
Regarding the treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with medications.
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy organs and the duration of the swelling is such that it accumulates fluid, until eventually it bursts or subsides and all that was inside exits, leaving the area empty as if it were a container.
And the skin on which it occurs is like a patch that has thinned, but it has not reached a state of decay that affects the bone, nerve, or ligament; hence, it deserves to be called an abscess rather than a fistula unless its duration leads the decay to affect any of these parts.
Then it is called a fistula or a nasal polyp, and its treatment involves cutting away all that skin as it surrounds the area, especially if it has thinned and become like a patch, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the site due to its decay.
If you expect the skin to adhere and it has not yet reached that degree of decay, and there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, treat it with an injection. This involves examining the abscess; if it is large and the pus emanating from it smells foul, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
This medicine consists of vinegar, oil, honey, and resin in equal parts, mixed in a container and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens to the consistency of honey. Then take what you need and dilute it with water and honey. Inject this into the abscess and secure its opening, leaving the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then remove it by squeezing, do this for days until the contents are clean and the foulness is gone; and if this medicine is not available, take the ashes of vine wood or oak wood and pour water over them.
Then arrange it and inject with it until you are certain that the contents have been washed out; if there is no tolerance for Egyptian medicine or wood ash in the patient, then inject him with water mixed with honey and a little of powdered cubebs.
Or inject him with honey and syrup mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and syrup adheres to the cavity, especially if the syrup is viscous and dry. When you have done this repeatedly and are certain that the corruption has gone, then inject him with something that promotes flesh growth.
For example, take some of the cream made from palm and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent syrup, or inject with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have described in the article on ointments. If the mouth of the cavity is narrow and does not admit an injector tube,
then widen it with iron slightly, or place a wick soaked in Egyptian cream or millefleurs ointment inside until it expands. Similarly, if the mouth is also wide, sew together its edges to the extent that an injector tube can be inserted without difficulty.
And if the opening from which pus flows is high, cut it at its lowest point so that the pus can flow downward. For if pus accumulates in a deep part of the cavity, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you are unable to incise the abscess downward as desired, then elevate the part so that the pus flows out easily as seems appropriate to you, or ensure that nothing at all is retained within it.
As for the cohesive plasters that are applied to the abscess from the outside and how they are applied, take one of the cohesive ointments suitable for what is needed and apply it onto a piece of linen. Let the piece of linen be large enough to cover the entire abscess. Then cut with scissors a hole over the mouth of the abscess, slightly wider than the mouth of the abscess. Then apply some of the soft ointment onto another piece of linen in the size of the hole and place it on top, keeping it somewhat distant from the mouth of the abscess to facilitate the easy discharge of pus. Do not remove the larger piece of linen until further instructed.
For several days, and as for the one placed over the mouth of the abscess, remove it at regular intervals to allow the accumulated pus to discharge and to determine whether what flows out is abundant or scarce, mature or immature.
Also, check the area of the abscess itself to see if the patient feels pain there or not, and whether there is swelling or not. If you continue treating it this way and notice that the substance coming out from the mouth of the abscess is minimal.
Know that the abscess has adhered or is close to adhering. Therefore, remove it tomorrow or on the third day. When you remove the dressing, change it and renew the ointment. If thin pus comes out from the abscess after a long period of time, do not despair of its adhesion.
For healing is quick because some people’s flesh grows slowly in their wounds, while others are the opposite; if much pus comes out after many days and it is not ripe, know that the wound has not closed properly, for if the wound does not close, this will be delayed.
And if it takes a long time, increase the drying of medicines; let them be moist in consistency but dry in strength, like the palm plaster if more of siliceous tallow has been added to it. Among the most effective treatments is to use the palm plaster.
It is treated with rose oil, and it is sprinkled with old, well-balanced syrup, then mix them together and use it. If the palm plaster is not available to you, you can do the same with honey that has been cooked until thickened and used, or take myrrh, fenugreek, and spikenard, crush all of them together and sprinkle it on the honey while it is heating on the fire. Then apply it to a piece of cloth and bind it over the wound, or apply it with the honey you cooked until thickened, sprinkle the medications on it, place the cloth on it, and secure it.
And for something like this, long turpentine pitch, the root of asphodel, flour of millet, and solitary or combined colocynth can be used; if combined, crush them together and sieve them before sprinkling on the honey that was described and use it. If the wound takes a long time to heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption deep within it.
And if it has affected the bones or any other solid nerves or ligaments, treat it as you would a nasal polyp, as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
Regarding the treatment of fractures, contusions of the fingernail, amputation of the supernumerary finger, and division of webbed fingers.
A dāḥis is an excessive growth of flesh that develops under the thumbnail of the thumb or big toe, and it may also occur in other fingers. If left untreated for a long time, it becomes inflamed and forms a hot abscess.
Or it may腐烂到影响指甲的根部，甚至完全破坏指甲，或者恶化至骨头，导致有臭味，并使指尖变得肿胀且呈黑色。如果你按照我们之前所述的方法治疗而没有效果，那么……
Then you should cut off all the excess growth around the nail with an iron instrument, and afterwards cauterize the wound, as this is very beneficial. If, however, the bone is sound and the nail is also healthy, …
And if the nail's angle has caused the flesh to retract inward, causing irritation and discomfort, you should place a thin wedge under the part of the nail that is irritating the flesh, lift it up, and carefully cut away the affected flesh.
Apply cauterizing and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh until it is completely removed, then treat the area with ointments until it heals. If the corruption has affected the bone, you should cut out and remove that bone, as healing will not occur while there is diseased bone present.
If you observe that the decay and corruption are spreading in the finger, then amputate it at one of the joints as previously described, and treat the area until it heals. If the nail is struck or bruised and severe pain occurs, you should first perform phlebotomy on the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp knife in a slanted incision from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh under the nail, for this will cause severe pain to the patient and may lead to excessive tissue growth at the site. Then treat the area with something that alleviates pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows on some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bones in part of it, and there may even be a nail. Part of its growth may occur at the base of one of the hand joints.
Or its growth may occur in some parts of the finger joints; those that grow at the joints do not move, while those that grow near the finger joint may move. The fleshy part is easier to remove and should be cut off at its base with a broad knife.
As for those that grow at the base of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so one should avoid cutting them. As for those that grow on a finger near one of the joints, it is necessary to first cut away the flesh in a circular manner to reach the bone, then use one of the appropriate saws to remove the bone.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the fusion that sometimes occurs between fingers, this often happens and can be something with which a person is born or may occur after a wound has healed or from burns and similar injuries. It is necessary to cut through such adhesions.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place a piece of felt or a moistened patch soaked in rose oil between them so that they do not reattach too quickly. Alternatively, insert a thin sheet of lead between them until the area properly heals.
And if the adhesion affects some fingers of the hand, then cut that adhesion as appropriate to improve and correct the appearance of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On Cutting Syndactylism.
Syndactylism are tortuous, thick veins filled with excess dark blood waste that occur in most parts of the body, but most commonly in the legs, especially in the shins, calves, and thighs. First, it is necessary to apply strong massages to remove the dark bile from the body repeatedly.
Then let blood from the patient using a basilic vein. As for treating it with iron, there are two methods: one is to incise and remove the black blood, and the other is to lacerate the vein and extract it entirely. For the incision, first warm the leg with hot water until it turns red.
Until the thick, murky blood becomes loose. Then bind the patient's leg tightly from above the thigh to just below the knee with a cloth. Then incise the vein in one place or two places or three, making a wide incision.
Then extract the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg to the top and from the top to the bottom until you remove what you consider sufficient or what the patient's strength can tolerate. Then bind it, and instruct the patient to avoid foods that generate black bile. Repeat the bleeding as necessary.
When the veins become full and this harms the patient, here is how to treat it: If there is a lot of hair on the leg, shave it off. Then take the patient to the bathhouse and warm their leg with hot water until it turns red and starts sweating, or have them engage in vigorous exercise.
If a bath is not available to warm the member, then make an incision along the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its base near the heel; then use scissors to cut open the skin and strip the vein from all sides until it can be felt.
When it appears, you will see it as a bright red vein; once it is freed from the skin, you will also see it resembling a tendon. Then insert your finger underneath it and lift it up until it rises above the skin, then suspend it with a smooth, blunt needle. Make another incision nearby, about three fingerbreadths away.
Then strip the skin away from the vein until it is visible, then lift it with your finger as you did before and suspend it with another smooth needle as you did initially. Then make another incision or several more if necessary.
Then pull it out and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it through the second incision until it emerges from there. Then pull it up to the previous incision and do this until you pull it completely out from the highest incision among all. Once it is fully out, cut it off.
If it does not respond to pulling, insert a strong thread through a needle and tie it securely. Then pull it and insert your finger under the vein and twist your hand in all directions until it emerges, being careful that it does not break; if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it.
It is detrimental to the patient to insert anything into the wound. Once you have completely extracted it, place wool soaked in syrup, rose oil, or olive oil on the site of the incisions and treat it until it heals. If the vein is spasmodic with wrinkles and twisted in various directions,
And if it is not straight as we said, you should cut along each twist and bend of its coils and then attach it to the hooks until you have straightened it all out; be careful when cutting that you do not sever or injure the vein, for otherwise it will be difficult for you to straighten it, so take care with your effort.
An image of the tool used to cut the hernia:
Image of the blind hook:
It should not have bends like other hooks, nor should it be sharp at the tip to avoid injuring the vein. It should be thick and smooth in its curvature, as if it were thin, it might cut the vein due to its fineness. Therefore, it should have a thickness advantage as we said.
Chapter Ninety-One.
On Straightening the Tortuous Vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands, and in dry, less fertile hot regions. It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its development is due to a corruption that occurs under the skin.
It also occurs inside living creatures as snakes, worms, and the swelling of a cucumber-like growth, as well as worms that develop between the skin and flesh. The sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is a severe inflammation in the leg, then the area becomes swollen, and then the vein begins to emerge from that swollen spot.
It appears like the root of a plant or animal. When its tip becomes visible, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two dirhams and secured, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever something comes out to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it is very long, cut some of it and wrap the rest; do not cut it from its root before it has all come out, for if you cut it, it will contract and go back into the flesh, causing a tumor, corruption at the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and pulled out little by little until it is completely removed and nothing remains in the body. In some people, what comes out from this vein may be as long as five fingers and ten.
I have heard that it once reached twenty fingers in length for a man. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a probe into its opening and fill it with a long plug along with the body until everything inside is emptied of its contents, and try to clean the area with medicines for several days.
Then treat it as you would treat tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, causing many openings from which branches emerge. Treat them as previously described in the division and treatment methods.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On Incising for the Worms Generated Under the Skin and Called Cattle Disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries "Cattle Disease" because it often affects cattle. It is a small worm that develops between the skin and flesh and spreads throughout the body, moving up and down.
Its presence is detected by the sensation of its movement from one part to another until it breaches and emerges at a place in the skin where it has penetrated. It forms as a result of corruption in some mixtures, just as worms, snakes, and pumpkin seeds may form in the belly due to such conditions.
And it is expected that her harm will be that if she enters the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, then perhaps she will open it and come out, thus ruining the eye, and this often happens. If you wish to treat her and remove her, then that should be done when she moves within the body and becomes apparent to the senses.
It is necessary to tightly bind what is above and below it with a ligature, then make an incision on top of it and remove it. If it sinks into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until it burns her away. The greatest danger from her is destroying the eye, as we have said.
If you see that it has become in the head near the eye, then tightly bind below it on the forehead with a ligature, then make an incision and remove it. It is necessary for the patient to cleanse his body with medicines that ease the putrid and bad humors and to be cautious about foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On Incising the Disease Known as Nafir.
This disease, which is called nafir in our country, is a pain that appears in one of the organs and then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as I will describe to you.
I was called to see a sick woman in one of the villages. When I examined her arm, I noticed a slight swelling in one of the veins. After waiting for a short while, I saw this swelling move along with the tendon, like a worm moving upwards towards her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
If it flows from one place to another, the pain subsides in that place and remains in the shoulder. Then after sitting for a while, it runs through the entire body until it reaches the other arm, then she told me that her whole body is moving as she observed.
I was amazed at the speed with which it moved from one member to another. I had not seen this disease in such a way before, although I had heard of cases where the pain moves from one member to another, but I had never witnessed it as I did in this woman.
I did not expect this except that the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and visible veins, hence this moving air appeared to the senses in such a way. It should not appear in this manner on those who live in luxury, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels the pain, then if it appears as mentioned above, bind it tightly from above and below with haste and make an incision so that this congested air can escape, and dress the area.
If you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it by fumigation of the body and with remedies that expel air and disperse it, such as rotten seeds, scammony, and similar medicines.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On the Removal of Arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and according to the places where they lodge in the body. As for their difference according to types, there are large and small ones; some are hollow glass arrows and others are solid glass arrows; and there are those with three corners and four corners.
And some of them have tongues, and some have fragments. As for those that occur according to the organs in which they are located, they are of two kinds: either the organs are principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. When an arrow strikes one of these organs and the signs of death that I will describe to you become apparent, it is advisable to avoid removing that arrow, for in most cases death will be the consequence. And when these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deeply into the organ, remove it and treat the wound. Among the signs of brain injury when an arrow penetrates and pierces the bone, causing a tear in the membrane covering the brain, is severe headache, vomiting, and dizziness.
And when these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deeply into the organ, remove it and treat the wound. Among the signs of brain injury when an arrow penetrates and pierces the bone, causing a tear in the membrane covering the brain, is severe headache, vomiting, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion, vomiting, and it may happen that blood comes out of the nostrils or ears. Speech may be interrupted, the voice may disappear, and a white moist substance like paste may come out from the wound, with a liquid similar to meat broth flowing from it.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not already been removed. As for the signs of an arrow when it strikes the heart and is close to the left breast and feels as though it has embedded in a solid object rather than an empty space.
It may also be that the arrow has a movement similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting. Know for certain that death is inevitable. The sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck become swollen, the patient's color changes, and he breathes heavily; he seeks to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the membrane in the chest, it is close to the small ribs, and breathing becomes very difficult with severe pain.
He sighs and moves all the muscles of his shoulders. If the arrow strikes the liver, it is followed by severe pain, and blood similar in redness to that from the liver exits the wound. If the arrow hits the stomach, something undigested may come out of the wound.
The situation is clear. If the arrow penetrates the abdomen and something comes out of the wound, whether it be feces or if an intestine has been pierced, there is no hope for treatment or removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine exits.
And if something protrudes from the wound and the pain becomes severe for the patient, know that he is doomed. As for other parts such as the face, eyes, throat, shoulder, upper arm, spine, elbow, thigh, leg, and similar limbs, they generally fare better in most situations.
If the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve and is not poisoned, I will inform you about what I have witnessed concerning such arrows so that you may use it to guide your treatment. An arrow once struck a man in the bridge of his nose at its base.
I removed it for him from the other side, underneath the cartilage of his ear, and he recovered without any harm to his eye. I also removed an arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the iris of his eye below the lower eyelid; the arrowhead was concealed, and all that could be seen was its small tip attached to the shaft.
There was a large arrow from the composite quiver, with a square iron tip that was smooth and had no ears. The Jew recovered and his eye suffered no ill effects. Another arrow was removed from the throat of a Christian, and this arrow was Arabian.
It was an arrow with two ears. I split it for him between the throat muscles, as it had lodged in his throat. I handled it carefully until I removed it, and the Christian recovered and healed. I also removed another arrow from a man who had been struck by it in his abdomen; we estimated that he would die from it.
After thirty days or so had passed and there was no change in his condition, I split the arrow and devised a way to remove it; he recovered without any adverse effects. I also saw a man who was struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound adhered to the arrow.
After seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh. I also saw a woman who was struck by an arrow in her abdomen; the wound adhered to the arrow and it remained inside without any change in her condition. She did not feel any harm from it in terms of her natural functions.
I also saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face; the wound adhered to the arrow and he did not feel much pain from it. There are many similar cases. I removed an arrow from a commander of the Sultan's forces who had been struck by it near the center of his nose, which had slightly shifted to the right side.
The arrow had completely penetrated. I was called to treat him three days after the incident. I found the wound from the arrow very narrow. I probed it with a thin probe but could not feel the arrow. He felt a pricking and pain under his right ear due to the wound.
I hoped that the wound was from the tip of the arrow, so I bandaged the area with a dressing that had pulling power and warmth, hoping that it would swell and reveal the mark of the arrow. When I cut it open, nothing happened to indicate that the arrow had reached the spot.
I continued to bandage it for many days, but nothing happened. So, I sealed the wound during that time, and the patient was despairing of its removal for a period until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me of this. I placed a sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I probed it; I felt the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the wood. Then, I increased the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to us. It took me about four months for this to happen.
After the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not respond to coming out. So, I kept trying gently and devising various tools until one day I grabbed it with tight forceps, the design of which will be shown at the end of this chapter.
The doctors had ruled that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it anyway. The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely without any further issues at all. I am telling you about how to remove some arrows so that you can use this as a basis and guide for what has not been mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be understood by description alone, nor can a book encompass them all. The skilled craftsman measures the little against the much, and what is present against what is absent, and derives new work and new machinery when faced with strange occurrences.
If you ask about this craft, I say that arrows come out of the organs in which they are embedded in two ways: either by being drawn out from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side, and those that come out from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy part, and it can be pulled out and removed. If it does not respond to being extracted at the time of its entry, you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it decomposes, making it easier to pull out and remove. The same applies if it lodges in bone.
If it does not respond to being extracted, leave it for several days and attempt to pull and move it every day, as it will eventually come out. If it still does not come out after several days, you should drill around the arrow in the same bone from all sides with a fine awl until there is enough space for the arrow, then pull it out and remove it.
If the embedded arrow is in the bone of the head and has penetrated one of the compartments of the brain, and some of those symptoms you have been informed about appear on the patient, then refrain from pulling out the arrow and leave it until his condition improves after several days.
Deal with drawing out the arrow and removing it. If it is deeply embedded and does not respond to being drawn, then use drills around the arrow as I have described for you, then treat the wound until it heals. As for if the arrow has concealed itself in a part of the body. And if it escapes the senses, probe for it with a探针。如果感觉到它，就用一些适合拔出它的工具将其拉出来。如果没有能力因为伤口狭窄和箭矢深入而无法触及，而且附近没有骨骼、神经或血管。
Make an incision on it until the wound widens and you can reach the arrow to remove it. If it has two barbs, free the flesh entangled in them from all sides by any means possible; if you cannot free the flesh, break off the barbs and untangle them until they are removed.
And when you attempt to remove the arrow from any part, use your fingers with forceps in all directions until it is free. Be as gentle as possible so that the arrow does not break, making it difficult for you to draw and extract it. If you cannot manage it within your available time.
Leave it for several days until the flesh around it begins to decay, then return to it, as it will be easier at that time. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in its section. Be cautious not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon, and employ ingenuity.
Use any means you can to free the arrow, doing so with gentleness, patience, and composure as I have described for you. It is best that when you are drawing out the arrow, you position the patient as they were when the arrow struck them, which is more appropriate.
If you cannot do that, use what is available to you in terms of shapes. As for the arrow that comes out from the opposite side, either some part of it protrudes outside, or you will feel its tip by touch near the top of the skin and see it protruding.
Make an incision for it, and let the incision be large enough to accommodate forceps. Then pull it out, as it will come easily. If it gets stuck in a bone, twist your hand around its curvature until the arrow affects the bone and widens its own path, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days and then try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in place, push it out with something appropriate. If the shaft has fallen off and you wish to push it, insert a hollow instrument into it so that its hollow part fits over the arrowhead, then push it out with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits into its hollow part; this will make it easier for the arrow to come out. If the arrow is poisoned, you should excise all the flesh that has been affected by the poison if possible, then treat it as needed.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side and is close to an area that can be probed with a probe, and if you can make an incision, do so while being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, then remove it.
Then outline the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals. Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:
Its ends are like the beak of a bird, made so that when they grasp an arrow or something else, they do not let go. Various sizes are made from them: large, small, and medium-sized, all according to the size of the arrow, its thickness, and the width or narrowness of the wound.
Image of the hollow cannon:
Image of the solid musket:
This is solid at the end like a rod to make it easy for it to enter the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
On Cutting Veins.
There are thirty veins in the body that are usually cut, sixteen of which are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the hesis, and the two veins visible in the temples, and the two veins at the corners of the eyes known as the nazir.
The upright vein in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two veins on the sides of the neck known as udajan, the two veins in the upper lip, and the two veins in the lower lip, which are known as jaharak, and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins that are cut in the arm and hand, there are five veins: one is called quifal, which is on the inner side, and it is known to the general public as the head vein. The other is al-akhal, which is the middle vein composed of a branch of basilic and a branch of quifal, and it is known to the general public as the body vein.
And Basilic, which is located on the inner side and is also called axillary, and it is commonly known as the abdominal vein or arm cord, and this is the one that adheres to it and is prominently visible above the thumb, and Assilm.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, which has two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one under the popliteal from the medial side, the second is the sesamoid on the inner side near the heel, and the sciatic vein on the medial side at the Achilles tendon.
In the other leg, there are also three veins like them. As for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is in lancing them for chronic catarrhs, migraines, shingles, and chronic, poorly healing head sores. The method of lancing them will be described as follows.
It involves shaving the patient's head and vigorously rubbing the area behind where the veins are located with a coarse cloth. Then, the patient’s neck is constricted with a turban until the veins become visible behind the ears in the lower parts of the head. You should feel for their pulse under your finger; once you locate it, mark that spot with ink.
Then take a lancet-like scalpel, known as a nashl. Insert it under the vein through the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein along with the skin in one clean cut. The length of the incision should be about the width of two clenched fingers.
Or something similar, and let out as much blood as desired, then bandage them until they heal. It was mentioned earlier in the beginning of the book how to cut and cauterize them. As for the two arteries in the temples, their benefit is in lancing them for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent conjunctivitis, and acute purulent discharges directed towards the eyes.
How to dissect them as I describe to you: The patient should pull his neck with a turban until the veins become clearly visible, and you can feel their pulse under your fingers. At that moment, mark them with ink, then lift the skin above the vein from its base upward with your index finger.
Insert the scalpel from below and lift the vein upwards, then cut it as you did with the other two veins. Let out as much blood as needed, then loosen the patient's neck restraint and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then place a cotton pad and bandage on it, securing it tightly from above. Leave it until he recovers. The treatment of these veins has been mentioned earlier in the beginning of the book, along with their cutting and bleeding procedures. As for the venesection of the frontal vein, its benefit comes after that of the temporal vein for chronic ailments of the face such as psoriasis, ulcers, and persistent redness.
How to perform it as I describe to you: The patient should pull his neck with a turban until the vein becomes visible, then take the instrument called the faas, and this is its appearance:.
Place the prong at the head of the faas on the same vein and strike it from above with a comb or something similar. Let the blood flow to the desired amount, then loosen the patient's neck restraint and secure it until he recovers.
It may also be opened with a wide scalpel, except that the scalpel should not have a sharp tip like other scalpels; instead, it should have a slightly wider tip. Perform the venesection at an angle because the bone is close, and the scalpel might break if it were thin.
As for the two veins that are in the hollow of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, ulcers, and facial diseases. As for how to puncture them, it is that the patient should tie his neck with a turban, then you puncture them while standing at his head, and let the puncturing be slightly angled towards the length with a small but somewhat wide lancet.
If the area has no flesh, then if the lancet is thin at the tip, it may break. Then let blood as needed and place a piece of cotton on them and wrap them for one night before removing it. As for puncturing the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fever.
Severe headache and diseases of the face such as red spots that appear in the nose, especially if they are chronic. The method of puncturing is that the patient ties his neck and you hold his nose with your left hand, then take a thin long lancet.
And insert it in the middle of the nasal septum itself, between the partitions of the nose, straight ahead because the vein does not appear to the touch there; blood will immediately emerge. You should apply a little pressure with your hand on the lancet and let out as much blood as needed, then wrap it for one night because it quickly heals.
As for the jugular veins, their benefit from puncturing them is for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and pigmented diseases that appear on the surface of the skin such as black vitiligo, carbuncles, bad ulcers, and other similar conditions. The method of puncturing them is to tie the patient under them at his neck with a strap, and the practitioner should stand at the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then let the blood flow from the vein widely but slightly, then take an appropriate amount of blood or as needed, then do the same for the other vein, then loosen the tourniquet.
Tie the veins with moderate tightness so that the patient does not suffocate, and leave it until tomorrow as the wound will heal. As for the veins of the cheeks, their benefit is in letting them bleed after bleeding the temporal vein because it helps against ulcers in the mouth, decay of the gums, foul ulcers, splitting of the lips, and foul sores.
Those that are in the nose and around it, and how to bleed them: Have the patient sit before you and tie his neck with a turban, then turn his lips and look at the two veins which you see one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and identify them by their darkness.
This is also because around them are thin black veins, so cut them cleanly. If you are unsure and do not know which ones they are, aim to cut the larger and more prominent ones. Do the same for the two veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, their benefit is in letting them bleed after bleeding the temporal vein for treating abscesses that occur in the throat due to hiccups and diseases of the mouth. To bleed them, have the patient sit before you facing the sun, raise his tongue, and look underneath it on one side for a vein and on the other side for another vein, both having a dark color.
Bleed them but be careful not to cut them deeply as there are arteries beneath them, and bleeding from those arteries might cause excessive blood loss. As for the three veins that are bled in the elbow, it is customary to bleed these veins in people generally, and their bleeding can be done in two ways.
Either sewing with a broad rose scissors or olive scissors to the thickness, or cutting with a knife-like scissors, which is called nashl. [And this is its image], the image of the broad rose scissors:.
It is broad as you see, suitable for opening hollow veins that are full, prominent, visible, tough, and contain thick, dark blood. This is the image of the olive scissors:.
This scissors is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for bleeding fine veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the nashl scissors:.
This nashl, which is suitable for cutting, comes in broad and fine types depending on the width and narrowness of the veins as well. It can also be used for other purposes, and it is well-known among practitioners.
As for the basiliq, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from ailments located under the throat and neck, near the chest and abdomen. The person performing the bleed should be cautious and wary, as there is an artery below this vein; if they make a mistake and go too deep with the scissors, they may cut this artery.
This can cause excessive bleeding, so it should not be bled with a needle but rather by cutting with nashl. If the basiliq does not appear clearly, it is advisable to avoid it and instead go for another vein or seek one of its branches.
Or you can bleed the arm artery, which is clear, by cutting it with the nashl scissors as we have said. If you wish to bleed it specifically, before tightening the arm, you should palpate the area until you identify the pulse location and then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and cut the vein obliquely with the sharp knife as we said, and be careful that the incision is made away from the location of the artery. And when you see inflation in the place you marked with ink while tightening the ligature, then this inflation is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood during venesection jumping as urine does from a child, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is arterial blood. At this moment, quickly place your finger on it for a long while, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often will stop; then tie the arm.
Leave it and warn the patient not to neglect it; let it be on his neck, and do not move it for days until he recovers. If the bleeding does not stop and overwhelms you, and no remedy is available at hand, then cut the artery if it appears to you, as its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take the shell of a pistachio, split it, and take one half and tightly tie it with ligatures and bandages to the site of the vein for another day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise treat it as previously mentioned by applying pressure points to stop bleeding. Cutting the artery is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the small size of the incision and the effectiveness of the ligature on the arm, be aware of this. As for the black vein, the benefit of venesection is that it draws blood from the top of the head to the lower part of the body, as it is composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, as we said.
It is advisable for the surgeon to operate on the neck of the person being treated, for below it lies a nerve. If he increases the number of stitches from his incision and injures the nerve, numbness will occur which is difficult to detect, and often does not heal at all. This nerve is often perceptible by touch.
If it is hidden in some people and thin, so that it cannot be seen, then you should make your incision with a scalpel and do your best to avoid the nerve. If the vein lies between two nerves, cut the vein longitudinally. As for the qifal vein, the benefit of ligating it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this particular vein, if you wish to ligate it; you should do so with stitches using the olive-shaped scalpel or the wide rose-shaped scalpel because it is safer than all other veins since there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, when ligating, you should avoid cutting only the muscle's head with the scalpel and seek a softer spot. It does no harm if it is not hit on the first attempt, but it may swell in some people if it is not ligated on the first attempt.
However, this swelling does him no harm. As for the method of venesection and its consequences, and what should be done in its correction: first, you should know that venesection is used solely to preserve health.
Or it is used for treating diseases. The venesection that is used to preserve and maintain health and to prevent the occurrence of diseases should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the qifal, aqikhal, and basiliq. It should also be done at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed since dawn, whereas phlebotomy used for treating diseases has no fixed time and can be done at any hour of the day or night as needed.
At every hour and at any time, it should not be done for boys until they reach fourteen years of age, nor for old men who have surpassed sixty years. If anyone decides to undergo phlebotomy for any reason.
It is necessary to cleanse his intestines with a mild enema before phlebotomy if there is much accumulated feces, so that during the procedure, putrefied waste does not draw into the veins and harm the principal organs. Phlebotomy should not be performed on someone who is nauseous, intoxicated, or drunk until these conditions subside.
He should also be cautious about phlebotomy immediately after vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, or any other matter that weakens the body physically or mentally. Then, before proceeding, check if the blood is thick by observing its consistency and take necessary measures to thin it if needed.
He should use food, drinks, and medicines if possible to achieve this. Then, he may enter the bathhouse if there is no prohibition or engage in some exercise to thin the blood, making his phlebotomy at the beginning of the day as we have said, and he should aim to keep his mind free from all negative mental distractions on that day.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical burdens like excessive fatigue, overexertion, intercourse, and the like. Prepare for his presence items that people usually use by habit, such as various perfumes, flowers, amusements, and the like, each person according to what is possible for them.
Then the operator sits on a cushion that is higher than the one on which the patient sits, then he extends his arm and the operator strokes it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with pincers and twists it two or three times, and let the tightening be moderate.
Because excessive tightening prevents the flow of blood, and if it is too loose it also prevents the flow of blood. After tightening, it is necessary for the operator to rub both hands of the patient together by pressing them against each other.
Until the veins become swollen and visible, then the operator wipes the scalpel with a little old oil, then he places his index finger of the left hand on the same vein slightly below the intended cutting point to avoid missing the vein and to guide the cut. Because there are veins that you find like a tendon, which retract when attempting to cut them, and there are others that are full of air; whenever the scalpel is placed on them, they collapse under the scalpel and deceive the operator, not allowing the scalpel to open the vein properly. Even if it does open the vein, it opens it narrowly.
Therefore, it is necessary for the operator to be cautious and deliberate in all these matters, then he should lower the scalpel; if the vein opens with that stroke, well and good, but if not, he should repeat it once again slightly below or above that spot without delay, provided the area does not become swollen.
If the area becomes swollen or if the patient is distressed, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, as it may cause inflammation. Do not enter the bathhouse either. Then repeat the procedure if desired, especially if the scalpel penetrated but the opening was small and the blood flow was thin.
I fear that the amount of blood you want will not come out, so prepare the scalpel in the same hole and make it straight, and increase the opening a little. Do this quickly before the area becomes swollen, for in many people the area may swell with even a small incision.
If you see that it has swollen, do not return to it at all, for it will not help you. Place something of thick oil on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this place than the oil itself or any other fats. And so.
Use thick oil in all your bloodletting from veins when the flow of blood is difficult. The elixir called Ferouk and Shakhzania can also be used if applied to the area, for they make thick blood thin and liquid.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of bleeding, it often happens, especially for those who have been bled only that once or whose vein incision was small. Act quickly and place on the swelling a sponge soaked in warm salt water, lightly applied for an hour; it will dissipate.
You should do this after the blood has completely come out of the vein itself or from another vein. If a few days later there is still some blackness or greenness in the area, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something of dissolved rue and honey.
Or something from the juice of fumitory or similar. Often a swelling and bad pimple occurs when bleeding basilic veins; place your hand on it, if you find that it oozes when you press it, then this is a bad pimple, so be careful not to put anything on it from what has been mentioned.
For it may well exude blood from an artery, but dress it with something that causes constriction to harden the area; then treat him with all other treatments until he recovers. And it is best to let out of each person's blood according to their strength and what appears of the prevailing color in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness subsides. And for one who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have bloodletting done all at once.
Enlarge the sweat vein and let the lancet be wide; but for one who is weak, do the opposite. It should be drawn out in stages, and the puncture should be narrow. The best to use for venesection is a blade that is angled and curved, making a cut rather than stitches.
This type of venesection is free from bleeding and cutting a nerve, and it is better and safer than venesection by length or breadth. For one who often faints during venesection, it is advisable to feed him before the procedure with bread soaked in pomegranate water or scallion water.
If he is heated and you let out his blood in three or four sessions, if his temperament is cold, then he should take bread soaked in syrup of barberry or in sweetened honey scented with flowers or in fragrant herbal syrup before the venesection.
If fainting occurs during venesection and the cause is the excessive loss of blood, it is advisable to give him meat water and light fragrant syrup, use perfumed oils for anointing, massage his chest with it, and employ all that we have mentioned in the treatment of fainting.
Regarding vomiting, and as for one who wishes to let blood from his arm again, it is necessary for him whose aim is to vomit much but whose strength is weak that the blood be released little by little according to his strength over consecutive days.
And as for one who wishes to let blood from his arm again and whose body is strong, he should do so seven or nine hours after his first session. And as for one who wishes to draw blood from his body toward the opposite direction to which it has inclined, it is necessary to let blood for him on the second or third day.
And as for one who has much blood in his body that has become hot and intense, causing fever, it is necessary to remove the blood in one go and extract a large quantity, widening the incision until fainting occurs, after ensuring all conditions of venesection are properly attended to. And place your hand on his pulse as the blood flows to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often happens if the person performing venesection is ignorant and careless. It is not advisable to release the arm and let blood again if this occurs.
And if the sweat gland has closed and the blood is difficult to release, do not pinch it hard or twist it forcefully, as this is very bad. Instead, either leave it until you perform venesection again, or remove with a scalpel any coagulated blood in the sweat gland opening.
Or apply a bit of dissolved salt or a portion of the ferocious antidote or schyzania to it and pinch it gently until the blood comes out. If the vein has swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity calls for bleeding again, either let blood above that site or let blood in the other arm or from another vein.
As for letting blood from the arm vein, it should be done instead of using achocha and parsley if they are not available or are scarce, since this vein is composed of them. The method of letting blood is that the patient should put his hand in hot water until the tendons become red and the vein becomes clearly visible, then tie a tourniquet above it with moderate tightness.
Then let the blood from the vein at a slight angle, neither too wide nor too long, and make the incision relatively wide. Let the bleeding be above the wrist joint slightly. If the blood does not flow easily, then put the hand back in the hot water container and allow the blood to run into the water.
Until your need is met. If you are in the summer days, you may not need to put the hand back in hot water. Most often, letting blood flow in hot water occurs during winter. Letting blood from this vein is safer than from all other veins. Because there is no harmful vein or nerve under it. As for letting blood from the asilim vein in the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of letting blood is to tie the wrist with a tourniquet or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no harmful vein or nerve under it. As for letting blood from the asilim vein in the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of letting blood is to tie the wrist with a tourniquet or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells. It becomes very clear to the senses then let the blood from it at a slight angle, and even if you cut it completely, it will not harm it. Be cautious; do not press deeply with the lancet as there is a nerve under it, and the area is exposed without much flesh. Then put the hand back in hot water.
Let it flow in it, for if you do not refresh it with hot water, the blood will freeze in the mouth of the vein and stop flowing. When you have taken out as much blood as is needed, put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal too quickly.
And you should do the same with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of stopping it with the left hand, it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen, and you should do this as you did with the second one, equally. As for bleeding the safn, its benefit is for ailments in the lower body, such as diseases of the uterus.
And for the retention of menstruation, diseases of the kidneys, chronic sores on the thighs and legs, and similar ailments, the method of bleeding is as follows: He should put his foot in hot water and have it massaged until the veins swell. Then, above the knee joint, bind it tightly with a bandage, and the vein to be bled is located at the instep towards the thumb.
It branches out into many small branches on the leg. Bleed in the widest branch of it or at the instep where they come together, for this is better and safer. If you bleed on the surface of the leg, be careful not to injure the nerves beneath the skin.
Make your incision obliquely as if you were going to amputate it, and use a scalpel. If the blood does not come out, refresh his leg with hot water and let the blood flow freely until it stops. If the bleeder misses the vein on the first attempt.
Let him try bleeding a little above, for this place is safe and poses no danger if you are careful of the nerve as we said. Do the same with the safn on the other leg equally. As for the sciatic vein, its location is as we said at the heel from the inner side.
And the benefit of its removal for hip pain if it is due to hot blood and how to remove it: The patient should enter the bath and hurry, and bind his leg from the hip to four fingers above the heel with a thin long turban; otherwise, it will not appear.
When it appears, remove it according to your expertise, either by incision, which is better, or by amputation or by cutting it open if the place is safe. It is in most people extremely subtle, so if you do not find it.
And if it does not appear at all to the senses, then remove some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little toe and the ring finger, and be careful of the nerves, and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then release the binding and place a cotton pad on the site of the incision, and bind it; it will quickly heal.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
On Cupping and How to Use It.
Cupping instruments may be made of horns, wood, brass, or glass. Cupping is performed in two ways: one by making incisions and drawing blood, and the other without making incisions.
This cupping without making incisions is performed in two ways.
And the acupuncture points of the two temples, which are the two sides of the neck from both sides, and the point under the chin below the lower jaw from the mouth, and the acupuncture points of the shoulders, and the points at the coccyx on the buttocks, and the points in the middle of the thighs, and the points of the shins, and the points of the popliteal fossae.
Cupping therapy draws blood from the thin veins scattered in the flesh, and it does not weaken the body as much as bloodletting does. It should not be used, whether with heat or without, in any disease caused by excess until the entire body has been purged.
If there is a need for cupping due to a disease or as a preventive measure, it can be used at any time, whether at the beginning of the month, at its end, in the middle, or at any other time.
This is because there are people who, when their blood becomes excessive and they need to have it removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headaches in their head. Some of them experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. Others may feel itching on their face and cheekbones, as well as dark spots and irritation in their eyes. There are also those who itch at the site of the acupuncture points.
Some people may become more talkative or laugh frequently. Others may taste blood in their mouth, have swollen gums, and spit blood. Some may sleep excessively, while others see visions of blood, redness, dead bodies, wounds, and similar images in their dreams. Whenever we observe any of these signs.
In particular, if there is something in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours have passed since daybreak. As for the benefit of spot cupping, it helps with heaviness in the head and fluid that drips into the eyes.
However, it should be done after purging the body. This cupping can serve as an alternative to bloodletting from the veins. It is important to avoid using it on those with cold brains or who have a cold, for it would greatly harm them.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly or those with cold diseases in their heads, and those who are addicted to it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, it is necessary to order the cupper to lower his hand slightly downward with the lancet, fearing the development of forgetfulness. As for cupping the shoulder, it serves as an alternative to bloodletting from the occipital vein and the basilic vein.
It is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, swelling of the respiratory organs, coughing, and fullness. It is necessary to raise cupping on the shoulder slightly because if it is directed downward, it would cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is beneficial for sudden pains in the head, eye infections, migraines, choking, and pain at the roots of the teeth. It serves as an alternative to bloodletting from the basilic vein. You should instruct the cupper not to dig deep with the lancet so as not to cut an artery, which could cause excessive bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for abscesses in the mouth, gum disease, and other diseases of the mouth. It can serve as an alternative to bloodletting from the veins on the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
As for cupping the inner sides of the thighs, it is beneficial for what bloodletting from the three veins (basilic, occipital, and median cubital) would treat. This is because it draws blood from all those thin veins in the flesh and attracts these thin veins from thicker ones until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
You should order the leechkeeper not to be excessive in applying the cupping glass, because the area is thin and has nerves and arteries beneath it. As for a single cupping session applied to the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the rectum and ulcers of the lower region.
You should order the leechkeeper to use a large cupping glass, and it should be made of brass because the area requires strong suction, and a glass one might break due to excessive force. As for the cupping glasses used on the legs, they noticeably reduce swelling.
Because they draw blood from the entire body and are beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; they promote menstruation and are helpful for boils and varicose veins. They serve as an alternative to bleeding the ankles and knees, although they greatly weaken the body and cause fainting in most people. The benefit of cupping the popliteal areas is similar to that of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is as follows: place the cupping glass empty first and apply moderate suction. Do not keep the cups in one place for too long but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors flow evenly to the area. Continue repeating this process until you see the area has turned red and opened up.
When the redness of the blood appears, then apply moderate suction gradually. Then observe the condition of the body; for those who have thin flesh with open pores, you should cup them only once to avoid ulceration at the site.
You should order the leechkeeper to widen the incision slightly and deepen it, adjusting the suction gently with careful movement. If the blood is thick, you should have them perform the procedure twice: in the first time, open a path for the thin and watery part of the blood, and in the second time, to thoroughly extract the thicker blood.
If the blood is very thick, the procedure should be repeated a third time to reach the goal. In general, if we want to extract a small amount of blood, one pass will suffice; if we wish to extract more blood, we repeat the process more times. If the blood is thick, we assume it will require more effort.
We should perform a deep bloodletting, and the moderate depth of puncture is only as deep as the skin. What should be used among ointments when applying leeches and water, and what the person undergoing bloodletting should beware of. As for those whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and with narrow pores.
The areas where the leeches will be applied should be ointmented with substances that are clarifying, softening, and dissolving. In summer, ointments such as Khiri oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or cucumber seed oil may be used.
In winter, ointments such as narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or hyacinth oil may be used. If the phlegm is thick and cold, then use oils like murtajush oil, mandrake oil, frankincense oil, or spikenard oil and similar ones.
If the person undergoing bloodletting has wide pores and soft flesh, ointment should be avoided. These individuals should wash their leech bites after bleeding with rose water or cold water or wild grape water or pumpkin water or daisy water and similar ones. As for those whose blood is very moist,
They should wash their leech bites with vinegar or water from wormwood and sumac and similar ones. As for those whose phlegm is thick, they should wash their leech bites with old wine or murtajush water or spikenard decoction or chamomile decoction and similar ones. It is important to avoid bloodletting in a bathhouse or immediately after bathing.
It is advisable to perform cupping one hour or two hours after coming out of the bath, and it is not advisable for anyone to sleep after cupping. What should be done by the person undergoing cupping and the practitioner before and after cupping.
First, you should consider if the person undergoing cupping or bloodletting has jaundice and if his blood is sharp and inflamed; then he should take cooling agents such as pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, scallions, radish, and similar. His diet should include thin gruel, mutton stews, and similar foods.
And if his constitution is cold, he should be given honey syrup, mubyah syrup or bazaar scallion syrup, and moderate aromatic wine that lies between old and new. He should be instructed to eat less, and his diet should include thin gruel, millet porridge, birds, and young pigeons stewed with eggs. It is advisable for the person to drink more on the day of cupping or bloodletting than he eats.
It may be advisable to give some people the Tariq al-Farouq elixir or musk medicine or siltha before cupping or bloodletting, or after it, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood. It should not be given by inexperienced practitioners.
As for unrestricted cupping, it is the type of cupping placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, and the area of the kidneys and upper thigh. These organs cannot tolerate restricted cupping, and what is intended with them is to draw blood from one part to another.
As we place the cupping vessel on the breasts in the case of epistaxis or to induce a cold vapor from the part if it has become congested, so do we place it on the abdomen and navel; for it loosens the part and warms it, removing pain by releasing that vapor.
It may be placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stone, for its strength of suction may open the obstruction or dislodge the stone from its place. It also does this when applied to the liver and spleen in case of vapor that has become disturbed in them. These cupping vessels may be used empty by suction only.
It may be used with fire, and it may also be used filled with warm water for ailments of the sciatica. This is done by filling the cupping vessel, which should be large, with hot water alone or with water in which some herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Then it is placed, filled, on the affected area and held in place, removed, and reapplied as needed. This is an image of the cupping vessel that is used with fire:.
Its mouth should be two fingers wide as depicted, and its depth should be half a finger. There should be a small hole on one side, about halfway up, the size of which an acupuncture needle can fit. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow brass with a thick rim.
It should be smooth, level, and polished so as not to injure the part when it is applied. In the middle of it, there should be a protruding piece of copper or iron where the candle with fire is placed. These cupping vessels can also be made larger than described or smaller depending on the diseases.
And prepare it as needed, for the scarificator of children and thin people is different from that of men with robust bodies. As for how to place this scarificator on fire onto the part, light a wick made of flax or a small candle made of bitumen with fire, and place it in the middle of the erect rod which is at the center of the scarificator.
Let the fire rise upwards towards the bottom of the scarificator so that the patient's body does not get burned. Then place it on the part, and keep a finger on the hole we mentioned until when we hold the scarificator as needed, we remove the finger.
Steam will then come out of that hole, and the scarificator will release at its position. Then light the wick as described and repeat if necessary. As for the scarificator used to treat hydrocele with water, it does not have an erect rod or a hole.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it on the part only. This is its image:.
The larger this scarificator is, the more water it can hold, and thus it is better.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
On the Application of Leeches.
Leeches are used in most cases on parts where scarificators cannot be applied, either due to their small size such as the lip and gum, or because the part is devoid of flesh like a finger or nose.
The method of using them is to select leeches from fresh, clean water, free from contaminants. Then leave them in freshwater for a day and night until they are hungry and empty inside. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, and then the affected part is cleansed.
Until it turns red, then place it on the area; when it is full, it will fall off. If possible, sucking the area with a lancing instrument is more effective; otherwise, wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water, rub it, and press it. If this continues, blood will flow after the leech falls off, which is considered beneficial bleeding. Then wet a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it above until the bleeding stops. If there is excessive blood, sprinkle finely powdered saffron, oak bark, or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or apply slices of peeled colocasia to the area.
Leave it until the colocasia slices adhere to the area, as this will stop the bleeding. If leeches need to be reapplied, do not use the same leech if possible; instead, apply fresh blood to the area to attract new leeches.
Or insert a needle into the area to release some blood, then place the leech; once it senses blood, it will adhere. If you want to remove it, sprinkle some geranium, salt, or ashes on it; it will detach from the site.
The Third Chapter.
On Bone Setting and Fracture Treatment.
This chapter is also part of the craft required in the practice of medicine, dealing with setting fractures and resetting dislocated bones.
Know, my children, that this chapter is claimed by ignorant physicians, common people, and those who have never examined any book of the ancients or read a single word about it.
For this reason, this art has become non-existent in our country, and I have never found anyone who excels in it at all. And I only gained what I have through the long hours of reading the books of the ancients and my dedication to understanding them until I extracted that knowledge from them, then I devoted myself to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have illustrated for you in this chapter all that is within my knowledge on the subject. My experience has been applied to it after presenting it to you, purging it of unnecessary length, abbreviating it as much as possible, clarifying it to the utmost extent, and depicting many illustrations of the instruments used in it.
For it is an addition to the explanation as I did in the preceding chapters, and there is no power but with God, the Exalted, the Almighty.
The First Section.
It is best to present summaries and general points regarding the treatment of broken bones before we begin to describe each fractured or dislocated member one by one. It is necessary to mention in the beginning of this chapter some statements and sections. It first compels you to understand it and grasp its truth, both for yourself and for those who are eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that when anyone sustains a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, it is necessary first to proceed with reduction or purging, or both. Unless there is a hindrance such as weakness of strength or the one affected by it is a child or an extremely old person, or the time is excessively hot or cold.
Then he should limit his diet to cold legumes, poultry meat, and broth; avoid drinks, tough meats, overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood until the swelling is safe and there is no risk of fluid accumulation in the area.
At that time, the patient should return to his usual regimen. When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be fed nutritious foods that are thick and hearty, such as tripe, rice, heads, feet, and calves of cattle, which have viscosity. Eggs, soft fish, thick drinks, and similar foods should also be part of this regimen, as it will make the healing of the fracture faster and better. Note that if bones are broken in strong men or elderly people, they cannot naturally reunite and heal as they once were.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, it is not possible for them to naturally reconnect and heal. However, extremely soft bones, such as those of very young children, may unite and adhere. The body generates new tissue around the broken bone that resembles glue, which thickens and adheres to the bone, binding it together from all sides.
It binds together until it becomes as strong and secure as it was originally, so that nothing impedes its function.
For this reason, it is necessary to provide the patient with foods that have strength, viscosity, and thickness as we have said. And know that fractures differ in types according to the difference in body parts because a fracture of the shinbone differs from a skull fracture, and a rib fracture differs from a spinal fracture.
Similarly, all other body parts differ from one another, and we will come to describe each type of fracture explained in its chapter detailedly separately. Also, the type of bone fracture may itself differ.
Because it may be a transverse fracture without any fragments being produced, or it may be a longitudinal fracture with fragments that are either clean or not clean and protruding. The fracture may also occur with a wound or tear in the skin, or it may be a slight crack.
And each type has a specific method for its reduction, as will be mentioned in detail where appropriate. What identifies a bone fracture is its misalignment, irregularity, appearance to the senses, and brittleness when you touch it with your hand.
When there is no obvious misalignment or brittleness, and you do not feel any disturbance when palpating the bone, and the patient does not experience much pain, then there is no fracture. It may be a sprain or a slight crack, so it should not be moved by pulling or pressing at all.
Rather, apply the medicines that will be mentioned later which are appropriate for the condition, then bind it gently. Know that if the bone has split into two without producing any fragments, each part may have moved away from its partner.
You should proceed to correct and even out the condition before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, wait until it subsides, then adjust it as best you can with gentleness and ingenuity.
Know that it is easier to set and adjust a bone without splinters than one with splinters, then secure it as will be mentioned later. If the bone contains splinters, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Use your hands if the limb is small, or use two ropes, or combine a rope with your hands. Place the limb in a straight position that matches its natural shape so that when the parts of the broken bone align, you should carefully and gently return any protrusions to their proper places using whatever method you can manage.
Strive to avoid causing pain or discomfort to the patient with your actions. Aim to align one bone with its counterpart in the best possible manner, and at this time, feel and examine them with your hand. If you notice anything out of place, correct and adjust it as much as you can.
Avoid excessive stretching and strong pulling, as many unskilled people often do. Such actions frequently cause hot swelling or delay healing in the limb, as I have observed repeatedly due to their mistakes.
After setting, perfecting, and securing the limb, ensure that it remains still and at ease. Advise the patient to avoid moving the limb whether awake or asleep, during transitions or agitation, while defecating, and in all movements, as much as possible. Ensure the limb is positioned so that it does not cause pain.
This is because when he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position where he does not feel any pain, and he should ensure that this new position is even and straight.
To prevent the limb from becoming crooked when it is set, and as for how to pull a broken limb, I will describe that to you. Know that broken limbs vary in size, large or small, and their form; those that are smaller, such as the arm, finger, and wrist, and the like.
For smaller bandages, they should be soft and delicate. However, for tougher areas such as the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be wide and sturdy because a broad ligature is necessary for large limbs, providing even tension around it without any unevenness or misalignment.
Then after you finish adjusting, apply the appropriate plaster. Apply gentle pressure to the site of the fracture, then begin wrapping the bandage around the site of the fracture itself for three or four turns as needed by the limb. Slightly tighten the bandage with your hand and then move it towards the upper part of the fracture site.
Apply less tension than you applied to the fractured area, then move slightly away from the site of the fracture and gradually loosen the tension a little. Take a suitable piece from the correct place, then take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area as well.
Wrap for a few more turns, then move the wrapping to the lower part of the fracture. The tension and looseness of the wrap should be as described for the first upper wrapping. Then place gentle padding or cloth between the layers of bandages to straighten any misalignment of the fracture.
If it is crooked, do not put anything in it; then wrap another bandage around it, and then apply firm splints to these wrappings from your supplies if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something to reduce that swelling and dispel the puffiness, and leave it for several days; then at that time, secure the splints. The splints should be made of half sections of large reeds prepared with care, or they can be made of sieve wood.
Those that are made from pine resin, or date palm leaves, or strips of cloth, or rush matting, or similar materials available for this purpose. The width of each splint should be as described and in this particular shape.
Except that the splint placed directly on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, it should be made according to the size of the broken limb, whether large or small. The shape of the splint:.
Then secure the splints with another bandage as you did initially, and then tie them securely from above with strong threads as we mentioned regarding the binding; it should be tighter around the site of the fracture. The tighter the binding, the closer it is to the fracture; the farther from the fracture, the less tight the binding should be.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness; they should preferably be made of wet linen, because if the threads are thick, as inexperienced people often do by making them from strips of twisted linen, it is a great mistake.
Because the tensioning becomes uneven, and thin threads are not suitable because you cannot achieve the desired tension with them. It should not be less than a finger's width between one bandage and another.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the bandages after proper tensioning, place soft linen or fluffy wool underneath so that it does not cause any harm. As for when there is a fracture accompanied by a wound and a break in the skin occurs, we will discuss this separately.
Know that not every broken part should be bandaged from the first day. If the part is large, it should not be bandaged until after five or seven days, or more, depending on your assurance of avoiding the occurrence of a hot swelling.
This is the description of dressings used by earlier practitioners to treat fractures, dislocations, and other injuries. It is a general and brief dressing that stabilizes fractures and suits most temperaments, especially for children and women because it neither causes heat nor cold.
Take dust from the mill, which is the fine bran that sticks to the walls of the mill when grinding. Mix it as it is without sieving, using egg whites, and make the consistency neither too thick nor too thin, then apply it.
The description of another dressing for treating fractures, dislocations, and injuries: Take masha, ladan, aqakiya, rasan, mughat, and sugar from each ten dirhams; take mor and sadap from each five dirhams; and take athl twenty dirhams, and Armenian or Roman clay twenty dirhams. Pound everything and mix with water of thuja or with egg white if the patient’s constitution is delicate. Then use this dressing, for it is well composed; it quickly sets broken bones and suits most people due to its moderation.
The description of another dressing that is also beneficial for fractures and contusions: take ten dirhams each of sifted flour, fresh meat broth, and white poppy head; five dirhams each of rue and horehound in powder; six dirhams of Armenian clay; twenty dirhams which are all finely pounded and sieved, then mixed with water or egg white and used.
A dressing for joints and displaced bones to alleviate pain associated with them, as well as for bone concussion and fractures: take cleaned wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, then apply it to the affected area. This dressing does not have the strength to set bones.
However, it is excellent for reducing hot swelling and relieving pain in particular. The description of another dressing to set a broken bone: take the leaves of black mulberry and wild opium poppy, pound them together, and apply them wet as a dressing. Another brief dressing is used when a fracture has begun to heal.
To further resolve the remaining swelling, take the root of white poppy, chamomile, violets, and cornmeal in equal parts; pound them all together and mix with glue if the part is not irritated. If it is irritated, then mix with cilantro water or plain water and use it.
The description of another stronger dressing for resolving solid swelling that occurs when a bone is healing: take the root of white poppy, flax seeds, fenugreek, rosemary, myrtle, violets, and chamomile in equal parts from each.
All should be pounded and mixed with water from the river or with fresh water or with plaster, depending on the heat of the limb and its calmness; as for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that something should be placed on the broken limb when setting it.
Except for the Qirwatyi made of wax and oil, nothing else; he described it as being medium between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he thought that when setting a broken limb, things that are dry but have some heat should be applied, such as aloeswood, hellebore, frankincense, and the like as mentioned above.
A dressing for weakness and pain: Take mallow, lentils, human cut hair or bird feathers, okra, and equal parts of salt, all of which should be ground, sifted, mixed, and applied as a dressing. As for the amount that the bandage should allow to remain.
Then it should not be loosened until you observe; if the patient does not experience pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place, do not loosen it for many days. If severe itching occurs in the area, or painful anxiety, or swelling appears.
Then act promptly and loosen it at the time, do not delay; remove the dressing from it. Then take a soft cloth or sponge freely wetted and soak it in warm water, then wash the area with it until the itching subsides and the pain eases, then let the limb rest for an hour.
Then apply clean wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose fat, and bind it on for a night until you ensure that the hot swelling is prevented, the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain disappears. Then return to gentle binding and minimal dressing, do not tighten as you did initially.
Be gentle with him until he recovers. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need to apply a bandage or compress, prepare it as you did initially. If nothing has happened to the part as we mentioned.
Do not remove it except after three, four, five, or seven days, or even leave it for twenty days, all depending on what you see regarding the condition of the part as we have said, until the bone has united and the flesh is nearly healed around it.
At that time, also increase the compression more than your initial one and also increase the richness of the patient's diet as previously mentioned. If you see that the site of the fracture has dried up and wasted more than it should, then know that nourishment is unable to reach it.
So soak it in warm water each time you remove the bandage, and do this every three days. Also slightly reduce the compression, as this will facilitate nourishment reaching the part and promote quick healing. As for what ignorant bone setters do, causing the bone to break again.
If it does not heal properly at first and heals crookedly, then this is an error in their actions and a great danger. Even if it were correct, the early scholars would have mentioned it in their books and followed it, but I have seen none of them do so at all. The correct approach is not to follow it.
The Second Section.
On Contingent Fractures in the Head.
Types of accidental fractures in the head are many and their shapes differ, and their causes are diverse. Some fractures occur from a sword blow and may completely split the bone to reach the membrane beneath the bone. As when cleaving wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a cleaving fracture. It may also be that the sword cuts part of the bone but only splits its surface without penetrating through it; this type of fracture is called an avulsion. The wound caused by these fractures may be either large or small.
There are fractures that are comminuted or contused, caused by a blow from a stone or falling on a stone or similar objects. This type of fracture may either penetrate nearly to the membrane beneath the bone or be limited to the surface of the bone.
The wound caused by these fractures may also be either large or small. There are also hidden fractures in the bone, as thin as a hair, which is a slight concussion.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture. There is also a type that occurs from falling or being struck by a stone or similar objects, where the bone's surface is driven inward, much like how a metal pot develops an indentation when struck.
This most often occurs in the soft, pliable skulls of infants. There may be fragments that are displaced or not displaced for all these types of fractures, and we will discuss their treatment in due course. We will identify all these types of fractures through examination.
Examine it with probes and remove the diseased flesh from it. As for the hair-like type, it is recognized by exposing the bone and wiping and smearing ink on it; the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of fractures, first observe the symptoms of the patient.
If you see from his symptoms a clear indication of fear, such as vomiting bile, stretching out, loss of reason, loss of voice, fainting, severe fever, protrusion and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient or treat him, for with these symptoms death is inevitable in most cases.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his safety, then proceed with his treatment. This is the case when a wounded person comes to you at the beginning of his injury, especially if this occurs during the winter days.
It is essential to strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, in any case. If it is during the summer days, it is necessary to hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day so that what is under the bone, such as the membrane, does not become corrupted, thus avoiding those symptoms we have described.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is also comminution and contusion, it is necessary to cut away the fractured and contused part as I will describe to you. This involves shaving the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone from whichever side is convenient for you and according to the shape of the wound, and what causes least distress to the patient. If during the examination of the bone, bleeding or a hot swelling appears, address it appropriately.
It is that you fill the area with cloth soaked in syrup, rose oil, and fat; cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding is avoided, then proceed to scrape the bone or extract it, which can be done in one of two ways.
As for one method, you should cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed saw, and this is its illustration:.
Then use another saw after this one, slightly wider, and this is its illustration:.
Then use yet another saw, wider than the second one. It is necessary to have several different saws, some wider and some shorter than others, with extremely sharp edges; they should be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use a hammer to tap gently on the saw to avoid shaking the head and injuring it. If the bone is strong and hard, you should drill holes around it before using the saws with drills that are not deep, which they called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not penetrate beyond the thickness of the skull bone. The drill has a circular flange below its sharp head, resembling a ring or small circle that prevents it from penetrating further than the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills available, each suitable for the thickness of the bone. Each drill should match the length and width of its sharp tip to the thickness of that skull, so you are prepared with a suitable drill for every skull thickness. Here is an illustration of three types. Of punctures, large, medium, and small:.
As for the method of puncturing around a broken bone, you should place the puncture instrument on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the puncture instrument to another location. Leave a distance between each puncture equal to the thickness of a finger or something similar.
Then, cut between each two punctures using the appropriate tool with as much gentleness as possible, as we have said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with some other instrument that you have prepared for this purpose.
Use delicate tools such as cotton pads and clamps, and be extremely careful that the puncture or cutting instruments do not touch any surrounding tissues. Once you have removed the bone and separated it from adhered membranes if they were attached to it, you should clean and prepare the area thoroughly.
Smooth out any roughness remaining in the bone using another tool similar to a cutting instrument, but it should be thinner and more delicate than other cutting tools. If there are small pieces of bone or fragments left, gently remove them with the appropriate instruments you have.
Then, treat the wound afterward with bandages and ointments that will be mentioned. As for the other approach to this work, it is extremely simple and free from risk; Galen has described and highly praised it. This is his saying on the matter. First, you should start by exposing the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe. Once you have exposed that part, place one end of this lens-like cutting instrument under it. This is its shape:.
It should be smooth in its lens-like part so that it does not cut anything, and sharp on the sides extending in length as you see, so that the lens-like part rests against the diaphragm and the cutting edge of the section is applied to the bone; then strike the section from one side.
Using a small hammer until all the bone is cut gently as it turns, and you are safe from any frightening accident to the membrane, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly person in the world. Indeed, even if he were asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in certain areas, then scrape it off with the lens-like end of the cutting instrument itself and gently remove it; it will come away without harm or fear.
And if the bone fracture did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was broken off from the bone is rough with small splinters remaining in it, then you should remove that roughness and extract those splinters using fine probes of various sizes so that you can use whichever one fits best for each situation as dictated by your work.
And the same applies to the broken bone and its shape; you should use the widest of those probes first for removing roughness from the bone, then use one that is finer than it, and continue this process step by step until you reach the finest and thinnest probe.
As for the smaller hairline cracks and minor fractures, you should apply treatment to each one according to what leads to its healing. This is something that is not hidden from anyone who has even the slightest experience in this craft and has understood what we have written and clarified about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, you should take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound, dip it in rose oil, and place it over the mouth of the wound. Then take another folded or triangular cloth. Dip it in syrup and rose oil, then place it on the first cloth. Do this as lightly as possible so as not to burden the serosa. Then use a wide bandage on top but do not tighten it beyond what is necessary to secure the wound only.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling. Then loosen it and use after that medicines which have a drying effect, such as the root of saxifrage, powdered linseed, carthamus powder, safflower, and similar ones. Make an ointment from these drugs.
Apply it to the wound dry as it is. In general, use a medicine that cleanses without causing irritation. Strive to ensure that your treatment of the wound keeps it clean, free from grease and dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate in it at all.
Because if pus accumulates on the membrane of the brain, it will damage and corrupt it, causing great harm to the patient. This often occurs in the serosa of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if care is neglected in its treatment.
If there is blackness on its surface, observe if the patient exhibits the symptoms we have mentioned. If so, know that he is surely doomed. Even if the blackness occurred due to a medicine applied and had the potential to cause such discoloration.
Take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, then apply it to a piece of cloth and place it on the abdomen. Then treat it with various treatments as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the repair of the nose if it is broken.
Know that the upper part of the nose breaks entirely or partially on one side because it consists of two bones. The lower part, however, is cartilaginous and does not break; instead, it may suffer contusion, deformation, or perforation.
If one side breaks, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and align the break from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and ensure that your actions do not cause pain to the patient.
If the break is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, you should smooth it with the tip of a slender splint. If the break affects both sides, do the same. It is best to set it on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, do so; otherwise, wait until the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided. Then insert a thread of cotton cloth into the nostril if the break is on one side, or two threads if it is on both sides.
The threads should be of a thickness that fills the nostril. Some early surgeons mentioned soaking the threads in fat and changing them daily, but I do not see this as necessary. Instead, it is better to soak the threads in egg white mixed with flour dust.
Then leave the packing until the bone is set and the cartilage is firm, and you may insert into the nose for the site of the packing goose feathers wrapped in soft cloth, so that it prevents the fracture more effectively and so that the patient does not refuse to breathe.
This is not essential; if you wish, you may do it, or you can use dressings. If a hot swelling occurs in the nose during your work, apply a cerotic bandage or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or some ointment like diachylum.
If no hot swelling occurs, it is advisable to dress the outside with semolina and fenugreek flour mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage over it, and do not bind the nose at all. If the nasal bones are fractured slightly,
or if they are crushed, it is advisable to incise them and remove the fragments with a suitable instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with ointments that promote healing. If there is a wound inside the nose, it should be treated with dressings and lead tubes should be used. until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the reduction of the lower jaw when it is dislocated.
If the lower jaw is fractured but there is no accompanying wound, observe it. If the fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two parts and凹陷到内部，则其识别会较为容易。请重新提供需要翻译的原文，以便我可以准确地进行翻译。如果骨折仅在外侧并且没有分裂成两部分并向内凹陷，则其识别会较为容易。请确认是否需要进一步翻译或调整这段话。
It is appropriate, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand and lift the hump of the fracture gently from inside to outside.
Use your other hand from outside the bone to control and align it. If the jaw fracture is split into two parts, it should be pulled evenly from both sides until it is properly aligned. If there is overgrowth in the teeth, ...
or if they separate, secure them with gold or silver thread or a wire until you expect them to stay. Then place a kerchief on the broken jaw and put a folded cloth over it. Place a large, tight bandage or a piece of leather sole equal in length to the jaw over the cloth. Then tie it from above as you see fit, ensuring it aligns properly so that it does not come loose. Instruct the patient to remain quiet and still and give them soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in appearance, address it on the third day.
Then tie it from above as you see fit, ensuring it aligns properly so that it does not come loose. Instruct the patient to remain quiet and still and give them soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in appearance, address it on the third day. Then repair the dressing with flour sieved from a millstone mixed with egg whites or semolina, after removing the kerchief. Place a soft bandage over the dressing. As long as the dressing adheres and there is no change in the condition of the bone, leave it as it is.
Do not remove it until the injury is healed and the fracture has consolidated, as this often takes about three weeks. If inflammation with heat appears during this period, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to alleviate it until the swelling subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, you should examine it. If a piece or pieces of bone have become dislodged, handle their removal with care using whatever tool seems appropriate for the task. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with scissors as needed.
Then, after removing those pieces of bone and if nothing remains, outline the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that purpose. And sew the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the Treatment of the Clavicle When It Is Fractured.
The clavicle most often breaks in front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits into two parts without producing any fragments, which is easiest to treat.
Or it may produce fragments, which is more difficult to treat. If the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, you should have two assistants present: one to secure the arm adjacent to the broken clavicle, and the other to extend the neck toward the opposite side.
Then, straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, without any protrusions or misalignments. If more extension is needed, place a ball of cloth or cotton under the armpit of the patient.
Adjust the position of the clavicle as needed and extend it while lifting. Press on the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has moved inward, the patient should lie face down.
A pillow of medium height should be placed under his armpit, and the servant should press his armpit downwards so that the clavicle in the depth rises upwards. Then the fracture is corrected and smoothed with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should incise it and gently remove that fragment. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, devise a method to cut it using one of the tools prepared for this purpose. After placing the instrument that protects the viscera under the clavicle, which is made of wood or iron, and this is its image:.
It resembles a spoon without a bowl, and its width should be according to the size of the bone, whether large or small. As for its length, it should be appropriate for the work you need to do. It should have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you can see.
If the wound you incised when removing a bone fragment is wide and there is no risk of inflammation, then sew the edges of the wound together. If the wound is small or if you fear inflammation, dress the wound with a bandage, the size of which should be proportional to the size of the incision.
If inflammation occurs, apply the wound with rose oil and vinegar or drink, and treat it accordingly. As for setting a bone without a wound or incision, wrap the bone with a dressing made from flour powder mixed with egg whites. Place a soft bandage on it, then place a ball under his armpit if necessary. Then take a long scarf, about an inch wide or so, and wrap a folded bandage over the padding and dressing. Finally, take a splint made from a thin piece of wood. Its width should be three fingers, and in length it should be the same. Then wrap it in a cloth, then wrap that cloth along with the splint in the part of the turban that covers the site of the fracture, then tighten the turban around the fracture as it rotates. Place it around his neck and under his healthy armpit and under the affected armpit, and wrap it several times on each side. And you know well how tightening it properly controls the fracture securely, as this is not hidden from you.
The main goal is that the splint should not move from the broken bone. For this reason, it is necessary to check on the patient every day. Whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, fix it and tighten the bandage. Then make sure the patient sleeps on his back and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
To raise his shoulder off the side so that the fracture of the collarbone rises with the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless an incident such as itching or swelling occurs in the area after twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see that it is necessary to do so. Tighten it and leave it until the fracture heals and becomes complicated. The clavicle fracture becomes more severe and stronger after twenty-eight days. It may also occur in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the setting of a broken shoulder. The shoulder is rarely broken in its broad part; rather, it is broken at its edges. Whenever a part of it breaks or breaks in the middle, and this can only be known by touch. According to the shape of the break, treatment should be administered.
Smooth it and restore it to its natural shape by any means possible, then apply dust from a millstone mixed with egg white and soft wax. Place over this a folded cloth pad, then put on a wide splint made of wood.
Make the splint as wide as the shoulder or slightly wider. If there is a depression under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth out that depression with soft wax so that the splint lies flat. Then secure it from above with a long headcloth.
Secure it firmly and make sure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved. Let the patient lie on their healthy side. The shoulder will heal in twenty days.
It may take one day or twenty-five days. Once this period is complete, remove the bandage with confidence, for it is among bones that are not feared to be crushed or fractured. If a bone shard protrudes and irritates under the skin, cut into it and extract the shard. And follow what was mentioned regarding the fracture of the collarbone for soothing any hot swelling that may occur.
Chapter Seven.
On healing a broken rib.
The chest may be fractured in the middle, but this is rare. Its sides are more likely to be broken and fragmented. If the middle part is fractured, it will tilt downward, causing severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
It may also cause bleeding, and the fracture in the bone becomes evident. To treat it, the patient should lie on their back with a pillow placed between their shoulders. Then, press their armpits, gather the ribs with hands from both sides, and carefully align them as much as possible.
Continue until the shape of the bone returns to its proper form. Then, apply bandages and a splint. Place a splint made from a thin piece of lime wood or cypress, or something similar that is light, wrapped in cloth over it. Then carefully secure it to the broken bone so that it does not shift. Pass the bandage around the curvature several times and tie it tightly, then check the bandage at all times and retighten it whenever it loosens.
If the need arises to remove it during eating due to pain, swelling, or discomfort in the area, immediately loosen it and remove the bandage. Address any issues that arise with appropriate treatment, then replace the bandage if necessary. And keep it tight until he is healed.
Chapter Eight.
On healing broken ribs. It is known that fractures occur in the ribs in the thick parts near the back, while their front ends are more likely to suffer contusions because they are cartilaginous. This can be easily discerned by touch when examining with fingers.
Repair it by aligning the fracture with your fingers until the shape is properly set, then bandage it. If necessary, secure the broken bone with a splint. If the fractured ribs are inclined inward, severe pain will occur in the injured person.
And in cases where the protrusion is like a sharp projection, it presses against the membrane causing severe difficulty in breathing and coughing, as well as expelling large amounts of blood. This condition is difficult to treat, and the early practitioners devised many ingenious solutions for it.
Some have said that the patient's diet should consist of foods that produce gas and bloating, causing the abdomen to expand and push the fracture outward. We disagree with this approach because it may confirm the development of a hot swelling. If such a swelling has not yet occurred, it might induce its formation; if it has already developed, it will exacerbate and reinforce it.
Some suggest placing a leech on the affected area and sucking it forcefully, which seems to follow reasonable logic, though there is concern that the weakened state of the area might cause excessive bleeding. Others have suggested covering the area with wool soaked in hot oil.
It should be packed between the ribs until it is full, so that when wrapped around, the bandage lies smoothly. Then, treat the patient for a protrusion with appropriate diet and medication, as severe discomfort may make it unbearable for the patient. The bone was pressing painfully against the membrane, and we were concerned for the patient's safety. Therefore, it is necessary to make an incision at the site and expose the broken rib, then place a device that protects the serosa as previously described, carefully cut the bone, and remove it.
Then we stitch together the edges of the wound if it is large and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during this time, apply bandages soaked in rose oil to the area and also treat the patient internally with remedies that reduce the swelling.
He should lie on the side that is more comfortable for him until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
On the Repair of Spinal and Neck Vertebrae.
As for the neck bones, if they sustain a fracture, which is rare, but more commonly they suffer contusions. The same applies to the vertebrae of the spine. If this occurs and you wish to determine whether recovery is possible or not. Observe if his hands have become weak, numb, and lifeless, unable to move, stretch, or grasp. If you prick them with a needle and he does not feel it or experience pain, know that in most cases he will not recover and is likely to perish.
If, however, he can move them and feel the prick or touch, then know that the spinal cord is safe and the patient will recover with treatment. If a vertebra in the spine is similarly affected and you wish to determine whether recovery is possible or not,
Examine his legs; if you see that they have become weak and exhibit the same symptoms as the hands, and when he lies on his back, gas and feces are expelled involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine is released involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and is unable to urinate, know that he is doomed; therefore, do not bother with treating him. If none of this occurs to him, then the situation is less serious. The treatment for what has occurred is to aim at calming the hot tumor.
Apply rose oil alone or mixed with roasted egg yolks to the injured vertebra three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply one of the reinforcing and drying bandages, secure it with a cloth strip, and instruct him to rest and remain quiet.
He should not sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed. If a fragment of bone or something else has become loose due to the injury, you should cut through the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then bring the edges of the wound together if it is large by suturing and treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the sacrum, which is the coccyx, is fractured, you should insert your left thumb into the coccyx.
Align the broken bone with the other hand as well as you can, then apply a bandage and splint if necessary, and secure it.
If you feel a broken fragment in it, cut through the tissue and remove it, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the Treatment of Hip Fractures.
Rarely are the bones of the spine broken; if they are broken, it is because they fracture at their ends and split lengthwise, tilting inward. This causes pain in the affected area, bruising, and numbness in the leg on the side where the break occurred.
To treat it, run your hand over it until you locate the fracture and determine its shape. If the fracture is only at the ends, smooth out the break as best you can so that its shape resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach so you can set the fracture. Once it is smoothed out, wrap it with bandages and then apply a splint made of wood or leather, securing it tightly.
Do not fear that the fracture will move or that the splint will shift. Adjust the padding from the flanks to ensure even compression, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on the correct side. If a hot swelling occurs,
stop stretching and treating it until the swelling subsides, and apply what is necessary to reduce the swelling as previously described. Then return to properly setting and securing it. If there are shards or fragments in the bone or at its ends, they should not be removed.
Do not disturb it; instead, smooth it from the outside as we have said and leave it to heal without further manipulation.
Chapter Eleven.
On the Treatment of a Fractured Humerus.
The elbow joint is what lies between the forearm and the top of the shoulder. If it is broken, it should be set in one of two ways. One way is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness as shown in this illustration:.
Then two straps are tied to its ends, and it is hung from a high place while the patient sits on a chair. The broken arm is then placed on the stick until the armpit is pressed against the middle of the curve. Then something heavy is suspended above it.
Or a servant can extend it downward, then the doctor sets the fracture with both hands until the break is properly aligned. The other method is to have the patient lie face down and suspend his hand from his neck with a strap.
Then order two servants to control the area above and below the fracture with their hands, one for each side. If you want a stronger extension, secure the area under and over the fracture with straps, and have each servant pull in opposite directions.
If the fracture is near the shoulder end, the strap should be placed under the armpit with the other part beneath the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the straps should be placed over that area and on the elbow itself.
Then align the fracture gently without force until it is properly set and well-aligned. If no inflammatory swelling appears, apply compression; if it does, wait until the seventh day to compress it. Place a moistened cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil on it.
Until the swelling subsides, then at that time bind it; the method of binding is to carry the bandage over the fracture, then place a strip of new cloth on top of the bandage, then bring the arm together with the shoulder, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And place the bandages and binding on the shoulder and arm so that the arm serves as a substitute for splints, unless something prevents you from doing so or there is no change in the broken bone. If you fear any change in the condition of the broken bone, then use splints.
This means placing a splint directly over the fracture that is wider and stronger than other splints, with a space of one finger's width between each splint. The length of the splints should be according to the length of the fracture, adding three finger-widths on each side.
Then bind the splints with the binding method mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
It should be that your binding is tighter around the site of the fracture.
The binding should be less tight as it moves away from the fracture. If you see that placing the splints and binding as we have described is appropriate when setting the limb, then do so.
If you fear a hot swelling, then leave the binding and splints until the seventh day as we have said. Then check the ligature every three days to ensure there is no itching, swelling, or obstruction of nutrition reaching the limb due to excessive binding. Adjust this as described.
If you are confident that none of these issues will occur, then do not loosen the ligature except after many days. The patient should lie on their back with their hand on their stomach, and a cushion filled with wool should be placed under the armpit to support it properly.
Examine at all times, whether day or night, to ensure that the shape of the broken limb does not deteriorate or that the ligaments do not become lax; correct all of this with your effort. Make the diet of the patient as we have recommended, initially making it light so that when the bone is ready to strengthen, it can do so.
You should then make his diet more substantial, for it is customary for the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days. At that time, he should be allowed to bathe and treated with ointments suitable for this purpose. If the fracture is severe and comminuted.
Do not release the bandage for fifty days or even up to two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the Healing of a Broken Arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, known as the ulna and the radius. One is smaller and is adjacent to the thumb, while the other is larger and is situated below the smaller one. It may happen that only the larger bone (the ulna) breaks, or only the smaller bone (the radius) breaks, or both may break simultaneously.
When the upper smaller bone (radius) breaks, its healing is easier and recovery is faster. When the lower larger bone (ulna) breaks, the fracture is poor and recovery is difficult. The worst case is when both bones break simultaneously. If it is the bone where the upper smaller bone (radius) has broken,
The physician, when setting it, should make the extension slight and gently until it is even. If the larger bone (ulna) is broken, a stronger extension should be made. If both bones are broken simultaneously, an extremely strong extension should be applied.
It is appropriate to place the hand in a position when setting and extending it, lying flat on a cushion with the thumb raised higher than all the fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient sitting cross-legged.
And let the cushion be at his level in height so that the patient does not strain himself.
Then a helper extends the arm from below, either by hand or with a strap, and another helper does the same from above. Then the doctor aligns the bone until it is in the best possible position. If there are shards in the fractured bone, they must be removed.
Place each shard in its proper place to the best of your ability. If a free-floating shard appears that is piercing the skin and cannot be set, then cut it out according to the method described previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have devoted a separate section to it.
Refer to that section for treatment. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of setting the fracture, apply a bandage made of quilted cloth worked with rose oil and white beeswax, neither too thick nor too thin, and wrap it tightly enough so that when the swelling subsides.
Remove the quilted bandage and apply a dressing prepared from flour dust mixed with egg white, then secure it with splints. The splint placed directly over the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger. Know that in most cases, the number of splints for the arm is six at most.
Whether the fracture is in one ulna or both, make your bandaging tighter and stronger at the site of the fracture. Whenever you wrap upwards or downwards, make the wrapping slightly looser as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Let the patch that is wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not too hard. And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, medium between thinness and thickness as we have described, and examine the part and ligature after days.
If something needs to be fixed, such as itching that occurs in the part, it is necessary to unwrap the part with warm water until the itching subsides and then leave the part unbound for a night so that it may rest, then resume binding.
If the binding has become loose or the bone has shifted or something similar, fix all of it to the best of your ability. Also observe if the nutrition is unable to reach the part due to excessive binding; then you should loosen it slightly and leave it for days until the nutrition flows to it, then bind it again.
If nothing mentioned above occurs to the patient, it is not advisable to remove the binding until after twenty days or so. Then hang the patient's arm around his neck and let his arm be in a moderate position, and guard against erratic movements with all his effort, and make his sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two, or it may be healed in twenty-eight days, all depending on the conditions of the humors and states of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the Healing of Fractures of the Hand and Fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges are rare, while contusions are common. When a fracture or contusion occurs to the hand,
The patient should sit upright on a chair that is level.
Then he places his hand on it, extended. The servant then extends the broken bone while the doctor aligns it until it fits well together. At this point, the bandage and splint should be applied if no hot swelling has occurred, then a plaster cast is applied from above as needed for the location.
If it has been wrapped in a soft piece of cloth, and if the fracture is towards the palm side, make a ball-like shape with the cloth and have the patient grasp it with their injured hand, then secure it with a long strip of cloth.
The plaster cast should be made of leather that has some flexibility so that the skin can move with the bending of the entire hand, and it should be secured appropriately. If the fracture is on the outer side, a plaster cast should be placed from above and another one from below the wrist to keep the hand open and upright.
Then apply the bandage as the hand is wrapped and tie between the fingers with a lace. If the fracture affects one of the phalanges, especially the thumb, align it properly and secure it with the hand bandage. If desired, you can also make a small separate splint to stabilize the fracture.
Do not move it. If the fracture is in other fingers such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, align them and secure them with the next healthy finger or bind all of them together, which is better, or place a small separate splint on them.
As we said for the thumb, check for any hot swelling both during and after setting the fracture. Address it appropriately as described previously if such a condition occurs.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the repair of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone is often fractured and can be detected by sensation because it moves both forward and backward. Its repair involves binding a ligature above the fracture and another below it, with the patient lying face up.
Then each ligature is stretched by an assistant on its side with moderation. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone; however, if it is near the base of the thigh, a soft ligature, such as from wool or something similar, should be applied.
Near the base of the thigh towards the groin so that the stretching is upwards, and the other ligature below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the ligature should be near the knee so that the stretching is downwards. Then, the physician should adjust the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well; therefore, the bandages and compression should be maintained unless a hot swelling occurs in the limb. If such a swelling does occur, leave it for days until the swelling subsides, then resume treatment.
As for the compression, a wide, firm bandage should be wound around the fracture twice or three times, leaving any excess. Then wrap the leg so that the heel is at the base of the calf and pass a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread emerging from above on both sides.
Then wrap the remaining bandage around the leg and thigh. Place plaster casts directly over the fracture site on the thigh, and another cast on the shinbone. Then stuff the space between the thigh and the leg with soft fabric to ensure even compression.
Then begin with a strong binding from the middle over the site of the fracture, three or four times around, and as you move the bandage farther away from the site of the fracture, your binding should be less tight and softer.
Then, take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie it to the splints above. Then pass the ends of the thread down until you reach the heel of the foot, and also tighten them with the splints on the other side.
To prevent the bandage from shifting from its place, leave it on as long as there is no discoloration, swelling, or puffiness in the affected area. If any of these symptoms occur, immediately loosen it and correct everything that has happened, as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a sharp piece of bone causing irritation, it should be smoothed if possible. If not, incise the area and remove it, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture may also be stabilized from the thigh without adding splints to the leg.
As we mentioned for the forearm and arm, however, if it is set in this way, it does not cause the patient to limp. If you set it alone without adding the leg to it, the patient will inevitably limp forever.
Know that the thigh takes about fifty days to heal, or a little more or less, depending on differences in temperament and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the Fracture of the Knee Joint.
The knee joint is rarely fractured, but it often sustains bruises. If a fracture does occur, it will either be a split or fragmentation of its parts, whether accompanied by a wound or not.
You can determine all of this by touch. To set it, align the dispersed parts with your fingers until they come together and fit properly as much as possible, then apply a bandage and if necessary, place a circular splint on top.
It should be securely fastened from above as appropriate, then all conditions described in the treatment of other fractures, such as hot swelling and similar issues, should be attended to by addressing each symptom appropriately until recovery.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the Treatment of a Fractured Leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick called the thigh bone, and the other thin called the shin bone. Both are susceptible to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm. Therefore, treating it is like treating the arm, and the procedure is the same. If both bones are fractured, the leg will turn in all directions. If only the thinner bone is broken, the leg will turn forward. If the thicker bone is broken, especially from below, this should be obvious to you.
Use traction and alignment, and bind the splints accordingly. However, if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the traction should be gentler and you should proceed carefully in setting it.
And in the treatment of the leg there is something additional compared to the arm, which is that when you have set the splints and completed all your work, take two handfuls of pine splinters used for smoothing the gaps between planks or made from date palm leaves or similar material.
Choose from them pieces that are neither too thick nor too thin, and let their length be from the knee to the bottom of the leg. Then wrap two layers of cloth around each piece, one on the side of the leg and the other on the opposite side.
From the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the two handfuls in three places at each end and in the middle. This will prevent the leg from tilting to the right or left and will ensure good immobilization. A groove made of wood can also be used along the length of the leg.
It should be placed in it to keep it from moving, especially when there is a wound with the fracture. Then check the leg every day with great care for swelling or puffiness or other signs. Whenever any of these signs appear, counter them appropriately until healing occurs. The bone of the leg heals in about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Fractures of the Leg Bones and Fingers.
As for the heel, it is never fractured. As for the leg bones, they may be fractured, but fingers rarely suffer fractures; rather, they usually experience contusions in most cases.
If a man's bones are fractured and you see those bones protruding toward one another, then let the patient stand on his foot upright as if he were walking, then place your foot on the part that has risen from those bones and press them down and smooth them.
Until they return to their proper places, then take the bandage and support; place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot, then bind the foot tightly after wrapping it with cloth and all other necessities.
After three or four days, loosen the ligature; you will find the bones level whether they were broken or dislocated. The treatment is as described, and if any of the fingers are fractured, brace them and set them as described for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger that extends along the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than the finger. Place under the foot the board I described to you and bind it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are broken.
Make a splint for each finger, slightly grooved in a soft cloth, and bind the board securely at the bottom of the foot. Let each end of the board protrude slightly beyond the arch of the foot to provide good support.
You should not forget to attend to all the symptoms we have mentioned for other fractures as well, and counter each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of a woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vagina is fractured, seat her in a squatting position, then gradually lean her towards her back little by little. Then the midwife should fill her vagina with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball inside her vagina.
Then shake the woman and gradually raise her hips little by little, for that cotton will come out until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of her vagina, thus healing the bone fracture. Then place a cushion on her back; when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently so she can urinate.
Return it in the same manner as it was first inserted, then return to her original cushion. Do this for seven days or so until it is healed. If you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach a tube to its mouth, then insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside the vagina, as this will help the fracture to heal. Then fill it with cotton and keep her for days on what has been described until she is healed. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, use these methods to set it.
And smoothing it out is as described for the hip bone. The proper approach to these rare fractures, which rarely occur, especially for those who have some experience and understand this book well, should not be hidden from you. The fracture itself will often guide you in most cases.
Follow the correct method for setting and securing it, so understand. As for a man when his thigh is fractured, if you insert a goose neck into it, then wrap it with a bandage and bind it; leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the healing of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is advisable for one who encounters a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the thigh bone or the humerus or similar, to proceed immediately to extract it if the conditions for extraction assist you, as we have presented before.
If the wound is bleeding, it is advisable to proceed by applying a powdered substance like "zaj" (a type of plaster) if nothing else is available, and then proceed with setting the fracture on that same day without delaying.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if a hot swelling does occur, delay setting it until the ninth day so that the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, as doing so would lead to adverse outcomes.
If the broken bone is protruding on the skin and exposed, it is advisable to gently attempt to push it back and smooth it with your hands gradually. If you are unable to do so with your hands, then use a tool made of iron, which should be about seven or eight finger breadths in length. And adjust its size according to the wound.
Therefore, it is advisable for the physician to prepare three or four of these tools, according to what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture. They should be rounded and slightly thick so that they do not bend when pressure is applied during work.
They should be sharp at one end with a bend, and the top part should be thicker while from the middle to the bottom it should be very thin. This is its shape:.
It is called in Greek "perne," meaning a small lever. It should be made so that its curved sharp end fits the protruding part of the bone, and with it, push once to make the bone return and partially realign itself, then use it to even out the broken ends against each other.
If the broken end is thin and not properly grasped by the instrument, it should be cut so that the instrument can grasp it. If it is impossible to realign the bone as described, then cut it in a manner similar to what has been mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the files as much as possible, then smooth out any roughness or thin layers left in the bone. If you realign the bone and the patient experiences severe painful discomfort after realignment, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, do so, for you will provide great benefit to the patient. When you have completed setting the bone, soak a cloth in a contracting black liquid and especially do this if it is summer. Do not place a ceroty or anything with oil on the wound.
To prevent rot and corruption from occurring, then apply splints after you have set the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting appropriate holes in the bandages with scissors over the wound.
Be extremely cautious not to tighten the wound along with the fracture, for many ignorant doctors have done this and caused either death or consumption or catarrh in their patients. Your tightening should be gentle and relaxed, contrary to how other fractures are tightened.
If the wound is poor or if it is large and you fear some of the harmful symptoms we have described, and he feels painful anxiety in the area, then you should not apply splints but make firm bandages from cloth in the place of the splints and secure them.
If, after one or two days, you see that the wound has begun to produce pus, then remove the dressing that was placed on it with a decoction, and then use bandages and ointments that we usually use to treat wounds, such as the quadruple ointment and similar ones, and you should loosen the ligature.
Examine the wound every morning and evening until it heals, and you should position the limb so that pus can easily drain downward. If many days pass and the wound does not heal or the pus does not stop flowing, then know that there are small bone fragments present.
You should probe the wound with an instrument; whatever of those fragments is loose, remove and extract it. Whatever is not loose and causes irritation and pain to the limb, crush and remove it by any means possible.
If the wound develops pus, decay, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each condition with a corresponding treatment as described earlier in its section.
When a large bone such as the femur or humerus is fractured and affects the limb, you must not attempt to pull or extract it. Often, attempting to do so can lead to death, so leave it and allow it to become infected; perhaps it will naturally discharge after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see room for treatment, otherwise leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of complications that occur after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near joints, deforming the shape of the limb and sometimes preventing it from performing its natural function.
If you examine the complication and find it soft, use astringent medicines such as sage, frankincense, aloes, galangal, and hellebore, or similar remedies. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent decoction, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with effort and wrap it tightly, leaving it on for many days without removing it. Then remove it and repeat with another treatment until the complication subsides, if God wills, or you can secure a sheet of lead tightly around it.
Lead has a property that removes all that has settled in the limbs. If the complication has become hardened and severe, and the need arises to remove it, make an incision at its top and cut off the protruding part or strip it with some forceps until it is removed, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the treatment of fractures when they have healed but the limb remains thin and not as it was originally.
If the bones are set and the part remains thin and weak afterwards, this is due to many reasons. One reason may be due to the excessive loosening and improper retightening of ligaments, or it may be because of over-tightening the ligaments so that nourishment cannot reach the part. Another reason could be excessive stretching, or performing overly vigorous movements at inappropriate times, or there may be a lack of blood in the patient's body and weakness.
The treatment for this involves nourishing the patient and strengthening their body until the blood increases within it. Using baths, bringing joy and happiness to the patient, and similar methods should be employed. Then apply pitch to the affected part so that it attracts abundant nutrition, or use warm water for gentle stretching. Until the nourishment flows through it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the Treatment of Broken Bones That Are Set Crooked and Prevent Their Proper Function.
When a part that has been set after healing becomes crooked, or the broken bone protrudes, or the appearance of the part becomes deformed and ugly. Unless the part is prevented from its natural function, it is not appropriate to accept the claim that the bone should be broken again from the joint, as many ignorant physicians and bone setters used to do this in our country.
This action is highly reprehensible and can lead to significant risks, with the easiest consequence being damage. However, if the crookedness and deformation are still soft, it should be gently stretched with water in which relaxing herbs have been boiled, such as mallow leaves and roots, chamomile, and similar plants.
It is treated with relaxing dressings such as well-made diascorides, or saliva from the root of the snail is taken and mixed with chicken fat and schirj oil, then it is dressed with it, or fatty figs are taken and crushed with pigeon droppings and similar medicines known as ulcer-breaking remedies.
And to dissolve the stiffness, constant gentle massage with the hands is used, along with moving the limb in all directions at all times. If the curvature has advanced and hardened, and iron must be used for its treatment due to necessity.
It is necessary to incise it above and release the bone connection, cutting any excess stiffness or bone with gentle cuts, using care and attention. Then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is when one of the joints dislocates from its proper position, impeding movement, deforming the appearance of the part, and causing severe pain to the patient. When it occurs in anyone, it is necessary to immediately act to reduce it back into place.
It must never be delayed, for if it is, the area will swell and become hard to reduce. Therefore, it should not be delayed or moved when swollen, as this often causes painful spasms and discomfort to the patient.
However, if this happens, it is necessary to immediately bleed the patient, then leave them until the swelling subsides slightly. Then, the part should be treated with hot water and oil, and gently reduced back into place. Each part should be treated as described in its respective section.
I have also arranged the chapters on fractures in the same order as those for wounds, from top to bottom of the body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
Dislocation of the jaw is rare, and it occurs in two ways: either the bones move slightly from their positions and become relaxed a little, or they dislocate completely, causing full relaxation. Until it reaches the chest area, causing saliva to flow out and the patient is unable to hold it back; he cannot close his jaw or speak properly. If the dislocation is slight, in most cases, it can return to its normal position by itself with minimal effort.
If the dislocation is complete, it should be promptly reduced without delay. This is done by having an attendant hold the patient's head while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side.
Or if the dislocation is on both sides, he inserts both thumbs inside the mouth and uses his other fingers from outside to guide it. He then instructs the patient to relax their jaw and move it freely in all directions, while the physician guides the jaw back into place.
If it is difficult to reduce the dislocation, especially if both jaws are involved, use bandages with hot water and ointment to make reduction easier. Do not delay in reducing them as we have said. Once they are back in place and the patient's mouth has closed without any relaxation, then apply compresses made from cloths soaked in a mixture of wax, oil, and pitch.
Then tie it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head propped up between two pillows so that he does not move to the right or left, nor strain to chew anything, but rather make his food liquid and soft.
Until the pain subsides and his jaw heals, let him eat whatever he wishes but do so gently; he must not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until his jaw is healed and he is fully recovered.
If the jaws are difficult to reposition when they become dislocated and do not return to their proper places, it often results in fevers, persistent headaches, and sometimes causes the patient's abdomen to be upset, or leads to repeated vomiting. If you see these symptoms, know that the condition is serious and damaging.
And it often happens that a person dies from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Repositioning the Clavicle and the End of the Shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate inward due to its connection with the chest, but it can dislocate outward and this can be detected by touch. To set it, the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the dislocated area with your palm firmly, and it will return to its place. Then apply a bandage and dressing and secure it tightly. As for the end of the clavicle near the shoulder joint, it rarely dislocates; however, if it does, it should be repositioned as described and adjusted as you see fit.
Then apply the bandage, padding, and compression, and instruct the patient to rest and remain still until he recovers. With this same treatment, you should also address the displacement of the shoulder when it has also moved from its proper position.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Reducing the Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: the first is when it dislocates toward the armpit downward; the second is when it dislocates toward the chest; and rarely, it may dislocate above the shoulder.
It does not dislocate to the back due to the position of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front due to the presence of the nerve. It most commonly dislocates and moves downward toward the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, as it dislocates quickly and reduces quickly in them.
As for those with abundant flesh, it is the opposite; meaning that it dislocates with difficulty and reduces with difficulty. And sometimes a person may receive a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become hot, leading them to believe that it has dislocated. It is necessary to examine this carefully to determine its true condition.
At that time, proceed with its treatment. To identify a dislocation downward toward the armpit, if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the healthy one, you will find a clear difference between them. You will notice an indentation at the head of the dislocated shoulder, and when you touch under the armpit, you will feel the head of the shoulder like an egg.
The patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear or to move it in any way, and similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, you will find this evident to the touch, not hidden.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if the bone is soft or the patient is a child. To reduce it, have a servant raise his hand above, and place your thumbs under the armpit, then lift the joint forcefully to its proper position while the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then gently guide it downwards, and it will quickly return to its place. If it does not return as mentioned above, and the dislocation has been there for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and use a decoction that relaxes and softens, such as cooking the root of colocynth, fenugreek, and lemon balm in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and a ball of wool is placed under his armpit, which should be moderately firm. The physician then places the patient's heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand with his own, extending it downwards.
The physician pushes the ball with his foot; it will return to its proper place. If you prefer, reduce it in this manner: have a man taller than the patient stand on one side and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit, lifting the armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another servant should pull the patient's hand downwards towards his abdomen. If the patient is light, it is advisable to attach something to make him heavier; then the jaw will return immediately. It can also be reduced in another manner.
It is that you focus on the ground a long piece of wood whose head is round like the pestle, not too thick nor too thin, then place it under the armpit of the patient after placing a soft cloth on top of the wooden head. The patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then extend his hand downward from the other side and also stretch his body forcefully from the other side, for the joint will return to its place quickly. If it is difficult to do so with all of what has been mentioned, use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is four fingers, and its thickness is two fingers, it should have a round head to facilitate its entry into the armpit's depth as shown in this illustration:.
Then tie a soft cloth around the round head to prevent the wood from harming the patient. Place it under the armpit, extend the entire hand and arm downward along the wood, and secure the wood against the shoulder, forearm, and hand.
Then place the arm on a crossbeam. Support with the beam and extend the hand downward while leaving the rest of the body hanging from the other side, for the joint will enter promptly. Once it has entered in whatever manner possible, you should place under the armpit a moderate-sized ball of wool.
Then the prepared bandage, made from flour dust mixed with frankincense and egg whites, is applied all over the shoulder as it wraps around. Then tightly secure the ball under the armpit and tie the bandages firmly over it. Finally, suspend his hand to his neck.
He should leave it unmoved for seven days, and it is best to give the patient a light diet so that the limb becomes stronger, which will speed its healing. Then after either seven or five days, he should train it with movement; if it remains stable and does not weaken, then it has healed.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture affecting it or another reason, cauterization with three superficial burns should be used as previously described in the section on cauterization. If you have done all of this and released the ligament after seven days but the joint remains unstable.
And if you repeatedly apply bandages and compression but it does not stabilize, and it falls and becomes loose, and you cannot raise it above, then know that the nerve in the shoulder joint has been severed or stretched or loosened. Then know that the joint will never remain stable in its place.
As for the jaw that is toward the chest and breast and to the back, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns, and all forms of bandaging and treatment should be used until it heals. If stiffness occurs in the limb and movement becomes slower after healing.
Let the patient frequently use the bath to soften that stiffness and return it to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the Treatment of the Elbow Joint.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and it also returns with difficulty. It can dislocate in all directions, especially forward or backward. Its reduction is not hidden from you because it occurs under observation and palpation, to any form of dislocation.
When you join the dislocated elbow with the sound one, it becomes clearly apparent by the deformation of the joint, and he is unable to bend his arm or touch his shoulder with it. You should immediately reduce the dislocation before a hot swelling affects him.
If a hot swelling affects him, it will be difficult to reduce the dislocation, and he may never fully recover, especially if the dislocation is towards the back; this is the worst type of dislocation among all types and causes the most severe pain, often leading to death.
To reduce it if it can be returned, have a servant extend both his arms with his hands outstretched. The physician places his hands above and below the elbow, pushing the joint with his thumbs together or with the base of his palm until it returns to its proper place.
As for a dislocation towards the front, it may be reduced by bending the hand once and striking the base of the palm against the shoulder that is opposite. If this does not suffice to return the joint, use extreme force, which involves two servants extending the arm.
Two servants should also hold the patient to prevent movement during the extension. Then, after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide piece of fabric around his arm, if the physician handles the joint with his hands, he should smear it with oil to facilitate easy sliding of the joint.
Then, push the joint forcefully until it returns to its place. After it has returned, a bandage that includes compressing and drying should be applied, along with egg whites, and tightly secured. The arm should then be suspended from the patient's neck for several days.
Then release it. If the joint is firmly in place, free the ligament but leave it alone; if you see that the joint has not yet become firm and well-set, replace the bandage and ligature and leave it for days until it becomes firm, then remove it. If swelling occurs after the return of the joint and its release.
If movement is difficult, let him use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and kneading until it becomes soft; or place a thick leather casing from a fat ram on the joint, then secure it and leave it for a day and night. Then remove it and have him enter the bath. When he sweats, rub the joint moderately with his sweat.
Then reapply the leather casing once, twice, and three times with baths until it softens. If you wish to apply moistened ox dung mixed with fat and secure it, do so repeatedly; it will soften and return to its original condition.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the Treatment of the Wrist Joint.
The wrist often dislocates and it is easier to reduce its joint compared to other joints, except that it is necessary to promptly reduce the joint at the moment it dislocates before it becomes displaced or a hot swelling occurs.
To reduce the joint, place the patient's wrist on a board and have an assistant extend their hand. The physician should place their hand on the protruding part of the joint and push it until it returns, but it is necessary to observe whether the joint has moved to the palm side.
Let the patient place his hand on the board during traction and counter-traction; if the jaw protrudes toward the palm, let him place his inner hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls directly on the joint. If it returns [to its proper position] at this point, otherwise bind it with a bandage to reduce swelling.
Leave it and do not attempt to readjust it, for it cannot bear such treatment and you will not be able to return it after a few days; unless the joint remains in its proper position, it does no harm to the patient except if the hand relaxes and is unable to grasp anything.
At that moment, you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised; there is no remedy for it except to cauterize it, which may be helpful or may not benefit at all. Once the wrist has been realigned, apply the bandage as described and secure it, then leave it for five days.
Then remove the bandage and train the hand. If its movement is difficult and stiffness appears, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the Treatment of Finger Joints.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction. When a finger dislocates towards the palm or the back of the hand, extend the finger and push the joint with your thumb until it returns to its place, then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it toward the direction in which it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend it so that it becomes aligned over the course of that day. If at night, bind it as described; during the day, continue to remove the bandage and train it with movement, and rebind it at night. Repeat this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same if it becomes dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it in the same direction as before, and proceed as you did at first until it heals. Do this also whenever it becomes dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Treatment of Spinal Vertebra Dislocation.
When a vertebra of the spine or neck becomes completely dislocated, or when many vertebrae are displaced from their proper positions, there is no treatment because death quickly follows for the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excretion comes out involuntarily, and they are unable to control it. Often, some of their limbs become weak or paralyzed, either both legs, or one or both arms. If a single vertebra is displaced from its proper position, it often leads to further displacement.
It can dislocate in four directions: if it moves backward, it is called a hunchback. As for its treatment, one must observe: if the hunchback occurred during childhood, there is no cure and it will never heal. However, if it occurred due to a fall or a blow or something similar.
They have described various treatments for it at length, but most of them do not yield much benefit. I have summarized the essentials that suffice and explained them in a way that clarifies their meaning better than the extensive descriptions provided by others. I have also depicted the instrument differently from what was previously shown and explained.
I say that a hunchback that occurs in the chest from the front cannot be treated, and it will not heal. The same applies to those occurring on the sides. Only those that occur in the back can be treated as I shall describe, which is to lay the patient face down.
On a level workbench near a wall, spread a moist towel underneath it so as not to hurt his chest. Then place a vertical plank embedded in a hole in the ground at one end of the bench towards his head and another towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the plank, and let it not be securely fixed in the hole; another servant holds the other plank in that manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft but snug cloth bandage, and extend one end of the bandage to the plank at his head and secure it there.
Then secure with another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his toes. Then gather all the ties together and fasten them to the other plank at his feet. Then each servant pulls on the plank in his direction by the tie so that the planks do not move from their fixed positions.
However, they are not securely fixed as we said. The physician places his hands firmly on the knot so that it returns or places a board over it; then he leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board that is about three cubits long.
And dig into the wall near the patient a place where one end of the board can be inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end of the board and pulls it tightly until the knot is compressed.
And it returns to its place. If you wish to make it with a lever that is twisted by hand, then fix two planks in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the bench, each about an arm's length long, and similarly two more at his feet at the other end of the bench.
And let there be one cubit between each board, and make a hole in each board through which the spindle passes. Secure all the boards firmly in the ground so that they do not move at all, and insert a round stick, which is the spindle around which the ligature is twisted in the holes of the two boards.
At one end, there is a hole in which a stick of one cubit length is secured for twisting. The same is done in the other two boards. Then, the ligature that was tied around the patient's chest is attached to the spindle at his head, and the ligatures that were tied around his legs are attached to the spindle at his feet.
Then, a servant stands by each spindle and twists it with his hand using the twisting tool, while the doctor adjusts the swelling as previously described. This is an image of the spindles, the frame, and the patient:.
Then, after the vertebra returns to its place and the area is leveled, it is necessary to apply a plaster bandage dried with egg white, followed by a pad. Then place a splint made of wood above the bandage, which should have a width of about three fingers, and its length should be approximately where the swelling was.
And then place some correct stitches and bind with the appropriate ligature. The patient should use gentle food until he recovers. If there are any lumps remaining in the area at the end of the healing process, it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with using the described splint for a long period.
A lead plate may be used for this purpose. Sometimes, a lump appears at the end of the stitches on the spine, and it is assumed to be dislocation; however, it may be an excess bone that has grown, so do not treat it with this method, as it could cause death.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are subject to dislocation only, and they do not suffer from the slight displacement or narrowing that other joints may experience. The hip joint can become dislocated in four ways.
It can dislocate inward, outward, forward, and backward. Dislocation inward is the most common, while dislocation forward or backward is less frequent. A sign of inward dislocation is that when you compare the lengths of the healthy leg and the affected leg with the feet together, the affected leg appears longer.
The knee on the affected side will protrude more than the healthy one, and the patient will not be able to bend the leg at the groin. The area near the groin will appear swollen and clearly distended because the head of the femur has moved there.
A sign of dislocation outward is that the symptoms are opposite to those described. A sign of dislocation forward is that the patient can fully extend the leg without pain, but if they attempt to walk or bend the knee, they cannot do so forward without discomfort.
The patient will experience difficulty in urination, and their groin will be tense. When walking, they will walk on their heel. A sign of dislocation backward is that the knee cannot be straightened or bent without first bending the hip, and the leg will also appear shorter than the other.
The groin will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be clearly visible in the position of the waist. As for treating these types of dislocations, if the dislocation is old and has caused prolonged suffering without any attempt to reduce it, there is no cure.
It should not be exposed, and as for the one that was recently dislocated, whether it is of any type from the four aspects of the jaw, you should immediately twist the joint and stretch it inward and outward and move it right and left, for perhaps [it may help].
He returns without needing any other treatment. If he does not return like this, it is necessary to prepare a strong servant who can extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a sling tied above the knee, and another servant to support him from above.
By inserting his hands under his armpits, then securing a soft sling at the root of the thigh, and another servant holding the end of the sling, he is pulled either from the front, from the groin area to the neck area, or from behind, to the back area.
They all pull at once until the patient is lifted off the ground and remains suspended. This type of pulling is common to the four types. If the jaw returns as we have said, otherwise, each type requires a specific treatment that I will mention.
As for its specific treatment if the jaw is dislocated inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then a sling should be placed at the root of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area below the groin.
Then extend the sling from the side of the groin upwards to the top of the body towards the neck, then another strong servant takes hold with his arms and embraces the thick part of the patient's thigh and pulls outward very strongly; it will return to its place.
This type is easier than all other types of treatment used to restore this organ. If it proves impossible for you and the patient absolutely refuses this type of treatment, then you should bind both legs of the patient with a strong but flexible bandage at the heels and knees.
Each should be spaced four finger breadths apart, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by two finger breadths. Then, suspend the patient from the head using a beam in the house, with the distance from the ground being about two forearm lengths.
Then, order a strong servant to embrace the head of the thigh, and another servant should hold the patient. The other servant should push firmly, causing the joint to quickly return to its place. As for its specific reduction when the jaw is dislocated outward.
The patient should lie down on the bed as described for one with kyphosis. The bandage should be tightened around his affected leg and across his chest. Then, place two beams, one at his feet and the other at his head. Additionally, place an extra beam in the middle of the bed secured very tightly.
A wet cloth should be wrapped around it to prevent it from harming the patient, and the beam should be placed between his thighs to prevent him from dropping downward when stretched. Then, each servant pulls in their respective directions, while the doctor adjusts the hip with both hands; if it responds and returns.
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it as described for kyphosis, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. If the dislocation is forward, then extend the patient's leg once while he is in this description on the bed.
The doctor places his right hand on the diseased joint, then presses it with the other hand, and stretches the pressure downward toward the knee. If the dislocation is backward, it should not be extended downward.
It should be raised from the ground and should be placed on a solid surface, as it should also extend from his nose to his hip outward, according to how he lies on the operating table, with his face up and restraints tightened.
As we said before, the pressure with the board should also be used on the place to which the joint has dislocated. When the hip joint returns as it should, and its return is not hidden from you, which is evident when you can straighten the patient's leg.
When you see them level and the patient can draw back and extend the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should. At this point, join the thighs together and apply bandages tightly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then loosen the restraints and bandages and measure the leg against the other. If they are equal in length, then know that the joint has stabilized; release the patient to walk. If you notice any slackness in it.
Return, dress the wound, and bind it as you did initially. Leave it for three more days, then loosen it and allow him to walk on it gradually for several days until it strengthens, so he may walk normally, God willing.

On the Treatment of Dislocated Kneecap.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward, which means to the rear; it does not dislocate forward at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to draw up his leg toward his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce all forms of its dislocation, seat the patient sitting with his legs extended if he can manage this; have a servant sit behind him to hold his waist and slightly turn it backward; then sit on his thighs.
Lean your back against his face and place his leg between yours; then grasp his knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers around it; press the sides of his knee firmly with your hands; another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its proper position.
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres gently to the thigh without being forced; then dress it and bind the leg to the thigh with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. He should not use it except for little walking for several days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it as described, then use strong traction with the bandages that I have previously described for treating the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Heel.
The heel may become slightly loose, or it may come completely detached; its detachment may be either inward or outward. The sign of its detachment is that you will see the heel swollen and protruding in the direction to which it has separated.
As for the treatment of its slight loosening, it is easy to return it by gently stretching with your hands until it returns to its place. As for its complete detachment, it should be that the patient sits down and a strong servant holds him firmly from behind at his waist.
Then, with your right hand, grasp his foot from the top and with your left hand from below at the ankle. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand twice, then stretch it with your left hand while gently pushing the front of the foot toward the leg with your right hand without using force.
Do this twice as described, then in the third time push the front of the foot toward the leg while pulling at the ankle. If it returns in one or two attempts in this manner and you see that the foot is level, otherwise repeat the procedure on it, for it will return.
If it refuses to return as described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and secure a lever firmly in the ground between his thighs, wrapping it with cloth so as not to injure the patient. Then a servant should hold his thigh steady.
Then another servant extends the leg either with his hands or by using a rope tied around the ankle. Both servants then pull in opposite directions while the lever remains between the patient's thighs to prevent his body from being pulled downward during the extension. The physician then aligns the detachment with his hands.
Another servant holds the healthy leg below, for the bone will quickly return to its place. When it returns and you see that it has returned correctly, apply the bandage and secure it tightly with straps, and bind the foot firmly below with a strap. Be careful of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.
So that the binding is not too tight and does not hurt him. Then leave it for two or three days; if the binding loosens, retighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient must abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, there is no guarantee that the bone will not dislocate and become irreparable, as treatment may not be effective afterward. If inflammation occurs, you should use what has been previously described in other parts of the text for treatment and poultices until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the Treatment of Finger Fractures of the Leg.
It is necessary to realign what has become dislocated with a gentle pull without violence, which is not difficult but rather easy. If the bone is in one of the segments at the back of the foot, the patient should place their foot on an even surface of the ground.
Or place the foot on a board while the patient is standing as if walking, then step on it with your foot firmly until it returns to its proper position and you see that it is aligned without any lumps appearing in the area.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot that covers the entire foot and has two supports, then secure it tightly for three days. Then release it but keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are assured there is no return to dislocation, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
Concerning the types of suturing for wounds or fractures or both.
When any of these occur and one attempts to treat and set them, they often lead to death.
Therefore, one should not attempt to treat such cases unless they are skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, cautious, and neither reckless nor overconfident. Initially, they should use only medicines that relieve hot swellings and leave the patient at ease.
To the extent, O Lord, except what one hopes to recover from damage with a light illness and where some hope is apparent; then immediately at the outset, before the hot swelling occurs, attempt to treat it.
If the part returns to what was intended, then use methods to relieve hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments. If the suturing is accompanied by a fracture and fragments of bone become dislodged, then attempt to remove them. Follow in this regard what we have mentioned regarding simple diseases as discussed earlier in their respective places.
Strive to your best effort and purify yourself from entering the path of risk, as I have advised you earlier. This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your dignity, if God wills.
