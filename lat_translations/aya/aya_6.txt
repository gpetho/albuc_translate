Praefatio.	Preamble.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed to you, son, this book, which is the last of science in medicine with its supplement, and I have finished in it from its expositions and declarations, it has seemed to me that I complete it to you with this Treaty, which is part of surgery, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation by hand is laid out in our region and in our time exclusively: until perhaps science of it has perished, and its trail has been lost: and there remained from it, except for a few descriptions in ancient books, which hands have altered: and it happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed and its will was drawn out: It seemed to me that I could make it clear with the order of this Treaty in it second according to exposition and declaration and abbreviation: and I could bring it into being with forms of instruments cautery and the remaining tools of the work: since it is fitting from its addition and from its propering that what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Because because for which there is not a good craftsman of his hand with it in our time: because the art of medicine is long, and the author of it needs to be exercised before it in the science of anatomy which he told Galen, until he knows the joints of limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has understanding of bones, and nerves, and snakes, and number of them, and their emission, and throbbing pulses, and quiet, and places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And therefore said Hippocrates, whose name is much, and work is little, and especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already said about that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since who does not know that we have said about anatomy, does not expunge, except he falls into error, which people bring about: as I saw many of them, who form themselves from this science, and throw themselves into it without knowledge, and without experimentation.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Which is because I saw a doctor with a dull instrument incise an aposteme of the scrofulous in the woman's neck, and cut some arteries in her neck; why the blood of the woman flowed until she fell dead between her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who thought that he would extract a large stone from the woman's bowels, which had lain for a long time; and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he approached it, and extracted it with the help of a hook.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I was called upon to extract it too; and I saw from the great size of the stone and the care of the nurse that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who took a staff from our king for medicine; and there happened to be a black eunuch by him, who was wounded in his thigh near the heel; and the doctor tightened the wound with sharp pins, and bound it strongly with strong bandages, and did not cease from his foolishness, and he tightened the wound around the bone with strong sutures, and did not leave off wounding.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he finished him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Later on he left him for a few days and commanded that the bandages be not loosened; and so he remained until his leg was withered away, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called upon to loosen the bandages; and so it was accomplished that he had peace, and was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However the corruption had now become confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased to walk around in the member until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced an ulcerous pustule; and it was ulcerated for a few days until the malignancy of it spread to his lord with a plague.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is because when the cancer is pure from the melancholy humor, then one should not approach it at all with iron unless it be in a member that can bear it, so that it may be cut off entirely from it.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, my sons, you need to know that surgery is divided into two sections: namely, the operation which is associated with health; and the operation, where there is danger in many arrangements.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already excited in every place of this book, where came the operation, where there is fear and terror.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why you need to be careful of that, and to decrease it: so that they do not find a stupid person to speak and dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, you accept a measure with care and protection, and bring the sick among you with ease and strength, and use a better way, leading to the grace of God for salvation and worthy succession: and remove the fearful sickness from you that makes you afraid, so that it may come on you a hesitation in our faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains more for the glory of our faith, and more excellent in the world, and finally for the quantities of you.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galenus has already said in some of his advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat disease with medicine: do not name yourself a doctor of ill.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this treatise into two chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter one.
Capitulum secundum.	Second chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter two.
Capitulum tertium.	Third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Chapter three.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Chapter one.
Caput I.	Chapter one.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I remember the operation with it, it is necessary that I should say the quality of its tools and the injury to itself, and where it displays it.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the speech on the quality of cauterization and its harm is long and subtle, knowledge and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also spoken in it by many wise men, and they differ in their opinions; and to me a little of their words is enough, fearing lengthening.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that cauterization is universal to all constitution, which is with matter and without matter; excepting two constitutions, which are hot and dry without matter, and dry and cold without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in the constitution hot and dry with matter they differ.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some therefore say that cauterization is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	But others have said the opposite of it, namely that cauterization is not appropriate in a sickness which is of heat and dryness; for fire's nature is hot: and it is inappropriate, as it heals the sickness of hot and dry, with hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of it said: That by means of cauterization is a healing in all sickness of heat and dryness which happens in human bodies; for when you compare the human body, and its humours, to the constitution of fire, the human body becomes wet.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I too say by means of his speech; for from experimentation I have found that it is sometimes.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	But it is not necessary that you go into detail about that, unless who has already been tested, and exercised in the exercise of the last chapter of cauterization, and knows the diversity of human constitutions, and the disposition of sicknesses in them, and their causes, and accidents, and the space of time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Of the rest of the constitutions there is no fear for you; and above all in sicknesses of cold and wet.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all doctors have already met on them; and they do not differ in the healing with cauterization.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know you sons, that the cure of secret diseases by means of fire, and its goodness, is superimposed on the fire with medicine burning: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the limb which is cauterized; and it does not hurt another member connected with it, unless there is a small injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of medicine burning is extended to that which lengthens out of limbs: and perhaps it causes to happen to a limb illness difficult to heal, and perhaps it destroys life.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But because of the subtlety and goodness of its substance, fire does not do this, unless it flows over.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now that has become clear to us by experience, because of the length of use and study with art, and its position on verity of things: and also excused from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not permitted to my book, I would bring you the secret and mystery of fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by its expulsion, which expulses diseases with philosophical demonstration, which was acquired from the minds of your own,
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know you sons, that they differ at times when it is to be done, and put forward the time of medicine.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that the fire is to be made at all times: for, because the accident happens through time, it is buried in ease, which is drawn with the fire.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And above all if the fire is for pains of necessity, strong, feasts which do not suffer delay: because they are afraid of these, that evil might happen, which is greater than little injury, when there is no transgression through time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not say to your sons that they do not understand, unless the general and dull doctors: namely, that their sicknesses which are healed by the fire are not always: and they put forward this consequence, and it is not like what they say: because the fire is not, except in place of medicine, which alters color, and dries out moisture, which are causes of diseases, so that accidents happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Indeed, the use of cautery is superfluous above medicine due to its velocity, excellence, and power, and it may be that the disease will depart at some time after the application of the nurse, and the removal of the disease, and its power: and because it is prepared in his body from an excess of collection within him: and because it arrives at him in the acquisition of its own from food, and similar things from causes, unless the disease, in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Indeed, a slight disease in some member is superfluous due to the excess of heat and moisture, such as a toothache, because of pain, and similar things: for it is possible that this pain will not depart from him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is right in a few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the speech of the healing is again, which cautery is last medicine, it is right speech: not to that which they intend in him: for they believe that is no cure that confers with medicine, nor with any other after the occasion of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is opposite to his speech, and the intent, that cautery is last medicine, it is not, unless when we administer ways of cure in some diseases, and they do not confer such medicines: then we administer at the end of this matter cautery, and it confers: then from here it falls, that cautery is last medicine, not according to the intent which the common people and many solid doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancients said, that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say this, unless for the equality of gold, and its limitation in substance: and they said, that it does not make place for cauter
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not absolutely true: for I have already tested this, and I found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	Indeed, when you heat the cautery of gold in fire, it is not revealed to you when heated according to the quantity that you want, because of the redness of gold: and when it is suitable for itself to cool down, and if you add ignition on it, it melts in the fire, and turns into leaves.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the artisan fall from that in work: and for that reason is the cautery with iron with us quicker and closer, from the right to the work.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I too have already arranged this chapter on the cautery, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from the head to the feet: so that they may please him who seeks it out from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	De mode cauterizandi caput in commissura coronali
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Confirm here cauterization to the lord of humidity and coldness on the head: which two are causes of salt, and multitude of flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and universally all sicknesses that happen because of coldness, such as paralysis, and salting, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar to them of illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The mode of cauterization is that you command the sick person: so that he is discharged in the first place with a solutiory medicinal solution cleansing the head three times, or four, according to what requires the strength of the sick, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him that he should shine on his head with a soft-flecked cloth.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already put his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	And whatever way your middle finger passes, mark that spot with a brand.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then set fire to the cautery of oil: which has this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then put the piece on the marked place with the forceps, pull down slowly, and you will turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly open your hand, and see the site.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	That if you see now a quantity of hair from the skull has been detected or a quantity of sage, then quickly open your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron or if it is cold with another: until you see the bones that I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and dip the cloth in it, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put over the cloth dipped in butter and leave it on the place until the fire is extinguished.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the ointment of the four-fold remedy until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have said, that as long as a wound remains open, it will discharge pus: why is it better and more beneficial to leave it uncovered.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cauterization should be held until a certain hardness of bone is reached.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it should be rubbed after that which is burnt from the bone, then it should be cauterized.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it should be made to reach the last by cauterization, until it leaves an impression on the bone like a letter: or with an instrument that women put in a small vessel of water: and they calculate that vapours from this place are exhaled after a long time, and the wound remains open for a long period.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then cauterize it until it hardens.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But I do not see these two kinds of cauterization being used by any humans at all unless it is out of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	Then leave it alone, for me it is better with the health of that one.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the solution of its own natural continuance; as we have witnessed in other members, and especially when the head is weak and nature infirm: and the species of Cautery, first, is more salutary and better with me, which I use; therefore let us operate upon it when it is sound.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	The way to cauterize the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter III: On the Treatment of Head Pain.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in an infirm person, and he uses hyde, poultices, head-baths, oils, and applications: let us proceed to cauterization.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	Especially if it has been cauterized once before with the one kind of cautery which we have described, and does not benefit from it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is infirm of nature, and not weak, and there is a cold sensation: then cauterize with another kind of cautery under it little by little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize the head itself over all its horns with his own cautery, and let not the skin be damaged, and let some quantity be scraped from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize the head itself with one kind of cautery in the nape of the neck, in the place which is called the "was"; and that is the place where a breeze blows: and wet your hand in this, and do not scrape the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the infirmity is caused by the intense pain, and is far removed from the pain of the other parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this cautery by its own name; and it is necessary that there be a kind of cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and that a smaller kind of cautery is used to cauterize the middle part of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Chapter V: On the Treatment of Hemorrhage, whether with medicine adjusted or with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV: On the Treatment of Headache.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and soda occur in part of the head, or extends to the eye, and is rinsed with medicated water, and the rest of the treatment administered, as I said in the division of diseases, and does not bring it all: then cauterization is according to two ways: either cauterization with sharp medicine burning: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But cautery with sharp medicine burning, is, that you take one tooth of another, and bark it up, and cut off the ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the area of pain at the time with a phlebotome on one side, until a spot under the skin is made where the pain is taken.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into himself under the skin, until it is hidden: then tie it over itself with a cloth constricting it, and leave it for fifteen hours, and then dissolve it, and remove another, and leave it for two days, or three: then put on top of it an oiled cloth, until the spot makes pus: then heal the pus with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make this with some sharp medicines that I wrote about in the twelfth chapter of the book "On the Burning of Medicines".
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cautery with iron, is according to this way:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Place on the fire
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Clauis: for the shape of the head is like the shape of a clauis, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is some small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place the clauis on the spot, and keep your hand: and turn the iron slowly with speed: and let the quantity that burns be of the thickness of the skin, like a half.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And move your hand so that the artery, which is below, does not burn, and an outflow of blood does not occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the cloth in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then dip the cloth in butter: then heal with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you see this half-headache with extreme cutting, second cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And because of the incision of the artery in this half-headache, not old in itself.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The method of cauterizing in an old half-headache.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are healing a half-headache, with this that we have said before from the treatment preceding, and because we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the cure is not sufficient: and you see from illness that it does not suffice to him that we have said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, then it should be that you cause the fires of cauterium to cut, until white comes out after the signs on the spot of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and you put your hand by force, and squeeze it until you cut the artery, and reach as far as the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you need to cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which moves when it chews, so that it does not burn on the side, or the nerve that moves it, from which comes a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this should be over the guard, and caution about the flow of blood of the artery that has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is a fear in cutting it, and above all to him who does not know that which he does, and is not learned, nor expert: and dismisses the operation with him at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the regulation of the flow of blood of the accident from the artery according to its way, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from illness that this Cautery does not suffice for him, and you see the body accepting the cauterium in the middle of the head, as we have told, heal a wound, until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see this, administer the cauterium that we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a holding cauterium and two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	Cauterization is better and more effective in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	The method for cauterizing ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI. On the Treatment of Head Injuries.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear due to cold, and it is treated with solvents, and the subsequent treatment as we have explained in the division, and if the pain does not go away, then cauterize with fire: and this is what is called a dot, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the dots with what remains after the fire has gone around the whole ear, as it heals: or around each one, if pain is simultaneous on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen it slightly with the cauterizer from the root of the ear after you have marked the places with caustic: and let the amount of cautery be ten dots throughout the whole ear, and almost the same.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	The method for cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII. On the Treatment of Torment and Wounds
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture treatment with cauterization is only from the causes that occur due to phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And distant cauterization of the type that occurs due to drying, and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torture with hyoscyamus, and caput purgatis, and gargarisms, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then you should cauterize the sick person with three cauterizations: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly below its opening, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak spot.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur unless the visible part appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of the cauterization is so that it cauterizes itself directly at the extreme end of the upper ear above the ear lobe, a little below: and another at the time: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	Set your hand down with the cautery, until half the thickness of the skin is burned away.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the shape of the cautery; and the kind of the knife whose form is given above: indeed it is not so fine as a little, as you see; and let the knife be a little too thick in it.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then cure the place with this which went before: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	The mode of cauterizing in ancient apoplexia.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When a stroke of ancient apoplexia is incurred, and the cure is given with that which we have said, and your medicine does not take effect, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on all the corners of his head, and a cautery in the middle of his head, as we have said, and a cautery in the back of his head, according to what went before: and let the mode of the cautery be according to what went before.

Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the kind of cautery: and let it be according to that order which we said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then he heals by means of it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then give him three cauteries in the back of his head, which go down from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and let there be a thickeness of the finger between every cautery.

Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you see a wound that needs to be added, and he who accepts it is weak: then do cauterization for him in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	That if you add to the wound: then cauterize it on top of two horns.

Then wipe the head with milk: then cauterize it with cauterium in the middle of the head, and with cauterium on top of each horn of the head, and with cauterium on the rear of him, and with three cauteriums on the spine of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are weak in the health of the body and many of them, and he who accepts it is weak, and the illness is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteriums on the spines of the back, and the last one with cauterium, until it is burned out from his skin, and wash your hand.

It is necessary that you purify his brain first with hyoscyamus, and with the rest of the cure that I have said in a division: when the sick one is great, or accepts medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a boy who does not tolerate medicines: then give him gargling and mouth rinses that purify the brain, before those many days of good nutrition.

Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.Et si uis, cauteriza Pal
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	If the eye is dry, there are two ways of cauterizing it: with fire: or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cauterium, however, with fire: require that it has already been washed before it, so that it lets go of its hair, if it is made up of them, until they have grown out and become smooth.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, it pierces him at the corner of his eye: then squeeze the eyes together with shut, so that they do not move, until they have healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When, therefore, they have healed and become smooth: then place the head in your lap: and then mark on each eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a sign that it is according to the figure of a leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place the poultice wetted with serum on albumen or on viscous mucus over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then heat the cautery, whose shape is this one.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure, which you indicated slowly on multiple spots, until the skin surface, which is like a fig leaf, burns up all by itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your operation is this: so that if you squeeze the eyelid of the eye and remove the hair near the eye's socket, it will not be injured.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So then, pray extend your hand: and after three days send for him.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over the wound a poultice made with butter until the scab falls off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hair comes out after an hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterization on that spot, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hair is on the lower side: then cauterize it until it moves to its natural place: and adjust so that the eye hairs do not sting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	The way of cauterizing with burning medicine at the same time.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as you command to an injured person: that he does not shave his hair until it grows long and even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make in the shape of a fig leaf using a piece of paper or a cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take a well-known soap and some unblended lime from each of the two weights of a pound or almost as much: then rinse it all together with good rinsing at the same time, and make it with haste so that it does not grow cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from that take a bandage and place it over the shape you made like a fig leaf, and place the poultice on one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a poultice wetted with serum on albumen or: and let the head of the patient lie in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger over the medicine, and press slightly on it.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And thou shalt cut off his nose wheresoever he shall feel pain in his body through the medicine: for his mordica is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While the mordication he found himself was persisting, then abandon the medicine, and touch it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the mordication has stopped, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid rise up, as it were, when it is not contracted with fire, or with incision, is good: and if not, then repeat over the same place from the medicine, where it does not impress, and does not hurt, until your operation is complete, and the eye closes.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put on top of him Cotus with butter, until the skin which has become hard is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with the diaphoric ointment, or another one, until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you by the operation, to keep the last watch, so that nothing falls into the eye from the medicine.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	The mode of cauterizing in the tear duct.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you are treating the fistula, with what we have said regarding the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then you should cauterize it in this way:
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Prescribe to the sick person that he puts his head in your lap, and holds it between his hands so that it does not move or shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put on a poultice of milk of magnesia, or of slimy mucus from the head of a goat, over his eye; then apply cautery, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Then take a piece of twig like the feather of a crow from one end, so that it forms cautery; and if you want to go through with a knife to the other end, and if you want to stretch it like this.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this poultice is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then open the wound if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it up: and if it is not open, then open it, and remove the pus from it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then apply cautery to it, which burns well.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it with your hand near cautery from the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not move or shake: and put cautery into the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you therefore place cauterium at the beginning of your eye until it reaches the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then apply cautery once or twice, if you can stand it: and dismiss it after three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put on a poultice of butter, and treat the eye with an ointment to dry it up, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	That if after forty days it does not heal: then put on a sharp corrosive medicine over it until the tooth is revealed: and cut it out according to what comes next in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cautery with a twig, which some have first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Then go to the place of the wound, and find it: then put a small hole in it, that is, a small pipe, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of liquid lead, and hold the twig tightly in your hand, so that the patient does not move at all, so that it does not run away, or let the liquid lead reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	It is necessary that you put on the eye a poultice made with infusium in albumen, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvellous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, along with what we have said from the Canon and the Cure, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to open the nasal foramen, and reduce the fistula towards the course of the nose, according to how it comes in its own place.

When you are treating these cracks, according to what we have said regarding the separation of diseases, and there is no benefit from the cure, then a small fire of the kind described above should be used for cauterization.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let it be well-prepared according to the fineness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then quickly place the lit fire on the crack, until the burn reaches the depth of the cracks.

When it happens that a swelling occurs at the root of the gingival tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus is produced and breaks out: then it becomes hard and the pus flows and forms a fistula: then treat it, and there is no benefit from the cure, then let fire be used for cauterization according to the quantity that enters the fistula.

Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.Si sentit infirmus dentium dolor,
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the pain of the teeth is felt, When the pain of the teeth is caused by cold, or coldness itself, or itchiness, and does not answer to remedies: then there are two ways of cauterization: either with butter, or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But the cautery of his is with butter, that you may take buttyrum and melt it, and bring it to the injured part in an iron vessel, or in a tool.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and rub it well on the end of the tongue.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then dip the injured part into the melted butter: and put the part quickly on the tooth that pains, and hold it until it feels cold: then repeat the operation several times, until the power of the fire comes to the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you see, immerse the thread, or roll it in cold butter and place it on the tooth that hurts; and place iron that has been heated over it, until the fire reaches deep into the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But if cauterization with fire is intended, in order to address the canal of air or the channel of iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And sit in his body some grossness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sickly mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then hold the cauterizing instrument, of which shape is suitable: and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand, until the cauterization cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this sometimes, because the pain will be relieved, or on the same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it should be placed in impression of the cauterizing instrument, so that the sick mouth is filled with good butter, and hold for an hour: then open it widely.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cauterizing instrument.

When strophulus are on phlegm, and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and wish for quick digestion: then hold the cauterizing instrument, of which shape is as follows.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	It has two open extremities, so that smoke can emerge from the other end of the cauterizing instrument: and place the heated piece on the wound once, and again, if you tolerate it, until it reaches deep into the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	Which if the abscess is small: then place the cauterizing instrument according to the quantity of the abscess.

Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the dislocated head is caused by moisture, and does not return to its own place at the time of its dislocation until it has grown accustomed to returning, then it dislocates with a slight movement, as we have already mentioned, then you should reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then he shall lie down on his sick side or on his sound side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then you shall gently press with the thumb of your left hand, which is inside and above with the fingers, and if the dislocation occurs inside.

When cold and great moisture occur in the stomach, until they have taken the stomach out from under its skin, and multiply the discharge onto it, and persistently carry out the methods of curing it, and do not give: then let the sick person lie down on his back, and extend his legs, and stretch out his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery under the cochlea of the chest in the quantity of one digit with a cautery of the claw, and two cauteries below from the two sides of a cautery, until the shape of the cauterizations becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And extend between each other so that they do not join together when they make pustules.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauterizations be second to this form without addition: and if you want a large cautery for this cauterization in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let there be a cautery, with which this cauterization is made, one according to the figure of the circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And let the stomach be cauterized by piercing it with the finger that shudders at this cautery; and it is so, as to the sign, that you make on the stomach according to the quantity, which you want with the causticum: then cauterize the same with a piercing cautery: then cure the same with the cure, which preceded until it heals.

When it happens in the liver that there is pain from cold and moisture, or from a thick wind, until it emerges from its own natural exit by excess waste, and the sick person is treated with the method we have described, and does not benefit from it in him: then he should lie down on his back on a plaster on his back, and the signs be made with the causticum according to this form, and this quantity the same over Spar below from the hypocondriis, where the bed of man reaches; and let there be space between each other according to the thickness of the finger: and let the cautery be second to the length of the body straight: and do not compress your hand with a lot.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity that is burned from the thickness of the skin be half the quantity not added to it: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, for he has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the method of treatment.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And you too can do this type of treatment with a knife, when you have skill and caution in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And be careful not to proceed too far with the treatment, and that the skin does not become very dry all over the body, for it may cause the whole body to become dry, and reach the intestines: for the skin is there very thin, so you should know about that.

When it comes to treating a stab wound and you need to know, if this stab wound is in the liver or in its covering: then if it is in the liver, you will notice a dull pain, and there will be no sharpness of suffering; and if it is in the covering of the liver, there will be a sharp pain. And you will see that the treatment of these injuries tires out doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is therefore necessary that the sick person lie down on his own bed.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then shape the place of the wound with an encaustic, and then light the fire of the cautery to be absorbed by heat.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And treat with a single cautery, until the skin is completely burned over, and reaches the nipple, until it comes off entirely: then take care of the treatment of the wounds, until they heal.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary for this cautery to be used except by one who has prolonged study in the art of medicine; and through whose hands some of these illnesses have passed with experience at times: indeed, let such dare to operate on these cases.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But I think it is better to let it go.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	The method of treating pleural wounds.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The old people said that they used to treat pleurisy with a root of aristolocheia, cold and according to this method:
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you take from the roots of dry aristolochia long roots, a longer root that is found in it, and be as much as the thickness of the finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then dip it in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in him that is between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and two small cauteries under the guider little declining to the side, which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in him that is between the fifth and sixth ribs declining to the rear slightly: and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one in him that is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from the sides of the chest, lower cautery that is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you squeeze your hand with the cautery, but let it be in the open skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient men have said that from men who use a cautery of iron like a ray: and they light it up, and put it inside him that is between the ribs until it reaches with it to the apostema, and comes out pus: as we have said in the apostema of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cautery there is a fear that either the weak one immediately dies, or happens to a place of fistula, which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	§ On the way to cauterize the spleen Head XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you cure the sickness of the spleen, with him that we have said in the division of diseases, and your cure does not confer, then the cautery is in it according to three ways, which are all right.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is that you make three cauteries, or four in a line according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, whose precursor is the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And be between each cautery amount of thickness of the finger, or less slightly.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let there be a standard for cautery, which we have spoken of in the liver cautery equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cautery; and let the sick person lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of cauterization is that which has two flames, which we have spoken of in the chapter on shoulder dislocation; and wipe clean the skin, which is in the direct splenis, where the sick person lies on his left side: and let your elevation be as you wipe clean the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cautery falls according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two hot flames, until you have penetrated through the skin with them from one side; then remove the cautery: so there are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery that has three flames.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the cautery after you have removed it, if you wish, to emit pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than that which remains from the previous cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The mode of cauterizing in the Hydropsychosis.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in the Hydropsychosis unless it is properly elevated.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating the Hydropsychosis with the methods of cure which we have spoken of in the division, and there is no cure, then you should cauterize four times around the navel, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the spine, and one directly in the chest, and another directly in the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the cautery open, so that it emits pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not wipe out the sick person from the cure after the cautery with him: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined with him; and he will quickly recover with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the wound from which the incision is made should be closed; according to what preceded in its shape; and when it is on the back, it should be closed with oil according to what preceded in its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	关于脚和腿的切口方式。
Caput XXXIIII.	标题：第34章
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	如果在水治疗后出现黄水，必须在脚背上进行切口，这位于耳朵和无名指之间；用油 cauterize它，不要扭动它：然后，用油治疗手，不要再次治疗。
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	如果黄水恢复，那么就根据这种形状进行切口。
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	然后，在腿的两侧各做一个切口，并根据刀片的形状进行 cauterization；在腿上沿着刀片的长度各做一个 cauterization，一个在膝盖上方，另一个在腿底部，大约在腿的中间：在臀部前后各做一个切口；不要长时间等待，否则就会从中流出水，然后照顾伤口，其余部分如上所述。
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	关于在腹腔溶液中 cauterization的做法：
Caput XXXV.	标题：第35章
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	如果腹腔有冷和潮湿，直到肌肉的力量和消化能力减弱，它们位于胃和小肠中：给它治疗的做法，如果没有好转，则知道它不会痊愈；你会看到一个充满活力的病因，然后用大刀在胃上进行 cauterization，根据胃部 cauterization的前提来做；在 주변有四个细 cauterization的 navel，有一个小的 cauterization，根据前面的前提来做：以及大刀或两个刀 在下巴上方。
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	如果你看到充盈的湿气，以及一个容忍疾病的身体，那么在胸部和整个骨干上进行 cauterization；也许在胃旁边增加两个小的 cauterization。
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For the cure is perfect in a surgeon whose skill is not at fault.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	The mode of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When the hemorrhoids are old and many, or one, and they are of gross humors, cold, or corrupt moistures, and they are treated with what we have said in the division, and there is no cure: then cauterize three cauterizations on the lower spinal cord of the back under an almizcle somewhat triangular, and a cauterization under the navel almost like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face turning pale, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has gone before: and a cautery on his spleen, and another on his liver, with a clove of garlic: and let the cautery remain open for some time: then take care of him himself until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	The mode of cauterizing athel to which the cut has been made.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you are cutting off the athel, then set fire to the cautery that is being absorbed by a beam of light.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then put the fire itself on to the athel which has been cut off: and last use your hand, until the cautery reaches the orifice of the anus, from which blood runs: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then there are many athelums, then cauterize each one with a separate cautery according to what we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them, applying the unguent to them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the upper part of his back, it is more final in its effect.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The mode of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not submit to the cutting and operation which we have described in its place, and shudders at it, perhaps he will be cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When then a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes old, pus runs out of it, and corrupt humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	For this is worthy that you should probe it with care when you attempt it with the blade.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of it by attempting it.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then light a caustic fire, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself with the lit fire into the fistula and measure the amount in which it enters.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the caustic, until all the corrupt bodies are burned up, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need of your case.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself against any burning of the flesh, if there is any such thing there, or great sores: or if the fistula opens into the body of the uterus, or into the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not attempt it, unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and be aware, that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and matter is severed from it, and remains so for a long time: then know that he has already been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if matter is not severed from it, then know that it is penetrat-ing, or that there is a corrupt hole in its depth, or something like it: of which the memory will remain in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	As for the method of applying the caustic to Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain happens to Renes from cold, or from gross wind, and it is noon-time because of the care of the sick, then you should apply the caustic to the very top of the kidneys, with the caustic on all the kidneys with the caustic-knife, whose predecessor was the memory.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should apply the caustic to it a second time in the middle of the kidney.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three lines drawn?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Thus they will be more final in the incision.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	The way to cauterize the vesica.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40: On the Head.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there occurs in the vesica weakness and softening from cold and moisture, until it does not retain the urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the suprasinus above the vesica, where the hair begins to grow on a comb, and cauterize with fire from the right side, and with another from the left: and let the length of that cautery be according to the length of the knuckle of the hand: and cauterize it from behind the lower spine, or two cauteries, if you can bear it: and let it be according to what came before cautery with a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The way to cauterize the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41: On the Head.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When there occurs in the womb cold and moisture, and it is prevented from impregnation by it, and her menstrual courses are disrupted, and her symptoms are delayed and she experiences pain at the time of intercourse, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the vesica, and cautery on the lower back, or two cauteries: and let it be according to what came before cautery with a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The way to cauterize the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42: On the Head.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the moist mucus of the anus flows out to the faeces, and there is a cause for its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that it prolongs the skin over one side, when they are facing each other: and the site of dislocation is found in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it should be that the sick one is cauterized over the anus of himself with a similar circle of fire: after you have marked with the causticum around the anus, as it recedes: and let it fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the shape of that which came before be in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If you do not have this cautery with you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, each with a large olive oil cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin everywhere.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	§ The way to cauterize the sciatic nerve.
Caput XLIII.	HEAD LIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the leg, and there is cause for it, cold and moisture: then treat the sick with what we have said in division, and if there is no benefit from that treatment, and it becomes stagnant: then one should remove the sick person from thick humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and others.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of the cautery in it is according to two ways: either with a cautery that burns with medicine, or with a cautery and fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	A cautery with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is that you cauterize on top of the sciatic nerve with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be space between each cautery according to the thickness of the finger: and let there be olive oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the cautery is made in the middle on top of the sciatic nerve itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded the dislocation of the sciatic nerve, one: so that the circle encompasses all the sciatica.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn away the thickness of the skin everywhere.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the way to cauterize the sciatic nerve, when pain adheres to the sciatic nerve itself, and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on top of the hip, on the spot where the pain is, and your own cautery on the palm of the hand slightly on the side: and let there be a knife-like cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the incision be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	Which if the sick one is hurting that the pain extends up to almost the toes, then cauterize himself there where he is hurting with the cautery of a point, three, or four, or many, if he desires that.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he is hurting the pain being under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize himself there with a one-bladed knife.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And let it be for you in all your cauterizations so that you do not finish with the cautery to this way that you burn nerves, or a large artery, and drag yourself through it on ill-will against bad injury, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have now seen one and another who cauterized above the knee, and finished in the cauterization, and the leg was swollen, until the tumor had followed the foot, and had been perforate throughout, and corrupt throughout: then happened a solution of the blood, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	Which if the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this way.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise ones have said in the cauterization of the ankle, whose cauterization is this way.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar shape of the iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at the opening according to the thickness of the finger nail, or less more: and within that third sat the fourth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space which is between each samium according to the quantity of the knuckle of the hand: and let there be open samia on two parts: and let their height almost be a knot, or two knots: and make them handles from iron, out of place in the samiis.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire, until it turns red, and lets off sparks: then let it be placed on a plate of the ankle lying on a sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauteries in a line.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then dismiss him after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then bind it with plaster and resin: and dismiss the broken bone after many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment, until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucitas, with this kind of surgery on the son, we use a little because of the fear of his appearance: and therefore, because there are few who wait for him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, from good surgery he who endures it, and he remains with him in his place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cautery when you are operating, so that you make two loops of thread through which the cardia of his arm or leg extends from metal or iron, long enough to reach the height of its wall: of which there are two knots, or almost the same as itself.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there is a space which is between each amount of thickness of the finger, and they are open at the bottom and above: and let it be that they contain themselves in reverse order, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a bed of ash, lying ill on his healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand hard on the bed of ash.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is slightly heated with fire, and hold it for a time: and let the ill person feel the bite of it, and his burn, because he finds the bite like fire, until he is calmed down by it.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with an instrument and rinse it thoroughly with sweet water: then dismiss him after three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place on it butter, until the burn comes off its blackness: and dismiss it after a few days, and let the pus run out of it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the latest in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or wound: let him have a platform in it which holds water, according to what you did with the ash.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method for hot water: and I have already written about it in my treatise on the correction of diseases.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and not extinct limestone of both parts one: blend them together, and put them in a new jug whose lower part has a small hole punched into it, according to the quantity that is added to it itself: and put under the bottom of the jug another jug full: and pour water from the sweet well over the alkali and limestone, which submerges both by one finger: then squeeze them with your hand firmly: and remove the jug, until the sharp water comes out on the lower part of the jug.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water, and pour it over another limestone: and squeeze again until it renews.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For this will then be very strong and acute, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it will effect the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines there are, with which they cauterize the wide, also like theriaca, and honey of almond, and lime mixed with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galenus himself reported, telling of a man from the ancient cure, who was cured of pain in his ankle and sciatica: and he made known that it was very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, I did not like any other cure, and I was healed from one leg, until he reported, that perhaps he had entered a hot bath, and came out already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, to be taken from the seed of a man: and if a seed is not found in him, let it be taken like this, fresh: and let it be massaged much with some fat, and let it be put on the ankle where the pain is, or in the hip, or in the thigh: and let it be bound up, and left for a certain number of hours, or for the quantity that he feels the sick person's sedative discomfort.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the body therefore becomes damp, then introduce it into the mud.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has subsided, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not necessary to apply any medication to these medicines unless after evакуation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that when it is cauterized with goat dung, if it has sciatic pain, it will heal: and it becomes a cautery in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	A wool is soaked in old oil, and is placed on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the nail, and is closer to the nail.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take goat dung as it is, and set fire to it in the fire, until it becomes a coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place the coal on the wool, and leave it, until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	So do not stop doing that, until the sensation reaches the ankle by way of the mediation through to the heel, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this mode of cautery is called Vaccinian cauterization.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	In the cauterization of Dorsal pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	And when pain occurs in the Dorsal region from various causes, or from injury, or from excessive evakuation, and those similar ones, from a cold infusion of matter, and from moisture: and cauterization does not take place, unless in this one form alone, which is made by an infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evakuation of the wound with foetid pills, and those similar, so that they are placed on the Dorsal region where there is pain, three lines according to its length, after having marked the line with encaustro in each line, five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerant power of the wound: and it should be done cauterization with a cautery needle.

Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its onset in children is this: that it occurs to him a stricture in a sighing while being lifted up, and a movement: and an inguinal swelling in the last spine of the back and the knots of it, which has already begun to emerge over the remaining spines.

Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he takes the cauterization over all the spine equally: and if you want to cauterize around the spine with the cauterizer of two dots or three lines: and let the dots be near each other adjacently.

Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joint pain are caused by cold moisture that is spread to any member of the body, then when such pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to call it Podagra proper.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	So if the Podagra of cold cause is cured with curing methods, and the pains are not removed, then let the cauterization remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, so that he is cauterized after his evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauterizations: and let the cauterization be of Olitive.

Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we have said from the cautery in our book.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the fire, as the two lines turn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if there remains any pain in the fingers, then prick them, over every knuckle a prick, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.

Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then have him reduce himself with his fingers, and mark with the cautery under the rupture on the ridge of the spine, with the mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the top of the body.

When pain occurs in some member through injury or percussion, and that pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment with medicines; then it should be cauterized with the Pointed cautery knife.

Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat over the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because from the custom of these pains is that they change from one member to another as it approaches that which concerns it.

Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then leprosy is incurable, and you have treated it with the same cautery as we have said in the division, and it has not sunk down, and it does not stand still, but if there is corruption throughout its entire skin: then cauterize him on his head with five cautery knives: one in the middle of his hairline, and a second below that towards his forehead at the end of his eyebrows, and two above his ears, and one behind his ear.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly with the cautery your hand a little bit, until it prints in the mouth a pale impression, and dislocates from him the membranes: so that the expiration of the vapors gross from him is relieved, and the cautery also on the splen of himself, according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the Leprosy has already spread over the sick, and is manifest: then it is necessary that you should cauterize with these cauterizations which we said in the head, and cautery on the extreme end of the nose, and two cauterizes on two cheeks, and two cauterizes on the spine of the neck, and six on the spine of the back, and one great on the joints of the legs near the tails and one above him, with which he is bound: and two on the shoulders: namely, one on every shoulder, and two on the elbows, and two on the sides of the chest, and two on the tender parts of his breast: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands, and his feet: and cauterize him on every heel of his feet, and the knuckles of his hands.

Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that the sick do not feel pain in the cautery, as they feel it when they are healthy: for this reason, his body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizes are of a proper size and length according to the limbs and joints: because they preceded according to the appearance of the tools of surgery.

Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized with a circle around it as we have said: or with many cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	The way to cauterize the abductor muscle.
Caput LIII.	Chapter III On cauterization.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	If anyone has the abductor muscle and is delayed in maturing, or does it for the sake of doing it, or because of age, when it is old and there is little blood in it, or because of time, and the eye rushes to mature the abductor muscle, then cauterize around it with a few cauterizations by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will rush to mature on its own.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you want to make a hole in it with cautery, then take this kind of fire.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And lay it down in the middle of the abductor muscle until it enters the skin: and place the cautery from it so that it remains weak, so that the course of the blood is eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of the eye until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The way to cauterize with fire on a corrupt mass.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter IIII On cauterizing with fire on a corrupt mass.Si qu
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	If the corrosion is not but corruption in a walking member, and it corrupts that very member: as fire cooks dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see corrosion in a place that accepts the cautery with fire, then take many pieces of the cautery, small and large, and put them on according to what suits that place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize the mass from all parts until you eradicate the entire corrosion, and leave nothing of it within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of the mass for three days, and place sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschar is eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of the eye with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that after three days meat is born healthy, and there is no corruption, it is good.Deinde si corrodens non est sed autem incipiens esse, sicut cum se ignis comendit ligna umida: et si uides, quod ignorans tu captiam
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply a second cauterization to that which remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And when the ulcer has corroded, it is sometimes treated with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it itself rises again at the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, when the cauterization is with fire, it is faster to heal; and I have already said that I have said cauterization with acute medicine in division: so accept that there when you are ready.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	The mode of cauterizing in wounds and warts.
Caput LV.	Chap 51.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a gross disease, that affects the foot by filtration.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of cauterizing with fire, and cauterizing with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	But as much as it is with fire, so that the fire-scarification is like the feather of a scythe; which let it be made from iron, in quantity according to what it contains of the nail from all parts: and make the edge slight.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put on itself the burned thing over the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the nail, until it reaches the depth of the nail; and let it rest for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then bandage the wound with salve of wild silphium, crushed with salt: and let the plaster rest on the wound at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it itself will be根除根除。
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with a soft balm of meat, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not turned to dry, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then administer to them cauterization with hot water: and it is as you would take a tube from iron, or steel, or the feather of a scythe; and put it on the nail, or let it rest.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a little amount of hot water: hold the hand firmly, and rotate it slightly, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the nail root, and may find hot water to the depth of the nail: and wait for a while on the tingling of the water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let go of him, for the root is cut off with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do to them as one does to a single man, until you are satisfied with all that they have in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they are cut off, along with that which generates flesh from the ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	In tremor, the following method should be used for cauterization:
Caput LVI.	Head
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone that there is tremor from cold in a nerve, or from fever quartan, or from other causes: then it should be necessary for him to cauterize four times, or five on the spine at the back, and between every vertebrae one cautery, and in his own belly one cautery, and over his stomach one cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the oil cautery, and health of disease of cold speeds up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The following is the method of cauterization from the book of Albatar:
Caput LVII.	Head
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When there are in the body of the patient pustules that are formed from corrupt dry matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Then it should be necessary to cauterize first when they appear, with a fine wood cautery of myrrh, whose tip is heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or, when the root of aristea is long.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or, when the lente cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with the emetic, first by their own expulsions according to this mode: and they do not increase; and they stop the excess by doing so, and heal from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be necessary for that to be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	The following is the method of cauterization in the flow of blood from an artery in the ulnar:
Caput LVIII.	Head
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	This often happens with the flow of blood from an artery that is cut in the ulnar, which is external, or at the incision of a pimple, or when cauterizing a limb, and similar things to them: and it becomes difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When then it happens to any of you, then put your hand on the opening of the artery, and place your finger thereon: and squeeze it much, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing goes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put small olive oil wicks thereon, and many at a great deal: and blow upon them, until they are well lit.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or small, or great, according to the joint and place of the broken artery, and put the wick thereon, after which you remove your hand quickly: and hold the wick, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is driven out with your hand from the opening of the artery, and the wick is extinguished, then take another wick quickly from the wicks which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not cease to do this with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, so that you do not burn the wicks which are there, and an evil misfortune does not happen to another.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is impossible to stop it: above all when the artery is large, unless with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a wick, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends are drawn back, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or is bound with a strong knot of thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are placed on the top of medicine for its property, whose effect is to stop the blood, and is squeezed with a cotton reeve.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs the ligation of it with a ligature, and the constriction with a cloth, or the placing of burning things thereon, and similar things, does not give it a deep cut, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If then it happens to anyone of this, and there is no present doctor for him, nor medicine: then let the tip of the index finger begin to be placed on the opening of the wound himself as we have said, and squeeze it much, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and placed over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let the finger not be moved away, but above it with cold water of the cold always, until the blood is congealed, and swollen, and cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And in the meantime consider in him, what he needs from the poultice, or from the medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incision, perforation, and bleeding in wounds and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter about all disease where fire is used as a cautery and medicine, and its causes, its instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed there from the vertex to the heel.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter as well: so that the quester of the sought thing is eased.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O son, that the fear mentioned in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for this it is necessary that there be more caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, often drops of blood fall with it, and with those drops life is lost at the opening of the bowels, or incision on a blister, or opening of an exit, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and those similar things: from all of which tremor and fear are associated, and falls in many of them to death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you so that does not fall on you that hesitation, because sometimes they fall to you in this art of men with different kinds of sickness.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	From them indeed is one who becomes angry with his sickness, and is light-hearted towards him about death: because of the fear of it which he finds from his disease and length of evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when the sickness is from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	He who gives you his hand, and leads you, hoping for health, but his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary that you should agree to him who comes to you from among them, whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be on your guard with greater caution than with your greed and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presuppose anything about anyone from him, unless after knowing it certainly, which proves to you that his success is praiseworthy.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And practice the cure of all your sick, through prognosis and indication from him to where the health is appropriate.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him there is an aid for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration: for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have arranged this chapter distinguishing by chapters, according to which it precedes in the chapter of Cautery from the navel down to the feet: that you may be relieved in what you want from him, and in what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the Cure of Water which is added to the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this sickness often happens to boys at the time of birth: or when the midwife tightens the boy's head without lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I did not see this sickness in any other than in boys; and I wished to see all of them die, therefore for that reason I discontinued the operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I saw among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head became magnificent every day, until he could not sit on himself by himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it is collected between the skin and bone: or it is collected under the bone above the soft part.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the wound is small, then you should find a crack in the middle of the head in width: and the length of the crack is almost like two knots, until the moisture runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a spikelet.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	But if the moisture is increased and the wound is larger, then you should put two cracks, following this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the combs of the head open from all parts: and water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three cracks, following this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after cutting, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tightly close the cracks with rags and powder.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the ligaments, and take care of the tendon with bandages and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop tightening the head with equability.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry food of little moisture, until their member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another way to cut is to consider where the appearance of the wound is large, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Since when it is more in the back, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So rise up with the cut where it appears to you that there is a blister and a collecting of water: and tear it apart according to what you can do.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not cut the artery, and do not happen to the flow of blood, and the sick one dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incisions of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a catarrh occurs to the eyes or chest and becomes chronic and does not respond to medication, then the last resort is to make an incision in these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you are to incise these eyes, that the sick man should not have his head shaven.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then cover the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick man should tie his own neck with any kind of cloth.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are those which are behind the ears: and they seldom occur except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with encaustic on each: and cut both with a chisel sharp on both sides, incising towards the nose: and let it be made through the breadth of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish to cut the eye, introduce the chisel below the artery and make the incision upward.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be almost two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the eye is incised, blood flows outward with the pulse, which rises frequently to the inner parts.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you should measure from the ear the quantity of space of almost two fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with encaustic and find until the nose.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which should be emitted from the blood, is six minutes, and perhaps you emit more or less of it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this depends on the quantity which appears to you from the eye and the filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider towards the eye.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains at the nose from a sieve any residue, then cut it so that it does not occur an ulcer hot: and tighten the eye with a linen thread.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the eye with ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	As regards the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person has an old headache, or acute cataracts because of acrid humors and heat in the nostrils, or old soda, bitter and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and this does not help him: then we have become skilled in these illnesses by removing the arteries from the nostrils, or by cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is, that the sick person shaves the hair which is in the nostrils, and directs it toward the apparent artery in the nostril.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For this reason he shows himself to you from his pulse, and rarely hides unless in a few people, or when there is sudden coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it hides itself from you, then the sick person should tighten his head with any of his clothes: and then he should fear the place with a sharp cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he should warm the place with hot water until it appears to you in a manifest way.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a toothpick, which I have made slightly sharp.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw it in there with a hook, and draw it upward until you have drawn it out of the skin, and make it bleed from the shirts which are under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then turn it around with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part secondarily according to the length of its ends, and turn them inward, so that no blood flow occurs.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it does not cut, and if it does not separate, then the blood will not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then make the blood flow from six to a quarter of an ounce, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	For if the artery is large: then it should be tied to it in two places with double rope, strong and silk: or with animal sinew, so that it does not undergo decay before the wound is healed, and blood flow occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then incise the excess, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you want, cauterize it with a cautery until the mouth, with a surgical knife: until the ends of it are incised, and let it stand in place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this work is better if the person has a fever, or if his skin is hot.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery comes from those that remain to finish the moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to bind up.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, so that the place may be filled with old dry meat: and let they be placed on top of it feathers that have been made to drift.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution with dry medicines, which make the flesh grow, and with liniments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Which if meanwhile while you are working a flow of blood comes from an artery, then properly approach to cut it off with a cautery, or so that you fill up the place with gore: and clamp your hand tightly, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	Which if there is nothing from them for you at present, then put your finger on the place, until the blood has congealed.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And dip the place in water that gurgles with coldness, until the sharp pain subsides, and clamp it according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is, so that a cautery with two knives has been used: and the sharpness of the two knives is like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp in sharpness than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Which if they are sharp, like the two knives, it is better that both have coldness: and do not incise the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	So if there is some roughness in them, it is better that the heat of fire be held in them, and the flesh is cut off quickly: so that this work is better than any other, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space between the two razors which is of the size of the thickness of the finger; after you have marked the two places with the caustice: and put on both a long time, until they come to the mouth, and fall a little in both places: that what is between the extremities may be increased.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For with this caustic they do not solidify.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the caustic.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	De cure of the course of tears, sharp, acute, from the eyes:
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent, and there is a course for them from the top of the head; and she does not impart to them any benefit from medicine, but the eye becomes red, and feels a pulsing in its forehead, as if it were the pulsing of ants: then the eyelids become warm through the keenness of the tears: then the ancient ones had a habit of applying this cure with the Ense (a type of caustic), and called it treatment with the Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And is, as you command, for the sick to shave the hair on their forehead:
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut in the forehead three slits equal in distance from one another according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of the slit be almost that of two fingers, and let one slit be equal in length to the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to a slight increase in length next to the movement of the nostrils, and the third from the side of the other: and take care not to cut the arteries which are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let there be between each incision a space equal to that of three fingers joined together: and have ready for you a sponge fragment prepared, or many dry pieces of cloth, with which you shall squeeze out the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spit between the two sharp extremities, whose following form is:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temporal side, to the second incision: and scrub with it all the skin between the two incisions, with the caustic, which is on the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also cut from the middle up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then also remove this nail, and introduce into the first incision again a different tool called an acute chisel from one side, soft not acute from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its acute side against the flesh attached with skin, and its soft side against the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut off with it all the tools that descend from the head to the eyes: except that it continues the incision until that which appears out of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then also make this incision in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then also put into every fissure a black from old dough, and put on them wicks soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And check so that there does not occur an ecchymosis warm.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day resolve the ligaments, and administer a strong infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then also care for this with basilic ointment, and with the others which are treated with wounds: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ Of the cure of acute lacrimation and cataracts on the eyes from inside the head.
Caput V.	Head
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, bitter, and insistent cataracts occur in someone's eyes, and their eyes appear thin, pale, and already weakened in aspect: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out of them, and a sharp pain is felt in the depths of the head, causing sneezing: then remove these accidents, that those materials, and the cataracts do not come, unless they are removed with many tools.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, so that the sick person shaves his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in it one fissure in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly by width, and begin with the fissure from the left time to the right time: and let the incision go down to the bone: and stretch your hand away from the cheeks, which move at mastication: until when it is detected the bone: and you shall dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the fissure with boiled leather, or with linen liniments.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten from above with powder: and dip the powder in wine and oil, so that there does not occur a hot ecchymosis.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve it, and you see that the hot ecchymosis is about to appear: then it is necessary that you cut the bone, until there begins in it the growth of new flesh.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then the care of the patient with the drying treatment that makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony: and prepare from them an ointment, and apply it for the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Of the care that falls on gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls on gold is of four kinds: or is mineral rock, or similar rocks, such as iron and lead; or it is a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and like things; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore gold falls on a stone, or a kind of stone that does not add to it, and does not grow in gold, expose the gold to the sun: but if you see a stone, then distil into gold some of oil seasoned, or sesame seed.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and let it be snorted with condiments, and paint the nostrils at the approach of sneezing, when you put on around the ears twine made of linen, or wool, and extend the gold towards the upper part.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many times this care is needed.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not exit, then administer extraction with the Gestis, that is, the subtle Pizigari: whose shape is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If then it exits with the Gestis, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer extraction of it with a small, subtle, double-pointed hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If then it does not exit through that, then make a tube of brass, and insert the tip of the tube in the hole of the ear much, and the dregs which are in the circumferentia of the tube with the soft brass with oil, so that there is no way of wind except the tube: then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many times this care is needed.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not exit in this way: then take from the helkalimbat, or from the water, that is, the gluten prepared, with which they are tied, a little piece: and put it on the tip of the radius after you have turned it slightly out of place: then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear with moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If then it does not exit with all that we have described, then approach to cut off, before a hot apoplexy or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the way of the incision is so that the phlebotomes take away the blood from the head first: and extract it according to the measure of its usefulness.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the person sit between your hands, and turn their ear upward, and find a small hole in the base of their ear where there is some fat: and let it be a lunar shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with that, which is possible for you from the tools.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then pursue the hole from your time with speed, and take care of this, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	What if something falling into the ear is from one grain, which grows, and swells: then administer extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If he does not obey you at the exit, then take a rod with your hand, subtle, in this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the ablation of this kind of grain that falls on the ear, and do not make it, when you think, that this grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put many whips: then remove them with a hook, or with a subtle gesture, or with suction, as we have said, because the extraction of it is soothing.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But if the water is poured into the ear, it should be used by the sick with sneezing when he is first dressed: and he has already filled his ear with some cooked elderly water: and he lies on that ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he goes out through it, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, fine, soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and introduce one from them into the hole of his ear: and let it come out on the foot of him on that part, and hit it with another stone against the stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So he will not stop doing this with stones and stones, until all the water goes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And the water goes out so that you take it from the pot, or from the bucket, and insert its end in the ear: and light the end with fire, until it is burned a lot.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the bucket, and do this many times, until all the water goes out: and remove it with a tube according to what has been said in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction, if there is an animal inside it, if its body is small, like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I have said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a body of great size, which seems to the sense: then administer the extraction of it with gestures and hooks: and its nature is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	When you are extracting the hair from the ear, and you treat it with the method we spoke of in the dissection and the distillation treatise, your treatment will not be effective: then you must see the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If however there appears anything of the hair there, then extract that with the gesture, or with a fine hook.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however there appears nothing of the hair there, then take a tube, which has this shape, narrowed at the bottom and widened at the top; and introduce its thin end into the ear according to the quantity that it tolerates it: then suck with it strongly.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this repeatedly, until all the hairs come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you to the exit, then cover the tube around with ceruse, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they do not go out with it that I said: then administer the distillations which the ancient people experienced in the infection of the hair: and you will find it in the treatise of the distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your flow be as it is poured oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, which shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see do it yourself of silver or brass, narrowed below, in which sits a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Then let it be made as it drives what is in the anxiety of the tube, sitting of brass poorly done.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want, take the ray, and rub it with a cotton ball in the solution slowly: then pour oil, or juice, or what you want from these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then introduce the ray with the cotton wet, and throw it out with your hand slightly compressed, until it drives out oil in the anxiety of the hearing, and feels it inside: and let that which is infused into the ear already be warmed a little with fire: and let not remain anything that distills therein coldly: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Of the cure and treatment of ear accidents.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When certain children come out of their mothers' wombs not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And also it has happened to certain men that the ear has been injured by an arrow, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this injury to the ear, when it has occurred in a deep cavity, does not respond to cooling: and when it happens on the outside of the cavity a little bit, and results in cooling it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That therefore which has happened in a deep ear, and which does not comprehend the aspect, is in many aspects difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which results in cooling, you should put gold ointment on the ear, and examine it: then if you see an apparent injury, open it with a thin spatula, whose shape is this one which follows, let the end of it be where there is some small width, of which some part is sharp: and the other spatula of the two sides should be soft: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the injury is from flesh born in the ear's cavity: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease of cutting, until all the flesh is taken away.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If however the injury is in a deep ear': then take a small ray of wood, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it on the ear cavity.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel an injury with it, that with which there is a heaviness of hearing, try to open it with ease: and carefully, so as not to hurt the ear nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear liquid silver according to the quantity of the cavity's width, which you have made up with Egyptian ointment: let it be for a few days, until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take silver and pour it into rose water, and powder it over it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see an ear already suppurating: then it is necessary that you remove the pus and let it be with the poultice of another one, which you will rub in a green color that has been made with rose oil, until it is well cured: then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If however there is a flow of blood: then dip a sponge, or a cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the remaining cure, which stops the flow of blood as described in the book on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	The care for the eyelids of Al-Thabi.
Caput VIII.	Head VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the ailments of the eyelids of the eye when they are moist and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with tenails: or with an unguentary, and rub them from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place on the affected areas ground turpentine.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For often they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	The care for the eyelids of the eye of the grandine.
Caput IX.	Head IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often there is something in the eyelids that becomes hardened with the strength of grandine, and for that reason it is called grandine; and it is an accumulation of moist grossness in the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Operation then on them is to consider if there is grandine coming from it which appears on the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Then find over it a gap across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then remove the skin from all parts easily until it bleeds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it on a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If you don't prepare it for you with a ligature, unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with an incision just a bit, then that will hurt the sick person a little.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Which if the wound is large: then gather it together with sutures: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, then do not cause yourself any harm from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointments will restore it, and make the flesh grow back.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the breach is large towards the inside of the ear against its surface on the inside, then turn the eyelid upside down, and secure it with a ligature: besides that, you will have to make an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	Which if the eyelid is made long by the incision, then that will not hurt that in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision with salt water: and care for the place where it is growing back, until the sick person heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ Of the care of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a grease that grows on the eyelids: and it often happens that young people have it; and it hurts their eyes, and causes cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because their tears flow towards them, and because of that their eyes are always resting on their cheeks, and under their eyebrows, which are wet with the swelling: and the appearance of Axirnath is evident to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way that it works is that the sick person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare it with incisions, and make a circle out of it for the amount that contains Axirnath completely.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it on top of it, and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of his humidity with a sponge incident fissures by width, and not there is a greater fissure which makes in phlebotomy in deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you find the skin all, until you reach the axilla for many indeed in many dispositions proceeds the axilla from a fissure according to form of pale white.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract therefore her with cloth whom you infiltrated between your fingers to the outside: and you roll up your hand to right and left, until it is scattered: and carefully, do not add to the fissure, so that you do not find with a sponge to the eye, and you leave him.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if appears to you the axilla at first of the fissure, you add to the fissure a little with ease, until it proceeds the axilla.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract her, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and squeeze him with flour.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are who rub salt, and put it in the concavity of the fissure, that the remaining of his humidity is liquefied.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for her, until she heal.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if it happens in the place a boil hot, then care for him with plasters soothing, until he heal.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	De the ways of Ataxmir eyes, that is, when the eyelid softens eye, where it is from he wrinkling like not should.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When they grow in the eyelids of hair added besides the course under the natural hair, and antedate: then they hurt his eye, and make happen of the ways of diseases, such as frequent tears, and softening of the eyelids, and whiteness, until it is from this cause destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir indeed eyes are cared for according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to which is premised in the chapter of cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	He [the surgeon] cures Ataxmir with an incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through a tube, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you put the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then, with your left hand, close the eyelids of the eye.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it [the eye] has been closed, then good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, where lies the hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with a thread from above, and let the thread be close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and close it with a ring.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner side of the eyelid, under the hairs added with a needle incident from the larger tear to the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cotton or cloth: then seal on top of the eyelid with caustic, which is like the figure of a leaf of Myrtle.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it should be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies greatly among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From them is he who wants an incision from the eyelid, according to the quantity that softens it from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then find on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the larger tear to the smaller tear, and let there be a single slit close to the natural hair, as is the thickness of a toothpick.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one or two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape all of it off.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join together with a suture the two lips, with an aiguille and a thin thread: and wipe away the blood, and let adhere whatever excess hangs from the hairs above the two eyebrows, with some viscous substance if you want to make it hold: and if not, then do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the stitch and thread for three days, or four: then take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if it is a wound, let go of the stitch and thread, and take care of it with that, which dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid should be removed at the wound's sealing and aggregation: but a better one is to come.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	Such a method of treating was taught by the ancient Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern about the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way of Ataxmir'S is also: and that is, as a sign on the eyelid, figure like a fig-leaf, as we have related.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then wipe the eyelid with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this form which follows, then cut off what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with an equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you cannot hold the hook, and it does not fit: then take a sharp one in which there is a thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the tear, and a third near the smaller tear: and gather the threads between your fingers with an equal length.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wipe your hand with an equal wiping: and wipe the skin over that which is marked with a dot, as we have related.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if a puss occurs at your incision, or a crack: but that puss with white, and these similar ones, sit on unguent-plasters.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when it happens that the eyelids also turn their hair.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary, therefore, that you use on this what we have said about the incision: but the stitch is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with the hooks.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	It is necessary that you open your eyelids and cut the crease that is inside, as I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then, using the technique of the two canes or thin sticks, their length being according to the length of the eyelids and their breadth being less than the width of a toothpick: and you have already marked out on the outside extremities where the sutures are to be made on either side.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join together with care each of the two sticks on top of what is in excess from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly tie the two sticks on either side with a strong knot, and leave it for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is tight and will die, and will be destroyed, and will rot, until it falls away of itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then there is a delay, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then it has hardened, the eyelid is raised up: and there are no hairs that prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	This is the form of the two canes, which you make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	As for the raising of hairs that prick in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is, so that you may hold a fine needle, and introduce it into the eye with a fine silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then join together the ends of it, and tie each end with a fine knot, and make the length of the threads be the width of one fingernail.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then join together with a silk thread under the eye another fine thread, and tie the ends of it if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then put the weak head of the patient in your lap, and bring it near to the light so that the operation may be seen: for this operation is subtle, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the silk thread into the root of the eyelid, and let it enter rapidly into the eyelid until it comes out again by a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then put the bolt up to above the anus: and insert into the anus that bolt; if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then take your hand with it, until it comes out with the anus on the eyelid with the natural thread.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however the anus is pulled out and does not come out with it: pull out the anus towards the bottom with the thread that you have put in it until the anus comes out from the upper opening, and close your eye: then pull out the anus and the thread as well: and take them both out, and shut your eye: and let him stay closed for two days or three, until the thread adheres to its place, and grows over the anus on the flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	That if the thread is short, then either fasten it to a long thread from the natural threads, and let it go with it: or let him go, until it grows longer in space, and then let him go.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	The cure of Al-Khazani which happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Al-Khazani is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the accidental one is made from the congealing of blood, or from a section, or from a caustic, and like these things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation in it is, that you may find that congealing, and that you separate its lips, and put in it what is between them from linen, and bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you use in it those things which dry and tighten: for if you do so, Al-Khazani will come back worse than it was: but use in it those things which soften, such as fenugreek: and dip it with water, in which there is boiled althea, linseed: and anoint it with dyaquilon oil, which melts when mixed with some of the oils: and wrap it up with linen thread, and cure it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	Your repository of knowledge is so that you may seek with all your intellect to prevent it from being solidified according to the form that it had in the beginning.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this very operation which we have spoken of is nothing but a certain correction of the work of Albucasius so that it may not return to its original form.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the cure performed by Albucasius on the lower eyelid, which is a wringing or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	XIIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This which is done below by Albucasius is what is truly called Albucasius.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural and also accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is made by a wound, or a crack, or cautery, and those similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of this operation is that you should take a piece of thread, and touch it to the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear gland to the right until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with a sharp instrument, and cut it with a chisel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the form of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a ray, and place it in the crack, and turn it with it: and find two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and are the ends of the two cracks from two angles of incision, until they meet and form a corner: until, when they are gathered together, is formed this figure, and it is the letter "Ω" in Greek.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from where it follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather together the separate parts: and sew them with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which we have spoken about, regarding soothing medicines, and liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Albucasius has happened by a crack, or suture, or cautery: then you must find a flat crack between the lashes of the eyelids, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a knife, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the speech about the cure of Alxasar, when it is above or below, is that it should be prepared according to the form of Alxasar so that the operation proceeds on it.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For itself it is very diverse in form: and the prudent artist prepares his mind with whatever method is possible for him, until he sets out on the way to restore the shape to a natural state, or close by it; and himself also, when sick, according as it suits him from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Regarding the adhesiveness of the eyelids of the eye with the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	So that this consolidation happens to many people so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whiteness of the eye and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the tip of the knife under the eyelid and raise it up; or that you extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a very fine scalpel so that it does not cut the sharpness of the scalpel, but rather is slightly blunt; so that the sick person is not disturbed in his operation, and moves the scalpel, and injures his eye with its sharpness; and let your incision be almost like you remove this adhesion with ease, until when it returns the eyelid according to its natural form, and heals all the adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour into the eye a saline water, with which to wash it: or distill it into it from an essence made from dissolved zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a fine knife; and put on the eye wool immersed with albin (a kind of white substance); and after three days use the essence, and with consolidants, until healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Regarding the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	It is nerve-like: and it is similar to the hard sifaca, delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-like, similar to the frost of white snow: which when it touches iron, or gets held by a hook and pulled away, does not stick to it, and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin, unless from the larger tear, until it is slowly seen, until it has grown wet, and stops the light, and the eye's movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And his mode of operation in incising it is: that he may put his sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and spread his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take a little hook with a small tang, and extend it toward the top.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a little nail with a small tang, and extend it toward the top. Then insert a pin from the horse's hair, or a nail: and fasten the thread firmly, and double its end a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and bind the thread to the nail, and extend it toward the top: and scrape it with the hair on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair until its re entry.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut away the residue in the root of the lacrimal bone with a sharp chisel, or with small tweezers: and remove the natural flesh of the lacrimal bone so that its usual course is not interrupted by the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a sharp chisel, whose shape is as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful that the chisel does not touch the horny tunic, and that it does not tear it, or pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, put a little crushed salt in the eye, or make a paste from zinc, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary until he recovers.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not a bruise and you cannot get into it now, nor does it cause a wound, then this species of the nail, with medicines, should be cared for often, and he recovers like those who are narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you must cut into it, then open the eye of the wound, and take a thin, soft, sharp awl, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is getting thinner and tighter, and it presses on the nail, then distill from your own hour in the eye made of fine sand from amethyst or red powder, or salt ground: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat this operation on him again until he is completely cured.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless it is against you in the eye a warm pucker: for then let go of it, and care for the pucker, until he recovers.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on him with the razor again, until he recovers.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except for the membrane of the eye, if it hurts greatly in the eye, then suspend it with a hook, and cut off a piece from its end: and do not make the last cut, so that the course of the tears does not run.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then distill in the tear a red powder, or made from amethyst, until he recovers.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incisions of the alguardence, and with flesh born in the eye:
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It grows when there is red flesh in the eyes of men, whether mixed with white or lying on top of it, until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it is absorbed into the rose-dawn.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also that he puts his sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and take him by the flesh all round with a suitable hook; and hold it with one forceps, or grasp.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut into his flesh first, until you have finished off all of him with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful from his eye so that you do not wound him at the operation: and let your incision be whatever it is that you incise, or with a chisel, which we have spoken of in incising the nail: or with small forceps, with which Abael is caught up, according to how his form comes after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete, and all the tissue has been removed, then fill his eye with crushed salt: or distill into it red powder, and such like from his medicine corrodents: and put over his eye a cotton wisp with alumen: so that it is secure against infection from the hot air.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains any of the algardenici, and the warm blood masters you, and you are afraid of a hot pustule: then discharge his eye, and tend him with care as he sits with the pustule.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on him again, until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And likewise do with the flesh that has been added which happens to the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you keep your hands off all these operations unless you are operating with a iron instrument: and do not put your hand into any of these operations, until you know, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebaels are little red spots that grow on the eye, and prohibit the vision of his operation: and weaken the eye with the passage of the days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first, that you should consider, if the eye in which Sebel is has strength, and there is no disease in it but Sebel: then take Sebel out of his.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is as for you to instruct the sick person, that he may put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those feet with a hook, one or two according to your prudence: and may the hook be thin of double length, according to this form, or there be two hooks gradiated in the body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then with delicate forceps collect those feet with care, and wipe the blood every hour, until you have removed the nail from the eye, and it has healed: and do not leave the eye open with the tips of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your surgery be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your surgery muchly: lest you fall but those feet.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have rinsed out, then pour in the eye slight viridescent, or red: that its acuteness may corrode what remained of the sebum.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you are not able to collect all that in that hour, then patch the eye with that, that it may soothe the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until the pain of it subsides: and keep it away from the heat of the sun: then repeat over it after the same manner, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	De the reduction of a nose
Caput XIX.	Head
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors call a tube, which they put in care of the cautery, or with acute medicine burning, according to what preceded its narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you discover the opening of the bump at its birth, and take out all the moisture that is in it and pus, until you find the hole.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	But when the hole is discovered, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then grind it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the grater of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let iron be forged into a rod, and let its head be round like an ax, that it may be pierced with the edge of a file or with fine fileing; and set the bar in place on the damaged bone site.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn the bar between your fingers and press your hand lightly until you know that the corruption is now well-sharpened; and do this a few times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the site with dried-out styptic powder.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the site is consolidated, and a bone comes up from within, and the wound heals together: and remains for forty days, and does not re-open or ooze out or suffer any accident: then know that it has been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the tube into the naso-frontal passageway, following this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And is, that you may extract the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when you have located the bone, then take a second tweezers following this form, its end being round of shape, like an awl; and let its wood be like a pyramid extended to the tip, as you see it.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then set it down on the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal bone: and extend your hand from the eye a little way.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the tweezers, until it enters the bone, and feels weak: by this you will know that warmth is coming out of it when it holds its hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	So then restore the site with dried-out styptic powder, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then a bone comes up and the site hardens: then the substance which had flowed out to the outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter over the weak point.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	As for reducing the prominent eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye goes out with all its contents, and no accident happens to the vision, nor any decrease: then you should open the eye socket: then apply a bleed; afterwards place wind-vaporous things on the socket without skin-cutting, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put a lotion on the eye that is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocollus.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tightly close the eye above with a paste of many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the quantity of powders is this: that you take soft fabrics, many and double, all four together: make them many: then put them one on top of the other, according to the amount that the eye needs: then tightly close them with a hard fabric, strong tension.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And then wash with water without scratching.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the washes, and release the eye bound during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bond becomes soft again, then it must be tightened a lot: then remove the bond after day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	But if you see that the eye is already healing with the new bandage, it is good: and if not, then again apply the lotion, and the tightness, and the washes, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Regarding the incisions of the bandages.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture has occurred in the membrane of the eye, then it is cut and removed outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and nourishes it into the form of a human being, and pierces it: then the operation is carried out according to what it is like: and it is like to stick it in the root of the eye from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another one where there is a double filament on the side of the lacrimal, and let it penetrate: and then remove the first one according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the spot where there is a double filament, and tie that part of the eye around the needle: and tighten it a lot.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove it now, and put on the eye wool dipped in alba: and release it, until the filament drops with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes when he is drawn up from all parts with a circle of cloth until he adds an eye with great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce it with a sharp scissor so that it penetrates to the bottom of the eye, and the moist albaughin comes out and the eye sinks in and enters at once: then bind it up until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ Of the Treatment of Albucasis.
Caput XXII.	Head XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnatus, is not anything but the formation of a film on the eye, similar to the water that drops down and it itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of procedure in this is, that you cause the sick person to sit on a prepared chair, or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from the two parts, and move it so that you see the film coming down to the bottom of his eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then plug it up so that it does not drop down, and restore the light: and let the sick person see things as they are. And if it does not drop down below, you shall know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If the descent of the film with him is not prepared as we have said, then cause the sick person to sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a sharp scissor, and find it with him slightly above the connection of the skin film with the corneal envelope on the edge, until the film goes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has gone out then distil into the eye a hot water with which you have mixed honey: or water with which you have already boiled wheat-grass and honey: then take care of the rest of the cure, until it heals up.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Of the treatment of water that drops down into the eye, or a cascade.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the types of water and what is suitable for piercing, and explaining and demonstrating: then take the same water according to the health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you should cause the sick person to sit between your hands in a square position, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his sound eye, and bind it tightly: then with your right hand close the eyelid of the eye from which the water comes, if the eye is left-eyed: or with your left hand, if the eye is right-eyed.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the almond, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the almond close to the eye's crown by its thickness in the same color as the lacrimal gland apparent: then press the almond with force: and you roll it with your hand, until it penetrates into the eye's white: and you will feel that the almond has already reached the tear-producing part.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it should be such that the almond' s path to the depth is a measurement of space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil of the eye by tears, because of the clarity of the cornea' s membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almond until it is in the spot where is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the very one down with a gentle pressure after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water immediately goes down, then at once one will see that it opens its own eye' s vision immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you rest a little bit.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then the water goes down again, then put it down second, except that the almond comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then does it set, and does not go up again: then remove the almond with ease: and you roll your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt from the jewel: and rinse with it the inside of the eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over all the eye' s whole patchwork, or a wool soaked in rose oil, and in the white part: and bind it with that to the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are our time' s, put over it a finely-ground powder of the white part mixed with oil.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if the almond does not yield to you at the entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then you must take the "Alberid" branch, which this name has, and whose form is as follows.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	So pierce it then with that same thread, and do not put your hand into the hole; and there is no need but to make a small hole for the needle.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And near the end of your operation, prepare for the sick person a room in which he may lie on his back in a dark house; and prohibit all movement and coughing; and place before him food by which nature feeds him; and do not let him move his head to the right or to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligament rest according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark house, and test his vision; and make him see objects at a distance.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he should do this at the time of his cure, or immediately after the incision; but let him do it when he is far from home; for water quickly rises by the feverish look.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a feverish blister appears: then it is necessary that you should loosen the eye before the seventh day: and straighten out the blister with him as he sits; then restore his vision, and let him lie on his face for several days while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out of the house gradually, and let him turn in bed.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that a student is not excused from vision while lying in bed; then he should be able to hear about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed one of those from Al-Ayrab has already come to us; he said that it was done in Al-Ayrab with an almond through which water rises.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed no one in your country has ever done that; and it is not written in any of the ancient books: but it is possible that it is a new thing.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the speculum from gold, so that it remains on top of him who knows not.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of fine silver: and let their ends be with this same subtlety triangular, and the acute end.
Formae magda.	The forms of gold.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of birthmarks on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and if they arise in the nose, various meats are added from which something is absorbed that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from it is that cancerous flesh, stone-hard, of pale color: and from it is that mild flesh, not pale-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Now then, if there is that kind of meat from these, which is mild and not deceitful or cancerous, you should make it sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open its nostrils, and thrust in the hook: then draw it out toward the outside, and cut off what you have grasped with a sharp, fine hook on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been taken away.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	That if there is anything left of it from which its removal is not possible: then you should rasp it with a single sharp instrument with ease until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, your blood rules over you, or a feverish blister occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary: or if it comes from malicious blisters, then approach it with cauterization, until the blood is stopped and all flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let it be thrown into the nose after a caustic has been cut, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it all the way to the palate, then you know that he has already recovered his health.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then you know that within the upper bones of the nose there is a birthmark to which the knife does not reach with an incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you should insert a thread with some grossness, and spots of many in it: and place between each spot a quantity of a finger, or less: and let him cough up one end of the thread into the nose by radiation, or by whatever means he can after he has done so himself like azur: and take his sniff, until it reaches to the throat, and let it go out onto his tongue.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, often do these boys make like this Atomo in school: and it is a easy thing to him that will.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then put two ends of the thread, one end that goes out on the nose, and the other remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then tighten the knot of the thread with the nodes that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already tied up with the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread: and put in the nose after the withdrawal of blood the liniment that you drank in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten up all that remained of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the matter a plumb-tipped cannula in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it requires healing that it dries up, use this.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the lavage at the head, when oil is distilled, and other medicines in the nose, make it of silver, or of brass: that it be similar to a small lamp, opened like a shell-fish: and its channel also.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed cannula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for lavage at the head be full, and closed: which has a handle at the end, so that you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever fluid you use, and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	The cure for the nosebleeds:
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Frequently, a nosebleed arises at the end of the nose, and it increases, and becomes more noticeable over time, until it is a kind of black spot.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this, at the beginning of its appearance, you should cut it off completely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put over the spot, or a cautery, or a burning medicine that is placed in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	But if the cutting off of it is delayed until it increases, then examine it, if it be hard, red in color, dull in feeling: then do not touch it with an iron: for it is a kind of cancer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many a time he saw an apostema on his patient, and it happened to him that a great malignancy arose from it which touched the man himself who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apostema is mild, and not discolored, and you see that the incision is possible all over it, then wash the sick one, and incise himself without fear, without dread: and attend to the place with it, until it heals over.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Regarding the sewing of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26 on Head.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know That when it happens that the separation of the continuous cartilage is little in it, the operation is not very effective unless in certain humans.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when it happens to someone that something of it is in need of repair, so consider, if the wound is recent with its own blood: and then add some grief to the wound with the incision: and then attend to the man, until he heals over.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separation of the continuous cartilage has already separated the lips, and some part of it is whole: then it is necessary that you cut off all its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then add the two lips with an incision, and tighten them, and sprinkle on the man dragon's blood, and ground olive, and put over the powders a fragment of plaster of Paris, and some other of consolidated plaster: and let the man be bound with two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then solve him, and change his medicine: and let the man go, until the threads separate from themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then attend to the man with ointment, until he heals over.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The way of the incision is that you add the solution of the continuous cartilage, or with the bone, as we have told you about the incision of the eye: or you add the solution with a thread, as I told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of the nodules from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27 on Head.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people happen to have hard-like bumps on their inner lips: and some of them are small, and some are large.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you close the lips, and find on all his nodes, and hang him with a hook, and throw him down from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after incision is dried three times until the blood is cut off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then soak it with vinegar and treat the spot with it where there is a stasis until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Regarding the incision of the flesh that has grown on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Head VIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often a tooth grows out on the gums, which the ancient call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you should hang it with a hook: or hold it with tweezers, and throw it down at the root, and let the blood run, or let the blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the place that has been dried three times, or other stinging powders, drying agents.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	Which if this tooth returns after treatment, for it often returns again, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: because it does not return after the cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Regarding teeth grinding with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they are gathered together on the surfaces of teeth from the inner and outer parts, and between the gums there are rough,鋭く、そして時には黒ずんで、黄色に変色し、まで腐敗して根元に及ぶと。
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Then cut off the sick hand between your hands, and hold the head in your lap, and grind the tooth and bone that show you the tissues, and such-like sand: until there remains nothing of it, and likewise deal with blackness, yellowing, and sourness, and until they are all cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then that which is taken out of them from the beginning of grinding is good, and if not, then cut them again on another day, a second time, and a third, until you come to the last study in it that you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth requires various shapes of saws and many figures: in order to prepare your operation; for the saw which cuts the tooth from the lower part is different from the saw which cuts between teeth according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of saws are prepared in you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you heal the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and delay in eradicating it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For the tooth is not so soft as to be eradicated: since it is substantial; until there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then you should consider when it is weak to eradicate it, so that it hardens and is certified with you, the aching tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the weak, and he thinks that it is in a tooth and eradicates it himself: then the pain does not retreat until the aching tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen this from the operation of blood-letting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When the aching tooth is certified with you, then you should cut into the surrounding of the tooth with a spatulum, in which there is some strength, until it has healed the gums from all parts: then you should move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps first little by little, until you dislodge it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then, when you have located the place in it of good size, and the head is nursed between your thighs: then you hold it well so that it does not move: then you draw out the tooth with care according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If then it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and introduce it beneath it from all parts with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then you should fill it with cloth: and you should hold it with a small end of the forceps, so that it does not break at the time of your contraction on top of it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	It is necessary that you should cut very carefully with the scarifier around the gum from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength well so that you do not break it and a part of it remains and returns to the ill from that which causes him greater pain first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And let them not do that which the phlebotomists do in their haste and audacity to eradicate it, except that they give it what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often bring about great ailments in men, of which it is more difficult to break and all the roots remain, or some of them: or to extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if a flow of blood should come from places (for often it happens) then let them dry some of the wound, and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it if it does not give you a wound.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the forceps are subtile that move the dens in the first place, have long extremities, short manubria, thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth with them: they are as you see the thick manubrium, until when you squeeze them together, they do not bite themselves, and do not double: the short extremities, and let them be made of iron bar, or from a cast-off piece of iron, straight extremities: and in their extremities are teeth, some of which enter into some, and squeeze by constriction, firmly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the extremities are made as the form of the ear that is called a ciconia, and they are strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth, and extraction of the bones of the mandible fractures.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When a tooth remains after the eradication that breaks something, then it should be placed on the cot with butter for one or two days, until it softens: and then introduce to it the claw or forceps: their extremities should be like the shape of the ear that is called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	Form a h e c i s f o r c i p u m .
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The form is thus of the forceps. They are to be made as if for cutting inside out: or as aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if he does not obey you at the exit with these forceps, then you must, in order to cure, cut on the root, and peel off all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small palanca, whose form is thus.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	The end should be shorter by about an inch; and not to be immersed, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	But if the root comes out through that, it is good; but if not, you must use other instruments, whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular end, in which there is some groosness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the second triangular end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also to be used with this instrument having two branches, whose form is thus.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the text about the teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also to be used with this instrument which is like a large hook; of the form of the second triangular end, twisted, in which there is some groosness, so that it does not break: and not to be immersed.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many instruments for the teeth; and likewise other instruments are not to be counted, and the skilled artisan discovers his art by himself alone; according to which the operation is of great benefit and effect upon the disease itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since from diseases are those for which the ancient instrument did not speak, due to the diversity of the forms of these.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jaw is broken from the molar, or from any other bone of the mouth, then to examine carefully upon it at its own place with that which belongs to it from instruments and forceps which I have spoken of in extracting the root, and to move with the gesture, whose form is thus.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	It should be some groosness gradually so that it holds fast, or it should hold with the jaw, and not escape and move, until it comes out from the jaw; and restore the place with suitable remedies for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is decay in bone, then cut off that part which is decayed, and cure that part, until it has healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the proper locking of teeth upon others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32: On proper locking of teeth upon others.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth do not grow at their proper angle, they become decayed because of their shape, and above all when this happens to women and girls, that is to say, those who are teething.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary for you to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if one tooth has come after another and does not fit in, nor can it be locked or trimmed: then cut off that one; and if it is joined to the next tooth, then cut it out with this instrument, whose shape it is.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small chisel, and is made of iron, and has a sharp extremity.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cut should be deep, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not move another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is exposed by its own trimming: then trim it with a sharp chisel made of iron, whose shape is like this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should all be made of iron, and its little tip should have a sharp point, like an aiguille; with which trim the tooth slowly day by day with ease, so that it does not move any other teeth and falls out: then smooth down the tip, and cut off the very end with some small razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	That if a tooth has broken off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to trim that too, until its roughness has been softened, and it has become smooth: and it should be made flat, so that it does not hurt the tongue or spoil speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On retaining teeth with gold fillings.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33: On retaining teeth with gold fillings.Si dens
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the anterior teeth are struck or jolted by a blow, and cannot be held tight to prevent them from falling out: and if the treatment with sharp medicine does not help them: then invent a way to hold them with gold wire, because gold turns green and decays after some time: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let it be placed in medio-ness between subtility and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the retention is so that you take the string and put it between two healthy teeth: then you sew with its two ends between the teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the thread up to a healthy tooth of the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the part from which you started: and with your hand tighten the string with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not move completely: and let your tightening be where you tie the string, next to the roots of the teeth, so that it does not move.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the string with pincers: and gather both together, and twist them together, and hide them between a healthy tooth and a tooth that has moved, so that it does not hurt the tongue: then let it be relaxed as much as it can remain strict.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it becomes loose or gets cut, tie it with another string, and it will stand with it in this way for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of retention of two healthy teeth and two teeth that have moved, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes one tooth returns, or two after falling and receding to their places, and remains as we have described, and does not do it unless the artisan is skilled, prudent, and expert.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone is broken: and it becomes like the form of a tooth, and it is placed in the place from which it has come out, where it is secured and tied, as we have said: and it remains, and is held with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the cutting of the ligament that is under the tongue, and which prevents licking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that is under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already been healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is, so that you open his jaw at the head of his throat and relieve his tongue; and then cut this nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any stiffness and tension there, and if it is due to a wound that has healed; then cut into the hook and finish across its width until you cut through the ligament, and thus relieve the tension.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful not to make a wound deep into the flesh, and then cut into the artery there, and let blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wet the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a piece of linen that holds the injured together all night, so that it does not solidify again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is any bleeding, then put three pieces of cloth over the wound site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the blood injures you, then burn the site with a wart-burn, which is suitable for it; and then care for yourself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The extraction of the wound that is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there is a little blister under the tongue that absorbs a small wound, it prevents the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it increases so much, that the jaw is filled up.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is, so that you open the jaw away from the sun: and observe the blister.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that the wound is of a dark color, or black, and hard, for which the injured has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it falls to whiteness, and has moisture: then cut into it with an hook, and free it from all parts with a fine scalpel.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If the blood injures you during your operation, then place three pieces of cloth over the wound, until the blood stops; and then return to your operation, until it is completely extracted.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then clean with vinegar and salt: and care for it with due care for that one, until well.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	In the cure of abscesses of the two amygdaloids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When abscesses or swelling occur in the throat, that is, glands which resemble abscesses and occur due to infection; they are called the two amygdaloids: when you consider their cure with respect to what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then reflect.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If then the abscess is hard, red in color, few in sensation: then do not touch the abscess with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if its color is red and its root is thick: then do not touch the abscess even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, else you shall not only cease, until it has healed.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you shall pierce it: or it will burst of itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if its color is white, round, and its root is thin: then the abscess should be opened.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is such, that you consider beforehand its operation, if the abscess of his own accord has become warm and quiet complete, or is about to decrease in some way: then make the sick one sit before the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and take hold between their hands, and rub their tongue with an instrument whose this is the form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it may be sharp like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press it with the instrument and an abscess appears to you on your tongue: then take hold of a hook, and fix it into the amygdala, and extract it toward the outside as much as you can, except that you tear away some of the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument whose this is the form which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is joined with a twig: however its ends are curved so that the opening of each of them is on the other's acute angle: therefore care that it be of forged iron, or of pewter dipped in lead.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut him with a scalpel, which has this shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	But if it is acute on one side and not acute on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one amigdal, cut the other according to this same form of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then, after the incision, rinse the sick person with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if he bleeds, rinse him with water in which crushed cherry bark has been boiled: or leaves of myrtle and similar things from astringent; until the bleeding stops: and then take care of the patient, until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when, besides the two amigdalar, there arise in the throat other apophthems.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut them as I have said for cutting the two amygdali.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have already healed a woman from an apophelm that was born between her throat, which made her breath labored and weak, so that she could hardly breathe; who had closed her throat almost completely: and the woman breathed with difficulty through my mouth, and she no longer drank liquid, nor ate food, and she was close to death, if she remained for one more day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the apophelm had risen so much that it had thrown out two branches, until they came out of two holes of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I hurried and fixed my scalpel in one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled him out, and a large part came with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it was caught in the hole of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same for him as he came out through the other hole of the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; then I fixed my scalpel in the apophemma: then cut off a part of it, and there was little blood; so I began to heal her throat, and immediately she started drinking water, and afterwards she ate food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore, I have not stopped applying pressure from that point for a long time; and the pressure spot succeeded that which I was pressing until it was too much prolonged and with that it was that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore made this spot sensible, and cauterized between the nostrils.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It therefore remained stationary from the addition; then I walked away on one side, and did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of the wound.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the discharge descends to the opening, and is long, then it is called a vertical; and if it is thick and round, then it is called a wound.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When the cure is applied to it as we have said in the division, and does not bring about a cure; and you see that the pressure spot has become cool from it, and thin: then you should apply pressure to it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered from it is round, and has no length, and is bloody or fustian color, or black, and does not have a feeling: then you should make the wound in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For fear is in the wound on the sick.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	So you should, when you see it in the second way as I have said from whiteness, and with its length, that you set the sick person in front of the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument which has gone before: then fasten a hook on the wound, and pull it down: and cut it with one or two instruments which I have said in cutting the two nostrils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not apply pressure from it, unless that is added to the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you apply pressure from it too much, you wound the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we have said in the incision of the two nostrils: and take care of it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the sick person shudders from the incision; then you should use your wit in cauterizing it without fear and anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The way to perform cauterization is not in it, except with sharp water; and it is as if you put the head of an nurse in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have told you to take in the chapter on cauterization, and add it to this calcein which is not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill it with the concavity of this instrument, whose this is the shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit at the end of him where the medicine is applied, as is the concavity of the radius screw.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on his wound: and the sick man let him lie on his side, so that he runs a salve from his mouth by the inner medicine, so that it does not go down to his throat anything, and hurts him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first put on him a half-portion of the medicine for an hour, until you see it is now worn away, and then to lay the medicine with a tingling sensation.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take a coat and wrap him over the end of the radius, and pour the coat with the medicine, and insert the radius with the coat into the tube from above, until it adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you get what you want about cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let him go: for he will heal himself and fall after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you want to apply the medicine again, repeat it: and after cauterization wash around him a new coat with butter-milk, and clean up with it what is around him from the medicine: and then wipe with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And heal outside with broths, and inside with gargles, until he is well.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This then is the nature of surgery to be healthier than incisions and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes it is also used with a vaporization, since it is finer than cauterization and incision: it is used in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Gather up thyme and hyssop and oregano and rue and sage and chamomile and abbots' moss and similar herbs; put them all together in a bowl, add some vinegar and let it boil: and the bowl should be covered well with a lid: and there should be an opening on top of it where the instrument is inserted as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze: and the extreme end, in which is the needle, should enter the opening of the tube until the vapor rises towards the bore hole, until it is obscured much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this many times, until it has dried up.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And do not make this cure at the beginning of an apoplexy.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Indeed, you should not add it during an apoplexy: and it is not appropriate to do this if the apoplexy is due to a hot cause.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a pipe and fit the end with a piece of wood so that it does not burn the tube's opening: because the wood prevents the vapor from burning the opening: and this is a good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Regarding the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38. On the Extraction of Spines and Bones from
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone would adhere to the throat, or a fish spine, or something else..
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then it is necessary that you should extract whatever appears to be stuck on top of what makes the throat close up, after you press the language with an instrument against the sun, and tell me what is stuck in your throat..
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And whatever does not show itself to you and hides in the throat, you must make a sick man before he digests food in his stomach..
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps what is annexed will come out through the vomiting..
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	The sick person should swallow the end of a rope made from the roots of a nettle, or the radices of a lettuce, or the end of a dry bread loaf; or he should take the end of a sea sponge that is dry and soft: and he should tie it with a thread, then he should swallow.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	And when he has reached the place where there are spines or an ear, and it is taken out, then he leaves.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if he does not leave with it as I said above: then use the instrument made from lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be larger than the radius by a little, and at its end let there be a slenderness, which he may introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head elevated.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him avoid touching his epiglottis, so that he does not cough and push the food out with it, or insert a spine, or introduce the doctor's hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the sick person inserts (it), which is better: through his knowledge of the site of the injury; and he pushes down or holds his hand up with the instrument, all of it according to the quantity prepared for him, until it leaves (his throat).
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Regarding the extraction of blood:
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is treated with a medicine that I mentioned in the division of healing with doctors, and does not show, then consider in the throat before the sun, or by the sun after you have pressed its tongue with an instrument that I have told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	But if your yawning falls on the leech, then extract it with a small hook, or with subtle gestures, without making yourself known.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a tightly made tube, and insert it into the throat as far as the throat; and then insert into the tightly made tube an ignited iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick person refrain from drinking any water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he should take a full treatment of cold water and open his mouth to it; and he should put his own mouth on it and not swallow anything from it; and he should moisten the water with his hand after one hour of the other.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For a swallow drops its food as soon as it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not leave with it what we have mentioned above, then he should smoke the sick one with herbs, or with a pipe instrument that we use for smoking in the case of a cough.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because he will drop it itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in smoking is that you take a bowl, in which are placed the seeds of violets with fire: and the bowl is covered with a lid, and the end of the instrument is placed in it: and the other end is placed in the mouth.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the smoking, and let the sick one put his mouth on the end of the tube, and shut his mouth so that it does not exit the smoking until you know that the smoke has reached the swallow.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For a swallow drops immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	That if it does not drop, then repeat the smoking many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick one endure hunger, and eat salt, and other things, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he leaves with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument from which the swallow is taken out of the throat when it drops on it itself.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: but because there is a smallness that enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to an ear (a little ear), which has a sharp edge of the file: and when it embraces something, does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	As for the opening of the apulum and its sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Head 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of apulum, many forms, according to which the memory comes to it, that is, one and the same in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation, and in the division of them from two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	This is one who has a pustule that is open and contains moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is by reason of places where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since the pustule occurs in the head, it is different from the accident of a pustule in the anus; and since the pustule occurs on tender skin, it is different from the accident of a pustule at the joints; and each has its own judgment according to operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the pustules there are which do not need to be pierced except after the blood has been hardened in them and its complement; and of these there are those which need to be pierced when they are raw and have not reached maturity according to their complement.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As for the pustules that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Since the pustule occurs near a joint and lingers until what is in its circumference perhaps rots the ligaments or nerve of that joint: so it is the cause of closer contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is a pustule on a main limb; for if you delay piercing it until it has healed over, it will hurt or damage that main limb or its members.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is near a joint, then pierce it when immature: and it is not necessary to pierce a raw pustule, which is incomplete digestion, unless it is near a joint so that it does not rot deeply and lingers towards the innermost part of the body and becomes a fistula, or remains at the edge of it where it does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time for piercing the pustule, which has healed over according to its complement: and it is during a lack of pain, a retreat of fever, a diminution of redness, pulsation, and sharpness in the head in the pustule; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you should make the same piercing in a lower place of the pustule, and more prominent: and let the piercing be made by cutting along the length of the body, if the pustules are in the parts of the hand and foot and places of the back and neck and nerves and arteries, and to the last in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, go with the puncture to the second member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however there is a swelling in the fleshy parts: then it is better that you should cease from puncturing it, until its digestion has been confirmed as we have said according to the second supplement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Since if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus extends from it, and it is full of decay and decay, and perhaps it hardens its lips, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some swellings are pierced according to the width of the body at necessity: or according to that in which the member lacks.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small puncture in small swellings and a wide puncture in large swellings: or sections according to the similarity of the size of the swelling.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are swellings from which the skin must be tightened: and it happens when it has already become like a cloth, and has reached its limit, since it is already dead: such as happened to many, as it bleeds, and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among them are those that cut off a section with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And among them is one which cuts like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As an swelling of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section: and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That however to which there is no head, such as are the gentle surface swellings, it is necessary that you pierce it with a superficial puncture, or just flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary that when the swelling is large and has already collected a lot of fluid, and you pierce it so that it does not go well and does not pour out all the pus at once: but extract a part from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then apply ointment to the swelling until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Make it many times according to the graduation, until it comes out: especially if he is weak and feeble of virtue, or a woman pregnant, or a small boy, or an old man decrepitous: for the spirit of the animal often resolves from the animal with the exit of the fluid: and perhaps the weak one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Hence this chapter with great prudence.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have made the incision, from which you make the stitches, it is necessary that you should wipe away the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then the wound of the stitch is small, or is a flat section, then administer wine from linen, or old oil.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the wound of the stitch is large, and there are many grooves of the incision, then it is necessary that you should introduce linseed into all the grooves, until they are completely closed.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the wound you have cut off a part of the skin, or have circumcised it: then it is necessary that you fill it with old oil, or as when the cloth is tightly sewn together, or is rubbed with linen wool without moisture: and tighten it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it off, and care for that with him what needs to be done from ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if blood flows during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar after it has been soaked up by the cloth: and place it on the spot of the flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you should administer a course of treatment and cure, and powders, which are mentioned in various places in our book here, and from a division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the season of winter, and the wound of the stitch is in many places sore: then it is necessary that you should introduce powders with wine and hot oil: and place them on the spots.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the season of summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you should place powders soaked in water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you should remove the stitch, and wipe away the wound, and administer to it what is suitable for its cure, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is why it is necessary to know the cure of all kinds of wounds.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Accordingly, I have already said regarding all types of wounds, which one explains separately; it is the way to a specific cure.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	De the separation of wounds that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small wounds on the skin of the head are of two types: nodules, which are surrounded by a membrane that serves as a sack for them; like the hen's own eggs.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many types of these nodules.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of them there are some thin ones; and of them there are those that contain a similar moisture; and of them there are those that contain a similar moisture, like the friskies and the puddings; and of them are hard pebbles.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And when separated from all of them, and their extraction is not dangerous, if one does not separate the arteries from them.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation of separating them is such that you experience it with a tool whose shape comes after this, which is called the "intromission", until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that is what contains moisture, then dry it by cutting it at a second length parallel to the first: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the separation from line B to line G. But when the moisture is emptied, then remove the skin that contains it; and do not leave any of it inside.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times if there remains any of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then dip the cloth in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with oil, and leave it for another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this corrosion of what remains from the skin will be.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment to the cloth a second time, and a third time; and if you tolerate it, until you are confident that nothing remains from the skin; then, for the sake of your tolerance, continue to apply the oil with the ointment, until it is cured.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a pinguid nodule, then dry it up according to this form, having the form of a cross: and cast out the hooks between the clefts of the section, and scórify it from every part: and prepare your strength in the extraction of the tunica which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it contradicts you with an artery, then do what I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And also do the same in an abscess, if it is hard, from the section, and the cure in the same way, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over a hard abscess is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And when some of these abscesses are in the head of some men, where there is no depth of moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I followed over an abscess in the head of a married woman, and found an abscess like a solid stone and hard, sharp, white, which could not be broken: and if it was hit with anything, it hurt the flesh.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other abscesses of accidents in the head, except these abscesses which happen in the heads of boys, and near the roots of the ears, all their sections are superficial sections.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a hole in them always from their lower part, that the course of the blood may go down to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for them with what suits them in the cure after it has been cured.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the Section of the Strophuli in the Neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often happen in the neck, and under the chin, and in the groin: and sometimes they happen throughout the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over these which happen in the neck, there is one common and many: they spring from a single spot; and all the strophuli come from within their own tunica, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of strophuli are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For these are the leaves: and these are those that contain moisture; and these are the ill ones, which do not yield to cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	For these are the leaves: and these are those that contain moisture; and these are the ill ones, which do not yield to cure.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is on guard, lest the venous should be incised or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let it not be acute and sharp, so that it does not give you your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick, and you fall, which is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or an artery, or stops you from the operation, then put in a tree tratum, or some powder which cuts off the blood, and tighten the tree, and let it go, until the sharpness of the apostema subsides, and the tree softens: or it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is cut off by the treamentSo put your treament in readiness for your operation, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then ask with your index finger if anything remains of the Staphyls others small: so cut them and clean them out.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	That if there is a large Staph in the root: then it should not be cut by the root itselfStaph: but it should be bound with a strong double thread, and let it go until it falls on its own without doing any harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the tree with old cloth, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for the wound.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	That if a whole Staph is cut, then you should collect the lips of two wounds: and clean them immediately after you see that there is no superfluity.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If, however, you see that the excess remains because of the size of the stump, then it is necessary that you understand to cut off its root and remove it: and administer the stitch which we have spoken about.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which of the stumps contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture: so that you see the site of maturity of it: and place the puncture away from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, after the puncture, apply a paste with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of corruption, until when you see the scar already healed: then care for it with a generating ointment of flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	§ On the section of the epiglottis from the tonsils within the throat by accident.
Caput XLIII.	Head 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones said that this section in the epiglottis, and there was no one in our land who did it: and this is a record of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those who have a syringe, the section of the epiglottis should be removed: with the exception of the following, because all the nasal passages and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those, however, who have a hot swelling in the mouth, or in the throat, or in both mandibles, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, in order to escape from the destruction which is done by pre-condensation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to open the epiglottis, let us pull the epiglottis under a circle of the epiglottis, or four, with a small section across the width, in that which is between the two circles by measure, that it may be a section in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, because it is private from flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the doctor is timid, then it is necessary that he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find the skin, until it reaches the canal: stop the blood with a cloth if you see any blood in it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then wipe off the skin that we have described: and show on the section of the canal from the phlegm that is discharged with it when it is stopped and when the wound is cut.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound be left open for a certain time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the fever abates at a certain hour, the two lips of the wound are to be joined together and to be joined only by the skin itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that make flesh grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Says Albucasis.The summary of the above speech, which we have described, is that when any of these wounds has begun to heal, and the sick person begins to recover from his illness and his fever declines: then he should stop bleeding and cut off part of his tissue to help him breathe more easily and save him from death. And for this reason they recommended leaving a wound open, until the evil of the disease is gone, and this evil is three days and almost four; then he should close the wound, and care for himself, until he heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I saw with my own eyes is that a female servant took a knife and put it into her throat, and pricked it with it, and injured a part of the lung canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found that she was breathing like a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Then I removed the wound, and I found blood flowing out from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore certain that she had not cut off her hair or combed it out: and a wind came out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	So I removed the wound and cared for him until he was well; and nothing happened to the servant except that her voice became hoarse: and she recovered after a few days.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Thus I say: for there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the sectioning of the hernia throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernial mass, named the hernia throat, is a large one, of the colour of the body; and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two causes: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly there is no art in the natural one.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, however, has two causes; one is similar to pimple-like nodes, and the other...
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an aphumatous ulcer, which is formed from the nodulation of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is a fear in it; and you should not make supposition about it with iron, unless it be small; and you should test it and investigate it with the probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If, then, you touch the hernial mass, similar to a pimple-like node, and it is not suspended with any veins: then you should dry up the mass, as you do with the nodes; and you should take it out with it if it is contained in a sac, and if it is not, then you should examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what is necessary to promote healing until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the sectioning of nodular species.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XL.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of nodes; and I have already spoken about their classification; and it is necessary for me to describe the difference between nodes and ulceration, while making a hesitation.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, then, that with ulceration there is heat, and fever, and sharp pains; until an efflux of pus is suppurated, and putrefaction is completed; for then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With node, however, there is no heat or fever or pain; and they are contained in a sac of their own, which is similar to the body colour; and it forms like beans, and resembles a sponge, and is larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either thin: or dry up moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to treat a wound, you should first test it and ask about it in the first place with the instrument called the introducer, as its shape will be described after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry about wounds and all kinds of nodules is that you should take this instrument and introduce it into a moist place where you have made the wound: and you will move your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then put the last hand of yours according to the size of the wound.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove the introducer and look at what comes out into the opening.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	But if moist matter is running out, whatever its color may be: then dry up the flesh with a superficial cut, as I have said in the other wounds.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moist matter is running out in the opening of the introducer, then you will know that it is fat: so dry up on top of the flesh with a cut in the shape of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrub the skin from all parts easily: and guard the crucium if you can above it, that you may take out the same healthy with the nodule.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the crucium is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to take out the healthy one, because this often happens: then take it out in a hurry, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains of it a little bit or much, the nodule will return according to most accounts.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	For if it has wounded you, and there remains of it a little bit: then fill the wound with certain powders that are corrosive and sharp: and tighten the bandage, and put it above the wound that sits hot, and take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a large knot, then cut his two lips and care for him with what is inflamed.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If on the other hand you have a fresh sore that throbs, or one that does not throbs: then make it close, and fill the space with three-day-old flesh, and leave him strict for two days, or three, until the knot putrefies, and the fever subsides: then return to cutting out what is left of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding instruments from outside the body for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter Xliv. On tools from outside the body for cutting and piercing
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of intrusions, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For out of these is the great, and out of these is the middle, and out of these is the small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made from iron an octagon with rectangular ends that slants inwardly so as to facilitate entrance into the socket.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	These are forms of piercing, and there is one kind, that is, the perforator; and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For out of these is the great, and the middle, and the small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	Let them be made to project from them apertures, and exits, and tubes, and abscesses from this one who is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, and sharp, and smooth, like the large needle with which cushions are sewn on; made of citron or of copper, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones are those made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also forms of black lead, which are made to project so that through them the tubes are experienced; and they have reflections with which they gently reflect against them.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again they are of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For out of these are the long, and from these is the medium, and from these are the short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the tube and the tightness of its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Form of the ring, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For they are simple ones, that is to say, those in which there is one curvature: and they are of three kinds, as you see, great, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from these there are blind ones: and they too are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these there are those that have two curvatures, and they too are of three kinds; and from these there are those that have three curvatures, and they too are of three kinds; and all of these are necessary in their own place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the forms of Scalpel, with which they cut and ablate nodes and pustules; and they too are of three kinds: for from these there is a great one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which they make the section are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus except that with them is made an incision of a wound or of a nerve; and so heal it peripsus, and find some quiet from the burn as does by excoriation of pustules.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are called "great", and these are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	These are made of brass, and they are similar to the "ray" with which alcohol is made; and in its upper end there is a hidden point called "spatumilis": and in it runs to the inside, and to the outside when you look at it, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the  "spatumilis" that is hidden between the fingers at the perforation of pustules; and they do not feel it when you touch it; and they are of three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the "ventosa" with which is cut off the flow of blood; and they are of three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of brass, or of yellow bronze, round, to some extent, like what you see; and let them be of some fineness.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let these species of   "ventosa" be with you great and small; so that you cut off blood through them when there is a need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	Indeed, you should not use them for the ablation of blood in any part of the body, and you should not use them unless in meaty places: such as the legs, hips, upper arms, nipples, wrists, groins, and similar places, from the meaty parts, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made from them small instruments like the blades of a knife, according to their shape: which cut blood when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or an artery: and when they are made from them round ones according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Regarding the care of the nipples of men which resemble the nipples of women in shape.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the nipples of some men are inflated at the time of sleep until they resemble the nipples of women and remain hard to the touch.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever wishes to avoid this should dry the nipples with a lunar section, according to this form from the line, b to the line, g. Then scrape the whole nipple.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the nipple with a medicinal ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together the two lips of the wound with a stitch, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the nipple turns downward and becomes soft due to its size, as happens to women: then it should be found in its two sides at the top with two sections similar to the lunar form, each containing the other at both ends, until it is joined by a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from the line, b to the line, g. Then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the nipple, and administer what we have said about the stitch and powders, which is necessary in the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not wish to cut it as is necessary to cut it due to a tremor or a flow of blood: then fill the nipple with a cotto unguentum corrosivum, and let it go, until it corroded what remained of the nipple.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for himself, until he is well.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	For a hole in the anus that happened during the time of Thylicus.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 58.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These hemorrhoids that occur during the time of Thylicus are of a hard kind, which has a skin and from which emerge moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Since, then, of those that contain moisture, it is necessary to cut with a lunule, according to this form, from the line B to the line G; and when all that is in the hemorrhoid has been drained out, then fill it with old ointment, and let it go until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the ointment is to be removed, and care is to be taken with a suitable ointment for that, until he is well.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the hemorrhoid is of the kind of knots of Strophulus, then cut it from above, as we have said in the section on Strophulas that are equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if a nerve is stretched out in this place so as to emit pus, then administer cautery to it, according to what we have said in that which is preceded.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Chapter On the section of a hemorrhoid that occurs because of an artery and a vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is interrupted and the skin that is above it becomes hardened, then often a hemorrhoid occurs from there; and also because of the veins, since they also cause hemorrhoids and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that a hemorrhoid and swelling are because of an artery and a vein, are these: for when a hemorrhoid is because of an artery, it is long and agregated in the depths of the body; and when you press the hemorrhoid with your fingers, you feel as if it were striding.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is because of a vein, is round in the manifest of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section on this hemorrhoid is an error, and above all because it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and around the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great and very painful.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that his care may be known by iron, and since it is also in the extremities or in the head, let it be known.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On this, therefore, that from them is from the expansion of the opening of the artery, find in the skin in length in a section.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with the hook, and then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce under it a point, and let it penetrate until another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place that is between the two ligaments with a hook, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and dissolve the hematoma.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure that generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then treat that with oils that are suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	That if there is a hematoma due to a section of vein, then you must hold your hand so that you can take it away from the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a point under the place that you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it remain in it a double thread, until you bring it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the hematoma with that good ligament: according to what I told you in the binding of a vein, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If, however, you are able to extract a thread, then introduce a point with another thread under the hematoma completely at the incision of the hook: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry up the hematoma from the middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then make an incision of the skin, and let go what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on that little flock that you immersed in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is done with oils and oils, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On the case of a torn nerve.
Caput L.	Chapter L. On the case of a torn nerve.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As happened to an artery or vein, so it happened with nerves: what has happened to them is perforation or has occurred from excessive work, and similar: and it is gray in the places of help, or calcaneal, and in all places where joints move: and it is a dull wound.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in multiple positions without pain: and when it is pressed with shaking, it feels in it a similar stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an aggregated wound in the depths of the body, but rather under the skin, and it itself moves all over, and does not emit to the front, or before, nor to the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	So what is the case with joints, it should not be injured with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, however, a contraction may happen.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is the case with the head, or forehead, find skin with a scalp.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is then a small dull wound, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then hang it by a hook, and scrape it off: then take it away, and join the wound with stitches: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the section of dull wounds, which occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI. On the section of dull wounds, which occurs
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people often have a lot of dull wounds in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, which they call "Fungii," because of the similarity of these to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of these is fine, and their heads are thick, and their lips are wide apart.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And they are some: and there is one that grows very much.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have already seen a man, and in his belly there were two Fungii, which were more like than other similar fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white, had small roots, and their lips were wide apart, and they ended, and moisture always ran from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So cut them and find in weight one as X and VIII uncia and in another almost VI uncia And the operation is to incision of them, then consider at that time, if infirmus is humid, and color thelil is albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: then incise it with a wide chisel, and let cauterization be present in you in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often blood is discharged from him at the incision; so if blood conquers you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see him weak and frightened from the incision with the iron, then take a twig made from lead badly done, and bind it to him with a thistle: Whose mode we have said, and let go of him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the constriction of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease to constrict lead, when it presses on the lil, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the lil is gross at the root, then in the incision there is some fear and trembling: especially because it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	But it is possible that you cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him so that he does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the wound, until the flesh is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suspect that you cut the lil which is of a dark color, has little sense, and an appetizing appearance: for it is an appetite-like cancer: and I will come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ Of the care of a prominent umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Head XXII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The برجسته umbilical can be caused by many things.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or out of the fissures of sphaig, which is over the belly: and comes out from it a little blood, or intestinal matter, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	From the windiness he cut off.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is due to a crack and the discharge is dirty: then its colour is like that of the body and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in different places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the escape of the intestine, then its position is with that which we have described, more severe in different places.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press with your fingers on the part hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it sounds much at the entrance to the sweat, and makes a noise when working.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to moisture, it is soft, then does not hide when pressed with your hand, and does not become tighter, and is not added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	That if it is due to blood, then with these signs an eschar appears to turn black from the crack.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to born flesh: then it is a grey, thick, hard eschar, and becomes solid according to the quantity of one unit.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is due to windiness, then the touch of it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is that you must refrain from curing it if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of an artery or vein or windiness.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and horror, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that eschar is due to an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	That if the eminence of the navel is due to intestine or bowels: then you should order the sick person to hold his breath and stand with his body stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then the signs with cauterisation around the navel throughout the whole body.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then with a smooth stone around the navel from side to side over the place you marked with cauterisation.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend half an eschar upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him firmly around with thread, or with a silk cord; and let the knot of the binding be placed on the lateral joint.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the median aperture, which is extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	But if you have already found him captured by the ligament: then remove the alenchatous, and introduce the index finger into him, and press the intestines toward the insides of the abdomen: but if you have found the hernia, then seize it with a hook, and cut off its surplus.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the opposite artery is for you, or young: then bind him around very much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then go back to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two akosi, and introduce into them two strong threads: and introduce two akosi around the one you have made around the hernia in the shape of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the hernia in four places around the akosi; and if there is a need, remove the akosi, and leave the place until the extended flesh rotten: and it will fall by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with the ointment that is needed, until he heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if there is an eminence of the navel out of flesh or out of moisture: then it is necessary that you make the hernia tight, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or the moisture which you have found in him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of him with the ointment that solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the cure for cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and as to how it is cured with medicines; and that it should be carefully guarded against cure with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have spoken of the caution to be taken in curing cancer that has grown in the mother.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	The old people say that sometimes cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: such as cancer in the breasts, or in the thigh, and similar places, from the body where it can all be removed: above all when it is starting to form.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is very old and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal from it anyone; nor did I see any other come to it who had healed from it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation, when it is situated as we have said, is, so to speak, ahead of you, and sometimes it heals the sick of black cholera.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then the bloodletting itself if it is evidently filled with blood.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with preparation, in which the operation is situated.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw on the cancer nails that belong to it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then wrap him up all over with flesh, according to the examination, until there remains none of his roots; and let the blood flow, and do not tear him off quickly, except that you express the places, and wipe away the gross blood with your hand, or with whatever means is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the opposite happens to you and the blood flows from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the man with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ On the cure of hidropsys.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already spoken at length about the division of hydropsys into its species, and how water is aggregated; also regarding the signs of each species, and the cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those who are cured with iron, there is only one kind of it; and it does not approach the iron of the temporal lobe: nor does it penetrate deep into the hyposarcomatous kind; for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of hydropsys with medicines and it has not responded to your treatment: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick person already has weakness, or there is another kind of weakness besides hydropsys; such as if he has a cough, or diarrhea and the like: then be careful not to treat him with iron: for that is a fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see a person with a vibrant virtue, and there is no illness other than hydrops: nor is he a child, nor an old man; then the mode of operation in him is that you lift up the sick man between your hands, and the minister behind him squeezes his hand, driving water to the lower part of the ribcage.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spathula-like spatula, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Set two acute parts, long, the acute end like a Spathula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, in him sits something that gradually widens, so that you do not intrude upon the intestine during the operation, and you let go of it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if it is a generation of hydrops from the part of the intestines, then you should extend it with a section three fingers wide from the navel directly to the lower side below the ribcage.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if it is a generation of hydrops due to liver illness: then your section should be three fingers wide from the navel on the left side.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen: then your section should be on the right side: and it should not also be that the section is on the side where you want to place the sick person, so that fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that section and squeeze with the Spathula, as if you were scraping it out: and let the quantity scraped be the size of a nail, or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the skin, until the Spathula reaches the dry spot: and there is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then pull out the person, and insert into the opening an instrument, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, round: and in its lower part there is a small opening, and on its sides there are three openings, two from one side, and one from the other side: and the end of it should be incised, following the pattern of a calamus, as you see: at its upper end there is an armlet.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument has reached the water, then at once it descended on the instrument; therefore I drain off from the water in an average quantity of time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you should drain off from it more than is proper, in an hour perhaps the sick one will die through the resolution of his animal spirit; or else something happens to him that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain off from it according to the strength of it, and according to what you indicate to you about the dispositions of sickness out of the pulse of its strength, and out of its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then take out the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it is retained immediately by the skin which retains the hole that is on the Sifac: of which I told you, that you do it according to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then go around the instrument with the other hand, if you see the sick one bearing up to it; and take out also from the water an average quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Make it on days a few without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there is not left in the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are over the sick one, and let go a lot of water: then guard the sick one with a grave in warm sand, and with a sweat a lot in a bath and in the sun, and wait for hunger: and guard the sick one with dried-up doctors, until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and the spar, and the spleen, after having drained off the water: following which I told you to do beforehand.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Of the care of infants that are born in places of their urinary channels not pierced.
Caput LV.	Head 51.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone comes out from the womb of his mother, and whose head is not pierced, or has a hole that is tight, or is not in its place:
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to help with the piercing of it immediately when it is born with a delicate thread and gently, according to this form:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put into the hole a tiny clamp made of lead, and tie it up: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	So when he wants to urinate, let him move away and stand up.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the wound.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you don't put lead on it, then it is possible that the urine which has run over the place does not allow the wound to close up.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he who has a tight anus, it is cured with lead as we have said, after many days, until it broadens up.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the anus is not in its place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from those who are born, the anus is at the end of the penis: so that he cannot urinate in front, until he raises his penis by hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation in him, therefore semen cannot reach the womb according to its straightness: and it is a foul disease very much.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of working in that is, that he should lie down on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his penis with your left hand by a sharp extension: like the cut of a calamus, or like you cut something, so that it comes to resemble the head of the penis: and let the anus fall into the middle as is required.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cause yourself not to have a flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Because that often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So he went with me when he cut off the blood, and looked after the wound until it healed up.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding the wounds that occur on the foreskin and the head of the penis, and discoloration, and adherentium.
Caput LVI.	Head
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These wounds often occur on the penis, and there is an abundance of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it another kind of evil is malicious, and another not malicious.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So you should hang the not malicious one with a small hook, and cut it off until you have removed all of it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on it an egg- yolk in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound afterwards with the oil of daphine, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	That if the albather be maligne and of a foul colour, then thou shalt administer to it after the incision a cautery and a rasion of itself.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the albather be caught in the foreskin and is not circumcised, and a part of it be within the foreskin and a part without: then thou shalt remove the albather that is within first, until when it hath been hardened, then care for the outside: for if thou hast cared for it at once, the foreskin is not secured save that it may be rent.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also there come into being on the testicles, and on the foreskin a blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Then thou shalt take care of all that which hath been darkened, and that which would corrupt, or hath already been corrupted:
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then put on a line over the wound after the said honey which is now bruised with flour of the coarse grater and herb of three-fold sifting.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, there come a flowing of blood: then administer to it a cautery with lunar cautery, after this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is of two dispositions at once, namely towards a flowing of blood, and towards a corruption when it is healed up:
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	That if it hath been corroded the head of the penis, and hath destroyed all in an hour: then thou shalt put into the meatus a canula of lead, that it may be vomit upon it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	But to the adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this kind of adhesion doth not come about, unless in that whose foreskin is sound, and is not required over it circumcision: and when soever comes about an adhesion on account of a wound or a swelling: then thou shalt cut away that by means of a dull Spatulium, until the ligames are loosed, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them carefully, then one should cut something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is, because the prepuce when it is thin, perhaps pierces quickly due to its slenderness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat with stiff wine until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	The purification of infants and the cure for errors due to accidents.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution to continence, as are the other wounds; nevertheless, since it is the result of our art, desire, and use in boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it a better operation, and a more gentle one leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I therefore say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books: for they do not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I have discovered more of the arts and phlebotomy for purification by circumcision with new instruments, and with forceps; and they use ligatures with thread, and incisions with nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have already tried all these methods, and I did not find a better purification than circumcision with forceps and a ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Since in purification by scalpel there often escapes skin.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the foreskin has two clothes; then perhaps one may be cut on the top, and it may be covered by the lower shirt; therefore one should consider cutting the other, and there will be pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with purification that is done by the finger, as the surgeon does, there is no security in the incision at the end of the male member; since perhaps it enters a hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the cleaning of a nail with a nail file, perhaps you've lost your way and ruined your work; and the skin of a child is by nature thin, and they are often born in this way so that they do not need to be cleaned: I have seen it already.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in the cleaning of a nail with a file, and with a thread and a knot, a good experiment has shown to me; for the files are proportional to the incision: because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When then you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportionate and work at the same time in one way; and a compression of the similar figure is formed, containing the skin of the wrist from all parts, with which there is no mistake at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of operation is its own, so that you can guess at it, especially if he is from those who understand a little, which you do not do unless you tie the thread in his wrist only: and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him be happy and rejoice in every way as much as possible for you, since he receives his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands which are prepared to sit, and not sitting down; and hide the files in your sleeve or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into his wrist, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the wrist leaves.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from that which clings to it in dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower part with a little bit of the second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger and keep the lower ligature in good grasp, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wipe the skin quickly upward, and remove the head of the wrist.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put on the powder from above: and over the powder a cloth in which the skin has been expanded, dried in water rose with good oil roscent: and leave it on itself until another day: and care for it with the remaining cure, until healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	But this is how the forceps are used for cleaning.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	But there shall be two ends to it, and they shall be set; let no clavus come into them: and the length of the two points shall be like the length of the two hands, equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a fall in cleaning is an error: for perhaps it escapes all the inner skin, or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you should stretch it out from your hand before the place is infected: and let it fall according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your finger, then take it out with a forceps and let it fall.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if they have passed over three days, and what is under the swelling has remained red, and the skin has been inflamed, then let it go until the heat of the apostema has subsided, and the rash has scarred easily, and let it fall according to how you have prepared it: and caulk your head from the top of the branch.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not hurt him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Care therefore for that with the powder which hardens the skin, which we have described in the book on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above the mark, and grows upward, it does not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Care therefore for that with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of the wryneck from the urethra.
Caput LVIII.	Head LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder, is caused from an inflammation made by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or meat born: and similar things which we have said under the division of cures.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	If the wound does not heal and you see that it is due to the stone which is now in the neck of the esophagus, then he should be laid on his side with his head lowered.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they should put his feet on his back and extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back and squeeze the weak person's breathing as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	So it is considered with the esophagus to expel the stone to the rear: why does Vrina heal?
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it doesn't heal with it as we have said, and the trouble is deep within the weak one: then you should administer the extraction with a tool, which is called a syringe, whose form is: made of silver, and be delicate, smooth, and fine like a feather's tube in its subtlety, long like the palm of a hand and half that length; and have a fine tube at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way out of Vrina through itself is that you take a double thread and tie it well at its end with wool or cotton: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut it with scissors if there is any excess from the wool, but insert it into the tube with care, as if it were lifting.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then dip the syringe in oil, or butter, and white of egg: and make the weak one sit on a chair, and insert the esophagus, and his thread with damp oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the thread with ease until it reaches the base of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it over above the navel part.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladder, and feel that the weak one has already come to the voiding place: and this does not happen according to this order unless the opening, in which you insert, is in the bend.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool slowly.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The wound follows the thread.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then, having cut away from the hair, and making the wound run along the way of the urine, and again tightening the skin and not ceasing to do this, until the bladder is emptied, and the relief of the pain is felt.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	¶ On the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Head 69.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a wound has occurred in the bladder, or blood has congealed within it, or pus is gathered therein, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then do with the instrument which is called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is silent, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And within it are three holes, two on one side and one on the other, like eyes.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the place of escape, in which is the thing that pushes out, without addition, until when it is drawn with it something, from the moisture is attracted: and when it is pushed out, away with it to a great distance: second, because it makes the clepsydra, which throws naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles of the war.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore the water is to be thrown into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw it along with that which pushes upward; for the moisture is drawn into the chamber of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the end of it into the penis, according to what we have said in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the moisture along with it which pushes: for the moisture immediately reaches the bladder, so that it is felt weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form of a thin clepsydra, whereby the bladder is to be cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass: whose head is higher than the rest, and under it a pocket between which a ligament hangs down.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a sheep, and place in it the moisture with which you are to cleanse the bladder:
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two sinuses with a strong knot with double thread: and apply to it a little moist heat over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the clamp into the penis, then grasp your hand over the urethra with moisture applied to tighten it, until the patient feels that sensation, which means that the moisture has reached the urethra.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you don't have a present urethra, then take hold of a piece of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it through from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those foramen, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then bring together the circle, as it is brought together also by oil: when you have put into it what you want of moisture, and oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind the thread into the instrument: and do with it as you did with the urethra by means of your hand, until the moisture has reached the urethra.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Regarding the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have already spoken at length on the classification of stones, and their treatment with medicines; and I have distinguished between a stone that is generated in the kidneys, and one in the bladder, and described its signs; and I have explained at some length the way in which operation is performed with the hand and section; and this is a stone that is properly generated in the bladder: and this is one that is formed in the urethra: and I am now narrating it with a clear and concise statement, and omitting nothing.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, then, that a stone generated in the bladder often occurs in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And of its signs is this, that the urine passes from the bladder like water in its transparency: and white sand appears in it; and it chafes the penis of the patient, and causes him pain, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises up, and passes with it the anus in many cases.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure is easy for boys so long as they do not attain the age of fourteen.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	It is difficult for the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	For youths it is medium (medium), because it lies between that which is large and that which is small; and if the stone be larger, the cure is easier; but if smaller, the cure is unavailing.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we proceed to the cure, first of all we must make the sick person defecate with a douche, that we may remove the whole dung that is in his intestines: for this sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone by examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken with his feet towards below, so that he may move to the lower parts: that the stone may go down into the rectum, or sometimes jump out from its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let him sit with his hands prepared between your hands, and his feet under his buttocks, so that the whole rectum may be drawn down towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in a space, then at once bring it forward with the cut above.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not come out under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the sick person is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full grown man: and let him insert himself in some part of his anus, and examine for the stone until it comes out under your finger: and turn him slowly towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and drive it towards the outside against the place where you want to make the section; and order one minister to press the rectum with his hand, and another minister to stretch out his testicles with his right hand upwards: and let him remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the section is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the probe, whose shape is as follows.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left side: and let the section be made across it so that the stone may come out easily from it; making the section from outside to inside wide, and narrow from within, according to the quantity which will permit the easy exit of the stone.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	The finger, which is in the anus and has been cut, is removed without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you should know that from the stone are the angles and edges, so it is difficult to remove because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round; and the exit of it is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So then those who have angles and edges, put them into a crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	That if it does not come out in this way, then one should use a device on top of it: or you should tie it with an awkward gesture, the tip being like the moon, which ties over the stone and does not slip off it: or as you put a thin tool under it, with a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot go on top, then slightly widen the hole.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	That if something hurts you from the blood, cut it off with a cut.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is more than one, then push into the first large hole of the anus.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little after it: and do the same if there are more than two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	That if it is very large, then ignorance is how to cut over the stone with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it has happened to a sick person of the two things, or that he dies, or because his urine distills frequently: soon, since the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer the expelling of it, until it comes out: or devices in the fracture with forceps, until you pull it out roughly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	But when you have finished your operation, then fill the urethra with thyme, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and tie it up, and put a wet cloth over it oil and wine, or rosewater, and cold water: so that the fever may be cooled.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then re-wrap the sick person around his neck, and do not separate the ligaments until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	And so when you have loosened him, embrace the place with water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then, care for the wound with unguent of dill and basil, until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if it happens that the wound swells hotly with added heat and rust, and has similar symptoms: as if blood congeals in a vein, and urine is forbidden to come out of it; and it is known from the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it incites to the corruption of the vein, and the decay of its substance.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt: and oppose to it any kind of thing that is fitting from the cure, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it should be during the hours of sleep, that two knees and joins are bent, because medicines laid on the place are taken up.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If it is a hard stone and sits in the meatus of the urine, and clogs it up, and prevents the exit of urine: then care for him with that which is fitting before you make a section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will excuse yourself from this cure, because I have already tried it out.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And is, that you take the chirurgical implement from the iron nail, whose this form is: a triangle, pointed, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind it with him under the stone so that he does not return to the vein.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the limb with ease, until it reaches the stone: and remove the Piercing iron from your hand slowly on it: and cover its piercing, until you make it pierce from one side to another.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	But urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on it that remains from the stone from the outside of the limb.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For he will break, and go out with urine, and heal the wounded one.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prohibits it from him: then tie the string under the stone, and a different string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut off above the stone on the same branch between two knots.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the knot and clean up the frozen blood that has formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to loosen the knot of the string under the stone, unless it returns to the wound: and the other string above, unless it returns when the stone is removed from above, to the skin at its place, and covers the bone, as we have said. For this reason you must tie the upper string so that the skin is raised above, so that it returns to your colleague, and covers the bone, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	As for removing stone from women's wombs:
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI:
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stone does not grow much in women's wombs.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if any of them has stone, then the treatment is difficult and prohibited for many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that the woman might be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is because you will not find a virgin woman who hides herself from a doctor when she is chaste, or one who has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is because you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hands.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is because it is far from the stone's location: for what reason it needs deep cutting, and there is fear in it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	That if necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a woman doctor who knows this well: and it is hard to find one.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you are concerned about this, then seek out a male doctor who is subtle and well-versed in the affairs of women, or a woman who has an interest in this art, part of it: so do this with her present, especially to him, that he may do all that you command him in the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, it is necessary that she [the woman] should look at whether she [the doctor] is a virgin: then it is necessary that she should introduce her finger into her vagina and feel for a stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If, however, it is found to be a stone: then she should wrap her hand with a cloth and, having placed her left hand on the woman's pubic region, should compress it firmly and ask about the stone, after which she should massage the area with her right hand and feel for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If, however, he finds a stone: then it is necessary that she should move it gradually from the urethra to the bottom with all her strength, until it reaches the root [of the urethra] at the base of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should wipe it dry at the point of opposition of the mid-urethra to the root [of the urethra] at the base of the pelvis, from whichever side it comes out, and feel for a stone in that part: and her finger should not be moved from the stone, being pressed down on it; and a small section should be cut off first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should introduce the ray [of light] over that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If, however, she feels a stone, then she should add to the first section an amount proportional to the quantity of stone that comes out of her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these there are some small ones, and big ones; some smooth and some rough, some long and some round, and some have branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You should therefore know the kind of stone, so that it may be shown to you in relation to what you wish to see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, blood makes you weak: then add a third of the quantity to the place where the stone has come out, and hold it for an hour, until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then turn your attention to your work again, until the stone has come out: and prepare yourself with the instruments I told you about for taking stones from the bladder, so that they may help you in your work.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If the blood doth flow from thee, and thou knowest that the blood comeeth out of the artery which is wounded: then put dust upon the place, and bind it with the dust of constriction as it goeth down; and change not that; but let the stone be loosed, and bring it not forth.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For peradventure the woman shall die of weakness.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then beware of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	But when the acuteness of the blood hath abated after days, and the place hath turned into decay: then thou shalt return to thy operation, until the stone be gone.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	As for the section over Hernias with water.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The ram's water is not, except that the aggregation of moisture in the sheep's skin contain one or more balls: and it is called a sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own pouch, which nature hath prepared for it in a part where it may be put: that is another thing, and it is the skin of the testicles between the sifacs, which we have said before: and this is not done but rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ram is of a weakness which hath happened to the testicles: wherefore this matter is spilled into them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it comes from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture hath many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or else it is the color of a russet, or of a crimson, or of a fawn, or of blackness, or of whiteness: and that which is more is called yellow.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs wherewith thou shalt know where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it be in a sheep' skin, which we have said before, then the apothecary is round of an even length like a ball: and the testicle doth not appear, because moisture containeth it from all parts.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there be moisture in its own pouch, then the apothecary is round with a part of itself, and therefore a man shall estimate it that it is another thing.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if there is moisture between the skin and the spermatic cord and white pus, then it falls down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When, therefore, you wish to know the colour of moisture, then experience the colour of moisture in the apartment with the square-shaped instrument, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, since it is moved out of the insertion, judge from that what is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we came to the cure with iron, then you should order the sick person, if it is possible, to bleed him, and you will see his body full of blood.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lie down on his back on a high object, and put many blankets under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side and order the assistant to sit on his right side, who will stretch his testicles towards one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the miraculum of the scrotum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to the chest: and make the section according to a straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white pus enclosing it; and examine it carefully, or be cautious about it, as you would cut it off: and sit your scarification so that it cuts off him from the side that hangs with an egg more: and scrutinize carefully with your scarification according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the white pus with a wide water-perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the section with a hook, and extend the white pus towards the upper part, and do not touch the skin of the testicles enclosing it: and cut the white pus in any way that is possible for you to cut it, either completely, or only partially, especially the side of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine carefully, there is no security in cutting it, except that water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the egg comes out of its skin at the time of your work: then when you have completed the section of the white pus, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then, two layers of skin are sewn together around the testes.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	After that, treat the wound like any other surgical wound, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If the testicle is damaged and has turned black, then the surgical wounds should be treated with care to prevent further blood loss.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testes along with its spermatic cord and remove the testicle; then treat it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If, however, water has accumulated on both sides, then you should know that there are two branches; so dry one half as you have done with the other half.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is even to you, so that there is only one operation, then do so; then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce a woollen cloth soaked in oil or rosin between the testes; and place another woollen cloth that you have soaked in wine and oil over the two testes, and press the testes together: and put a double cloth on top of them, and it should be smooth: and tie them together with a knot, which is sixfold according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and tie them together and fill them with carmine, according to this similarity: and let the ends that are pressed by the thongs or wet wool be placed on the back of the arms; and let all the ends be brought together with a knot at the hip: and let one end rest on some flesh until it reaches the spine, and the other end rest on the cheekbone: and let two ends rest on the two hips below, and let another end rest on the two genitals, and let all the ends be gathered together in a knot at the hip.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this awl is used with a caustic to cut the section of skin together with an iron tool: and it is like taking a fine scalpel and cutting away the skin of the testes; and it burns, according to what we have said: until such time as it turns yellow, and you take the caustic, in this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	And then pierce with that other sihac, and it is ignited, until all the moisture has gone out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	And then extend that sihac with a hook, and scrape with a thin knife on fire, and cut it as well as you can, until you have entirely removed it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And let the ovum not be touched by the fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you shall know that this operation is healthier, and further from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the opposite to you makes in the hour of section, or in the hour of cauterization with hot water, or a flow of blood, or something else: then you should do what the opposite does for you with the cure that is appropriate to it, according to what has been said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is shy and does not wait for this operation, because of its horror: then administer the piercing according to what I have told you above: and it is done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain of yourself with that which we have said about the signs, that the ramus is aqueous: then it is necessary that you should make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	And then pierce the apostema in the lower part of his body with a flat blade: and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and keep the opening wide, until all the water has run out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	And then place a cloth over the spot, and tie it on, and let him go away so that he can run off with the remaining water: and then care for the wound, until the sore is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if the opposite is for the exit of water in the hour when you pierce it: and that is not unless because of this, since the white cloth makes an opposite to the opening of a wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you should insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument from which water is drawn out, whose form precedes it: or add something to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns, and gathers after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it has gathered then it will return in the same way, and the sick will spend their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the Care of Ramicus Carnosus.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII. On the Care of Ramicus Carnosus.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in this section on Ramicus, it is from fear leading to harm in several disorders.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I leave him with a cure for salvation from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation in it, and the appearance of sores.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, that many sores occur on the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and it happens for various reasons, indeed.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute superfluity or bitterness, which is discharged onto the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the sore corresponds to the color of the body, and there is no sensation of pain: and the sore is gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a sore that is pale, whose color is dusky, and it has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And when it is from the swelling of arteries, and the inflammation of arterioles: as I have already remembered about it: or from the inflammation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That is, when it is from the swelling of arteries, it is known through the appearance of sores, when you squeeze it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which is from the inflammation of veins does not disperse anything from being compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is also possible that this appearance occurs on the section, and on other carnous parts: and it is as if it were separating the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand up, and remove it with a sifflet or a hook: and free the suspension from the water, and tie the bandage: and let the suspension rest after you have freed it from any part of the body.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then my bone is solid with those flesh-born [fleshly] bones, then you must draw my bone and strike it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between any of the [siphakets] or within one that lies between the [waa-sa]; then you must release all such adhesions and strike it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if the birth of flesh is in the place of an adhesion that lies behind: then you must strike all of it and draw my bone out, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When then your operation is complete, you must fill the bone with wool soaked in rose oil, and vinager; then take care of the whole [bone] with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	[On the Care of the Vinegar Tree, which is with the Grape Vine.]
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is useful to have an injection of a kind of vinegar in the swelling due to a soft and similar inflammation of the testicles; and it makes difficult the movement on foot and exercise and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this disease there is a fear because of its previous [remembrance]
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary for us to speak about the operation on her as it was done by the first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say that you should have the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down the suspenders of the testicles to the bottom.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles between your fingers and with those fingers that are near the scrotum: and let another person hold it and stretch it with a forceful movement.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then strike with a sharp chisel-shaped knife across the middle of the scrotum in a direct direction, until the skin is separated.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off all parts, as we have said to you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temporals.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in it a knot where there is a double thread, and tie the string in the first place where the grapes are: and tie the string again in the last place.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what has accumulated from the decayed and腐敗的湿氣。
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then take care of the wound with the cure for the remaining wounds, in which a healthy wound should be generated so that the clothes that nourish one testicle fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if all the wounds are affected by this, then they should remove it for this purpose from the testicles with water so that its nourishment is not kept back because of the incision and does not disappear or become scarred, and does not remain a wound with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Regarding the cure for intestinal worms.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV: On the Care for Ramicus Intestinalis.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The ramicus intestinalis should be removed from the section that occurs in the Sifach extent on the belly of the abdomen in the part of the groin from the inguinal channel outside the scrotum with a sharp blade.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come down from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the Sifach or from the extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two species arise from many causes: either from a blow, or from a fall, or from a noise, or from carrying a heavy object, and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign when it is from the extension of Sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is a swelling that is equal in depth: for the Sifach compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the section of Sifach, because it makes an immediate sharp pain at its beginning: and it is a swelling that differs in depth, appearing under the skin nearby; and this is due to the exit of the intestines, and their course towards the exterior of Sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with a wriggling intestine: and this is called Ramicus intestinalis, and wryneck; and sometimes it happens with a twitching.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes when waste matter runs into the intestines and is held there: and there is with it a great danger of death, because it brings on pain before hand, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And there is a fear in curing these ailments with iron: therefore one should guard against mishap in this.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is so that you instruct the sick person to bring his intestines by hand to the inside of their cavity, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he lays himself down on his back between your hands: and wash his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then spread the skin that follows the skin to the upper part, and dry the whole skin of the testes by its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix two sections of the skin between your lips, according to how it is opened by you: and the section be second according to the quantity, that it is possible for him to come out from it with a push.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then peel the skin off and that which is under the skin of the testes, until when he is detected to be white, firm from all side: then insert your finger of the index into it that follows the testicle, into it that is between the white skin, that is under the skin, and among the second skin, and break with him the adhesion which is in the back part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inside of the skin of the testes: and when you do this spread the white skin up, with your left hand: and wash the balls with the skin at the section: and order the minister that he should extend the balls up: and let him break the adhesion, which is behind.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ask your hands that there is nothing there from the intestines wrapped up in the white skin or hard skin.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if there is anything from it: then push him to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the acume, in which sits the gross thread, made of ten fils: and insert it among the rear section of the skin, that is under the skin of the testes that follows the section: then cut off the ends that emerge from the thread, until there are four fils.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then put together some of theirs over some with a figure which sits in the form of a cross: and bind them up with alsifach, about which we have spoken, because it is beneath the skin of the testicles binding strongly, until there can be no sending of any fluid that nourishes them to send to them something: so that nothing happens from that place of an apoplexy of heat.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put again a ligature second after the first one, far away from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures let go of alsifach, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, a quantity of the size of a finger: and cut off the whole remaining one according to its roundness, and take away one from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry out on the lower part of the skin of the testicles the slice, from which runs blood and pus: as we have told you before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool dipped in oil and put it on a peg: and administer the ligature which we have spoken about.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when, as well, alsifach is cauterized of the white stuff which we said, after cutting it with caution concerning the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligature until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if this delay happens in its fall, then boil it with warm water: and put over it that which we have spoken, until it falls by itself.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the peg with the rest of the healing of the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	[A note about ramie fabric]
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ramie there was no one who dared to heal it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that what happened in the ramie made with vine is like that which we have told you about in ramie that is with vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, so that the ligatures do not hurt after cutting on top of it with ease: and then dry out in the middle, and care afterwards for what opens it up, until the peg falls: and care for the peg, according to what we have spoken about, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Regarding the lacerations that occurred in the groin area.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII. On the wound in the groin region.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a tear occurs in the groin region, as we have said, and there is an exit, and nothing from the intestines comes down to the testicles: but if something does come down, it is a minor matter, and returns again at all times: truly, if this state of affairs continues for some time, a fissure forms in the sifach, until the intestines fall into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And what happens because of the lengthening of the sifach, which is in the groin region, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the sifach lengthens: then it softens, and the opening widens, and there is discharge.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with a poultice, as we have described in what precedes.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and that is, so that the sick person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry up the opening of the wound that has come to a head and is discharging, with a cut lengthwise, in accordance with the measure of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the sifach tightly, and what is beneath the skin, until it is discovered that the white matter that lies beneath the skin follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray, and place it on the opening of the wound from the sifac, and press it into the depths of the groin.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then provide two openings at either end of the ray from the sifac, and join them together with a stitch: then remove the ends of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the sifac at all, and do not tie one to another, nor anything else, as I have told you to know about treating the intestine branch.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then this cure for the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have cut the strands, clean it up, and restore the tendon, until it hardens.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The sifac is twisted, and no opening is added to the wound.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And a poultice is better in this place, for it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On softening the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles is softened in certain men, because the flesh that lies between them is softened, and its appearance is made ugly.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who asks for healing to lie down on his back, and to cover all of the softened skin with the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should sew together two lips and stitch them well; and if there is a lot of softened skin, first three stitches, or four, and a sturdy stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and let the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On castration:
Caput LXIX.	De Castratione.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated by our law; and because of this I shall remind myself not to recall it in my book here: and its reminder is not necessary unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is asked about it; and so that he may know how to treat it for him who has suffered this.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often lack castration of certain animals, for our benefits from them, such as rams, horses, and cats, and similar from animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by abrasion.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a slit and cut.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that one made by abrasion, the procedure is this: that we should make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and become loose, and then with your hand you should tighten them up until they are fully recovered and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by a slit and cut, you must hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of his testicles together.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the ligatures, and dry up all the openings with a single cut until both open; then cut them after you have scraped both of them so that there is no excess of the sinew, except for the thin skin, which is on the navel.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	This method of castration is better than that which is done by grinding: for grinding may leave something behind from the testicles, whereupon the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	The treatment for hermaphroditism has two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite is from the testicles according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The penis is theirs, because it appears to be a bulge, or on the skin of the testicles, in the space between the two testicles, in the form of a small female, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from it, from the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is only one member, and it is like a small penis on the skin of the pubis, prominent toward the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two are like the testicles of a man.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three kinds, the two from the male and one from the female, is this: for you must cut off the added flesh, until the impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of the remaining wounds in their cure.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second species of male, from which urine flows on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	The cutting of an inguinal hernia, and of flesh that protrudes in a woman's penis.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	An inguinal hernia may be added to the natural shape, until it is well and the appearance of it is improved: and sometimes it becomes so enlarged in certain women that it reaches up to the genitals, and extends as far as copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	You should therefore hold the tendiniz with your hand or with a hook and fall on it; do not make the last incision, especially in deep roots, so that blood does not flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself with care, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the middle part, that which is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills itself up; and perhaps it shall move towards the outside according to the similarity of its tail: and on account of this they call the first disease troubled by a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	You should therefore make an incision on it as we did on the tendon, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Regarding the treatment of a hernia in a woman that has not been pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratica is, whether it be a hernia in a woman that has not been pierced or a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is accidental from an illness that preceded it; and indeed it comes about either from born flesh added, or from a splinter of bone, or from splinters of wood: and it comes about either in the depths of the womb, or on its sides, or above it, or below it; and it prohibits coition and impregnation, and parturition, and perhaps it prohibits menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of this is acquired by observation during childbirth, if there is evident swelling nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then ask it with your fingers or with a ray.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the swelling is from a subtle splinter and is near two lips: then lean forward and clean it out.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place a sponge on two lips to clean them.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands at the same time and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force until the subtle splinter comes out, and open the swelling.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of cloth, and dip it in oil, and place it over the wound: and let a woman attend to it every day, so that the wound does not solidify with any other means.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the wound is very deep or thick: then it is necessary to remove it with a scissor-like instrument of similar width to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the wound is caused by putrid flesh: then hang it with a hook, and cut it: and have with you medicines that still the flow of blood without mordanting, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and also astringent with alum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then introduce a large tube of lead: so that the wound does not consolidate quickly; let it remain for several days: and then introduce an ointment of dried grass, and then cure with the remaining ointment, until healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when a child is conceived in the womb of its mother, the birth of flesh: it is necessary therefore that they be incised according to this mode: while there is no scurvous cancer; for which reason there should not be any contradiction with iron altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	For the cure of hemorrhoids, both the atehilell and the bohtor of the red rubor in any woman.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifices, so that much blood runs out regularly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore they begin to increase in size, then little worms are formed: and I have already spoken in the division of their kinds and signs; and I will now tell you which receive cure from them, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that the hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to be able to sense anything: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are in the opening of the womb above that which drops down a sense, these are the ones who are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you should introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the athenar with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then pulverize over them near the flow of blood from one pulverized cut without mortification: like acacia, and dragon's blood, and thistle, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push his feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put him in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persisted: then make her sit in a decution of sumach, and of corn-powder, and of gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take wheat flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it and put it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If, however, blood comes out with the plaster, it is good: and if not, make the back smooth with wool, and with daisies, without scarring.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of taraxum (or tarahon), or of arnica, or of willow twigs, namely, aglane, with wine from Pontus, and make it adhere to his back.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the plaster hardens, then take care of the place with ointment, until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is really similar to red caps and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It should be cut so that it appears like this, according to what I said in the text about cutting evenly: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Perforation from the womb which occurs in a woman.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Divers kinds of plasters occur in the womb, such as cancer, and a plastery, and ulcers, and blisters, and scabs, and sores, and blisters, and cold sores, and fistula, and hemorrhoids, and warts, and pimples, and a plastery heat.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all about these illnesses and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their cures, in a general way: it is necessary for me to say in this book about a plastery heat which occurs in the womb when it is caused by plasters that stick to the flesh, and how the opening of it with iron is to be made.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You should therefore reflect upon it.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	If the pain of his pustule is acute when he strikes it with his palm, and if there is a flame and fever, and you see it red: if he falls on it, then do not suit him with the perforation: and cure him with that as long as he lives, until when he rests, the acuity of the accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that she can rest, or lean her back, and spread her feet out towards the lower side of the leg: and let her legs be stretched out, and place her arms under her knees, and fasten them with a rope that suits it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and bring out the instrument with which she opens the opening of the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes to her who are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that you hold the womb tight when you administer this instrument, so that it does not enter more than the depth of the womb, and does not hurt the sick one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is larger than the depth, then it is necessary that you put a patch on the top of the depth, so as to prevent the entry of the whole instrument into the depth, and it is necessary that he puts the wheel that runs in the instrument from the upper side: and hold the instrument, and turn the wheel until the opening of the depth has opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it appears that the Exit is open, and touch it with your hand, and is soft and smooth: then you must separate it from its head with a flat blade.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus is discharged, then you must put a blade of oak that is dipped in rose oil: or in oily oil, in which there is some stinginess: and put it on, and extract a piece from the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on the womb, and on a woolen cloth that is dipped in water, in which are boiled bad eggs.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	After two days, apply the ointment suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the wound and the splint have been washed away so that it clogs with water and honey: then with water in which a root of lily or long aristocha has been boiled: then let it return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	That if the wound is hidden within the matrix, then it is necessary that you should prohibit its cure with iron, and also care for it itself with what we have said concerning division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Teaching on obstetrics, how embryos are treated by the womb, according to a non-natural exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first of all the figure of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs then, when you see a woman compressing herself towards the lower parts, and longs for air, and is relieved on her who is at the birth of the baby, and hurries in the exit of the baby: then know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and its exit is above her head, and second with it: or hanging, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, then let her compress her belly, that the baby may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended above her head, it has descended with it, and is purified from her with good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever this birth is, it is unnatural, unworthy of praise.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the baby has gone out on his feet, and the body of him goes before the head of it, and the feet and hands of him go one way or another: or the head of him and his hands: or the navel within: and perhaps turns over its neck, and other similar figures are unworthy of praise.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing you every figure from them, and how a baby's genius is in it, and what is signified by it, and shaking over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus has emerged from his mother's head by its own natural power, and he has made it heavy upon her, and difficult is her delivery, and her strength has already diminished: then make her sit on a chair, or let women support her: and with foenugraeque infusion, and with damp oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife shall insert her fingers into her vagina and find the baby with her second finger, and wipe it with her nail, until she catches what is there from the moisture: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus falls out.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not fall out, then the woman should be made to sit in a chair and be given a bath of foenugraeque with Sisam oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her to compress herself after the bath, and let her sneeze with a handkerchief, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	What if two hands of the fetus come out first? Then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not yield in the introduction, then put the woman on a chair, and raise her feet up: then turn the chair upside down: and let the woman hold on, so that she does not fall by the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then make the incisions, and remove the remains of the fetus: and tie her hand with a cloth, and pull it out with equality: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the fetus is on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on his feet, then it is necessary that you push them up: then gradually turn the fetus over: and then make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of his feet and stretch it out gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	But when they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress herself, and let her sneeze with a handkerchief: for she will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with it as we have said, then bring back the fetus little by little until you put it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will come out then on an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	That if it is prohibited with him all that we have said: then take from the mucilaginous of the aloe, and oil of sesame, and of the dissolved gum: and beat all in a mortar by good pounding: and then line with him the woman's loins, and the lower part of her womb.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she gets a fever.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	And when you see that his lower parts are now calmed down, then make her eat myrrh: and support him himself.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has held the sief for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and squeeze his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of his womb by easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For heat will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit of the fetus on its knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this form, then support by little by little putting your hands in.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will be raised on her neck, and her feet will hang down to the lower part: and she herself will lie on a bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then squeeze above his navel little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then take out what is under her feet from the palms, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	That if the fetus does not come out: then take his feet, and move them violently.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then squeeze what is above the womb little by little, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then put your hands in, and make the fetus even little by little: and tell the woman to compress, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	Exit of the fetus hanging from the arms.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He cut off his hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if he cannot reduce it, then let him free the woman, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk either, then let her lie on a bed; and strike her legs with a heavy blow.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she accepts this treatment, then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the hand to reduce it, and shape it according to the natural form: and let her sneeze, and order her to squeeze herself until she has exited.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with spread out hands, and it is turned towards the back of its mother's womb.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus by the hand, and then let her turn it little by little, and ease it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is even, then place it on a bed we have prepared from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move little by little.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then let her sit on a chair and order her to lean to the right.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to squeeze herself, and make her sneeze with condiments.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descended to the opening of the womb according to this manner with a second hand, then cut the second hand with your fingernail, until it has discharged from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it does not remain, and it dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus into the inside, until you place it: and order the woman to squeeze herself sometimes: for himself will come out from the exit lightly.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or a multiple fetus.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born: and sometimes they are born three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	Indeed this is unusual, and happens rarely.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	However, this is an extraordinary thing, and happens rarely: but they do not live alone: and there is a second one joined to them, although they increase in number: and they separate by a cord that runs between their navels, distinguishing them from each other.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes when they go out it is easy as one who goes out of natural birth, and they go out with a loud noise, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If any of them become difficult at birth and seek to go back into the womb, which we have spoken about in figures of nature, then take care of them as we have said: and let her sit quietly, and do what she does easily and slowly, and shape herself according to all the shapes with him that is preparing for his salvation, led by his skill.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	This reminds us that he is formed in the womb out of embryos and some are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	And sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and I have proved this with myself, that a woman has given birth to seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which is done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this needs to be put into the science of midwifery.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps, if it reaches that which is similar to it: then oppose it with it what is necessary:
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are concerned with a dead fetus and what I said about dividing it from midwifery, and it does not come out, and you force it to use an operation by hand, then you should reflect.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears harm to her health: then she should lie down on a bed, with her back towards the wall, and her head inclined downward, and have her minister hold her by her two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body is not extracted along with the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then wet the bone with oil and mucus of oak, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife wet her hand with these oils and mucus: then let her insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her ask where she should put the hook from the fetus, and the appropriate places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider this then, if the fetus is prepared to come down from above its head: then put the hooks into its eyes, or its throat, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its beard, or its chin, or its sides, and the places close to its ribs, and below its hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however it is going down towards its feet: then into the chest, and the middle part of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and put a loop on it that is between the fingers of her left hand: and let her insert it with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places we have mentioned, until she has finished the job.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then let her fix another hook opposite to it, or a third one, if she is able to: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not lean towards the side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with an equal length, and not just an extension in a straight line, but also let it move on all sides, so that the outlet is eased: as happens with a tooth when it is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that one which is between that: so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if any part of it is retained: then let the midwife put some oil on certain fingers, and insert them from one side, so that they rotate with them and hold what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus is going out: then swap the hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand goes forward before another, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of the contraction: then it should be put on a cloth.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then take it out until you can see the whole of it, cut it or in the joint of the plant, or in the bed: and so you should do with the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If, however, the head of the fetus is large, or it happens that he has a contraction during delivery, or there is water in his head: then you should insert between the fingers the thin sharp tool called Spatula, and drain the water with it as you take the head out, or cut off the head with the instrument called Almiscast: whose shape came from the same forms as the other tools mentioned above after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly do if the nature of the fetus is large head: then you should separate the hair: or take it out with a misdach, as we have said above.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head goes out and there is a contraction near the fork: then drain it until the water that is in the chest comes out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it is not complicated, and does not submit to the exit: then cut the head quickly, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the leg is swollen, or there is water in it: then you should pierce it, until the water comes out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If, however, the fetus is on top of his feet, then attracting him is easy, and his direction to the mother's mouth is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is contracted near the stomach, or the chest: then take it out with a cloth that you put on your hand: and drain the stomach or the chest, until what is in them comes out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, other members are removed, and then returns the head: then let the midwife put her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the jaw is open, then introduce your hand into its depth, and feel with it the head, and attract it with your fingers to the jaw: then introduce into it one hook, or two hooks, and attract it with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	That if the jaw is clamped, on account of the heat that happens to it: then it is not necessary for him to labor over it, but at that time it is necessary to administer an infusion of liquid things, thick: and to administer plaster: and to sit in water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	That if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible for him to adjust: then he should administer what we have said about the single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	That if that is not possible, then he should cut short, and extract it out.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary for you to leave nothing at all from the second inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about the hot apostemes that happen in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	That if blood comes out, then he should go down into the water of astringent, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she was impregnated on top of it with another fluid, and after a dead fetus was also born.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then happened to her after a long time an aposteme in her umbilicus, and it swelled, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to her cure, and I treated her at a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Then I placed on top of it some strong plasters of attraction: and she left the place of the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then there passed a few days for her, and she left the mouth out: then came out another mouth.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed from that place, where there is no mouth.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought, because there were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I examined the bone carefully and removed many bones, considering that the patient's condition was improving. It had been a long time since she had come, and the wound had almost healed.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not find this strange here, unless that it is a science and an aid to it, which the doctor-artisan performs with his own hands in curing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Regarding the forms of the instruments necessary for extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the description of the "Striror": This is below: the shape of the strior, which are equal in length, and two twigs are attached to each end of two boards.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this twig should be made slightly thinner than the strior: and to make it so, either from ebony or from hickory wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each board should be as wide as two fingers; and the edge of each of them is as wide as a finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two boards are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been fastened on both sides, whose length is the width of a palm and slightly more; and the width of each is as wide as two fingers or slightly less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother's womb so that they open up when you pull on the two twigs.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Description of the shape of the twig that opens the womb:
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, similar to it but thinner and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made from ebony or hickory wood, according to the similarity of a pair of tweezers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of each there are two additions as you see here above; and the length of each addition is as wide as a palm; and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	And when you want to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, hanging her feet down; and then open what is between her knees.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce two additional instruments joined together into the matrix; and you, holding the lower end of the instrument, place it between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you wish to achieve from the opening of the mother's mouth; until the Obstetrix does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form a spin which is different from what the ancient said Form the Impelling where the fetus is driven.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form a hook, with which the great head is turned: and it is attached to the forceps, whose teeth are on the end, as you see them.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is necessary to cut, as the forceps do in this form, as you see them, whose teeth are like razor blades, by which they cut and turn.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form a hook with which the small head is turned.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form the one who holds the hook.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form the one who holds two hooks.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of forceps whose teeth are like razor blades, by which the head of the fetus is turned.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form the one who holds two ends to cut the head off.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of two spatulimuses also bearers.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments all work, and the more they multiply in kind, and are prepared for use by the physician, it is faster in its work, and higher among people because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise these instruments, but have them ready.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For necessity excuses them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the second.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second is held back at childbirth, then you should use the lower ones to hold it back while keeping your breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze by holding in; and tightly place your hand on her nose, and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If she then leaves through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a staff, and pierce in the lid an opening; and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, rhubarb, anetium, chamomile, dill, cassia and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and mix them with water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then he sewed the skin around the hole of the ear, and the other end to the jaw-bone; and held it till the vapour had come to the solidification of the bone.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then he made him sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second time a great amount comes out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if after this treatment it remains stuck and does not come out: then you shall order the Obstetrician to dip his hand into oil of sesame, or mucilaginous althaea.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he shall insert it into the nose, and ask for the second time.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	But when he has found it, then he shall take it and gradually spread it open.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep into the bone, then he shall insert his hand, as we have described, until he finds the second time, and gradually pull it out straight, so that the bone does not break because of a sudden pull: but it should be changed by turning to the right and left with ease; then add oil to the amount of pull.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It itself then obeys and moves and gets rid of its adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the bone is contracted, as we have already described: take care of it with sneezing, and with medicine for the ear with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have said, then take care not to tire yourself out by repeated attempts at extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that, when it comes out to the jaw-bone from her, you should tie some threads to the sides of the jaw-bone.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then bind it with a ointment of four drugs.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For the matter will soon腐敗 it, and dissolve it, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it has rotted, a bad odour shall come out of it to the stomach and the head, and injures that member.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore it is necessary that suitable suffumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some have already been experienced in the suffumigation with nasturtium and dried fig.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument for suffumigation of a woman during retention of the second kind and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of a material similar to the corn and the other, and let it be placed over the fire; and the suffumigation shall be placed over plums, hold it until that suffumigation is consumed, and then another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the treatment of an unborn child not pierced.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their women have not been pierced by the needle of safar, which has now softened them with subtle smoke.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is therefore necessary that the midwife pierce with her finger that needle; and if she does not do so, let her pierce him herself with a sharp awl, and let her beware of touching her with the tail, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over him wool that has been soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with unguents until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you should happen to know that he has been drugged, then place a lead tube in the hole for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And also happened to the woman's drugging also from the congestion of the wound, or from pustules.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is therefore necessary that you remove that congestion, then treat him with what we have said regarding the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Regarding the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are due to nodulation and grossness which occur near the anus of the buttocks, or in the space of one of the members: and it is a single fistula, or multiple.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that nodulation becomes hardened, it opens, and there runs out of it moistness like water, white, or subtile pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when they are from these fistulas penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore those that penetrate are recognized because of that which is removed from the discharge, and the windiness, when a sick person uses the discharge: and perhaps removed from them is the windiness.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And are out of them Fistulae when they are in space penetrabie up to skin, and up to bone joint.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And are out of them Penetrables up to the connection of pelvis, and up to the knot of tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that which is recognized as Penetrant Fistula up to the member, and also from that which does not penetrate, it is, so that you introduce your finger of the index in the member: and introduce try subtilely in the Fistula of copper, or iron: when there is no tortuositas.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	That if in it is tortuositas, then introduce in it try of subtile copper, or feather from feathers of horses, until you feel trying, or a pin in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	That if you do not feel that one, and does not go out from any opening of discharge, and windiness, and skinlessness as I said: then you know, that it is non-penetrant: so you should approach to cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when Fistula is penetrabie up to the skin, or up to the meatus of urine: then meaning of it is a discharge of urine from it, and prevents it from that so that place with medicines hardens.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if is penetrabie up to the connection of pelvis, or up to the jaw of hip: then sign of it is, that penetrates try up there, if there is no tortuositas up to the jaw: and discovery of pain in the surroundings of part, and that discharge pus from it always: and that does not ooze in it medicine, and hardens with unguent.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these Fistulas all penetrant there is no cure at all: and cure of them is work and vanity for him, from stupid doctors, who form it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrant, and it is not old, there is hope of cure with sero: according to which I tell you, and already I have proved: and it is, so that sick person lies between your hands on his back: and clean the legs of him up to above hips, and hips of him are inclined towards wind of him.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert the lead or air, if it is in a curved fistula, until you know where the thread ends.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if he feels it weak about one of his limbs, then you should insert your finger index in the limb.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	But if you feel that the thread has already penetrated into yourself by feeling between your finger and the skin, or flesh: then you should know for sure that it has penetrated: so do not work on it, because it is not his cure, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	But they said that he heals in some people's flesh, and from the treatment by which he hoped for a cure, that is, as has preceded, to insert the brand of fine fire according to the width of the fistula, and to insert it in the fistula until it reaches a limb.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that again twice or three times until you know that all the added and filtered flesh that is similar to a feathered cane has dried up.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then this care with liniments of oil in butter until the flesh that comes out is dried up: and then this care with ointments that produce flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If he is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	But if not, then he does not heal with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the thread comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and is between it and the thread a thick flesh or skin: and you see a fistula running along the surface of the skin, then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and dry off with the thread that is in the fistula until the end of the thread reaches where it ends, and releases the thread and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh that resemble feathered cane, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if it wins blood, and dissolves between you and the operation, to separate those flesh: then it is better that it has happened, and quicker healing, cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Since the cautery, when it is gathered with fire, has good habits, it adds to the burning of their flesh, and to the cutting off of blood, and drying up of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then take care that it should be applied with linen wipers soaked in butter, or with torn rags, until the place has discharged pus, and the burnt flesh has come out.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then take care that it should be applied with ointments which solidify the flesh and make it hard: and there are remedies in which there is stenosis and drying up.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are being treated, then they are healed at once; and do not put off the treatment.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has penetrates to a deep place of the pelvis, and it is extended from the surplus of the body: then put your hand into it, and feel it with your fingers.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel a sort of tension between your hand and the fistula, or between flesh and bone, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation in it, unless after some time of hope and trust.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, because it is administered in him of two kinds: or, as we have said, either to cauterize itself, or to separate it, until you have the result of its concavity, that you may be able to put therin linen wipers, and cure from near.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the incision, lest you should fall upon a serpent which keeps a certain place, and happen to the departure of an ill-boding sickness without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care that it should be applied with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or, if you make it longer, and dry up the wound a little way from the anus, as we have said, or with tension, or with another acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then make clean those burnt flesh which are in the incision, as far as you can with care.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then take care that the healing of the whole wound should be with care, and that the solidification should be in its upper part: and there remains an open fistula in the interior part of the anus, and it will be looser than the ill-boding one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is followed in this way: that is, when you push a probe into it: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus; then seize the end of the probe that has been pushed through, which is like a needle's eye, that is, a small ring, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread coiled from five threads, and wrap it around.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce the probe with a thread into the fistula until you feel resistance.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it enters into the inner margin of the anus near, then extract the thread from that hole: so that you introduce your finger in the anus, and extract the end of the thread, and join both ends together: and tie them well, leaving them alone for a day or two: and as long as the thread comes into contact with the flesh, tie it firmly until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is healed and has hardened, and then cut off the excess, and then care for the wound until it heals over.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula does not penetrate: then let the thing penetrate in any way you prepare it for you, unless it is in the deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it will not be with you, that you make it by reason of a snake, lest you hurt yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed over.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the awl which the fistula is found, whose curve is sharp very much, and one side is not sharp, so that it does not strike that which is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from the cut of them: and care for the sores.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids according to two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are inside the anus, like coal, or prunes: or almost like grain of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from these are little and great; and blood runs out of them always, and is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the body, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But those that are outside the body are, for the most part, very few humors, from which runs the yellow water, or a little blood with constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure that is within the body is, as you order the sick to do so: and it is pressed out, until it comes out of the anus, and appears a yellow substance for you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore therefore hang them with a hook: or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them where they grow.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not hold hooks in them, because of their humidity and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a twig of pine, and draw them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and sprinkle some hot powder on them after the cut so that they stay in place for cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has gone before in the chapter of cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then heal them with the remaining healing, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not yield to exit, then use a small enema that will make it soft with the medicine inside it, so that it yields to exit quickly when it is emptied out with the disease.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the warts are external from the anus, then their treatment is easy and simple; and it is as if you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then heal them with that which I have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who hate to cut with iron, then you must administer a stitch to them according to this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread that is inwolved, and put it into the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then remove the tourniquet to the upper part, and make it penetrate with a sharp blade in the root of its other part: and tie the two extremities together by means of a thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them run transversely: and tighten the tourniquet strongly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot in the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Make it with all the tourniquets, and leave out one; and do not let your own blood flow from it, lest it should obstruct the wound.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over a cloth浸透在油中，或醋中，并把它放在上面；并指示病人躺下。
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then remove the poultice, until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the tourniquets have fallen off, take care of them with ointment, and with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	§ On the treatment of wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often both drying up and natural constriction occur.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they are a little dry, and do not respond to medicine: then it is necessary that you should cut them with the scalpel of Spatulimilus, or with your own nail, so that they may be moist, and the upper crust, which prevents them from being consolidated, may be taken off.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them, until they are consolidated, for you must do according to what is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then cut them again with a sharp instrument more than before, until they bleed much, and then take care of them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	§ On the cure of scalds and not of burns; and of dry and moist gangrenes, and of ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it is found throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and it causes pain on walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Then it is necessary that what is in the circle of the nail should be cut off, and held with pincers or a tongs, and rooted out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat that wound: and if you wish to cauterize it, do so according to what preceded in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the oil of the astringent one, the fine, rough, filtered, round substance that is on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often it happens in the hands of young people.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is, that you stretch the oil out and pour it on: or that you tighten it with silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize the wound with fire or sharp medicine: and already the oil that has been spread is removed, both the spread and not the spread with an instrument which I call a "spoon".
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	And the ant is also a small eminence, filtered, coarse, on the surface of the body, running into the depths vigorously: and when it comes to be cold, one feels in it a similar stinging of an ant, and it becomes throughout the body; and most of it is formed in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a tube from a goose feather or from a strong swan feather; and put this tube on the ant, until it contains a circle of the parts of the tube.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is around the ant; and put it in deep flesh, and remove the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with the tube of air or iron, according to this form:
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let it be above the limit, drawing a silent vaporization, so that the pressure of its grip on the finger is relieved and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what has been said above in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	About forms: Instruments which are used for poultices in animal ailments, and for the solution of the urine, and for the bowel.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a hot water enema is made from silver, or from copper and silver, or from alloyed brass, or hammered brass.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes when these instruments are small, and large ones according to those with which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	But that which is administered in the cure of small children, let it be small; and as for those who are weak or suffering, let the enemas be small also.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cane of the instrument, that is, the upper part in which it is tied to the uter, let it be wide according to this fashion: and let there be a separation so that it is tied as you see, and the lower end which enters into the anus, let it be dull, that is, closed, soft, violently, drawing towards subtility: and in one side of it there are two holes, and in the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the holes be according to the thickness of the roots, and the thickness of the roots let them be small, and let the uter in which the medicine is put be from a wet animal: or from paper, which is according to the form of an asp's head; whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let many holes be pierced through the holes as it is rolled up, and let there be a space which is the thickness of a finger between each hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those holes a strong filament from raw thread, which is made up of ten filaments, or something like that, and bind it with it so that it resembles an asp's head.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	But when the medicine is put into it, let it be drawn up in the cane between two separations with a strong compression.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then compress it with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the asphodel as it is depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the compression with it is this: that you fill the cane, or the uter, with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the nurse; and let it not be hot or cold violently.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person is laid on his back, and his legs are raised upward; and a blanket or a lint is placed under him.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then the extremity is smeared with oil, or with alum, or with mukilagine of fenugreek, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert yourself into the wound with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the assistant take both of his hands and squeeze him hard until all the pus has been drained from the pustule into the stool.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the poultice, and raise the sick person's legs toward the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine has had an effect, then hold him as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps all night with it on, it is more effective in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you poultice him during the course of a day, and his condition improves quickly: then change the poultice repeatedly until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful bumps in the anus, then apply a slight poultice of olive oil, beeswax, or mucilaginous fenugreek, and repeat this application until the bumps are healed.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a thin poultice on top of which there is a tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	The treatment of wounds to the head without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken about the treatment of wounds according to the book, and now I speak about the treatment with the hand, and with the aid of additional medicines.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, then, that wounds vary according to the nature of the wound, and according to the place where it is located.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Thus, wounds that are often caused by stones, or by the edge of a knife, or by a blow from a sword, or from a piece of wood, or from an arrow, and similar objects, are like wounds caused by a fall.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are located in different parts of the body are, however, like wounds that occur in different members: a wound on the head, or on the neck, or on the chest, or in the abdomen, or on the limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about some wounds, so that I may set forth reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin from simple head wounds; because the recall of the composers will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound has occurred in the head, and there is not a fracture of bone: then consider if it is from the impact of a stone, or similar, and already broken the skin only: and it is a great wound, and be wary of the outcome of the swelling of the heat: then approach and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay that: and draw out of it a second amount of blood according to its strength: if it should be prohibiting anything from phlebotomy, especially if it is the blood that comes out from the wound little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy take place from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person avoid drinking too much wine, or eating coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prohibits a little bit of restraint, then let him retreat from food, and do not approach meat, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if it happens that there is a warm swelling, a mixture of oil and rose water alone, or with wine in which there is stiffness.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are safe from the swelling of heat, then place over the wound if it is fresh with its own blood, and has not changed air, then I will tell you after a little while: and if it has already changed air, then place over it some ointment, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or is from an incision of a sword, and similar: and if its edges do not come together by their own will, then bring them together with a stitch, according to what I will tell you in wounds of the leg about the stitching of their edges.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, the wound has already been detected from a bone, and hangs down, and does not retain it, except in a little suspender: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the ulcer with medicines, and restore hard flesh to the site of the wound in the skin, and order the sick person to eat food in which there is gruel, such as are heads and cooked wheat, until it is healed like a pullet; and give them similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If the flesh is rotting on the skin, and does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the whole putrid flesh, and throw it away; then treat that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, these wounds contain an artery or a new blood vessel from which blood flows: and does not heal with medicine, then enquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If the wound is not healing when left open, then dry it with Spatem or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels while it does not grant what we have said, then cauterize it, until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then the treatment of them is easy and light: so that powder placed on them will hardend them before they change or move.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of Powder for the Incision of Wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of dried lime: mix them thoroughly together, and sift them; and fill the wound with this, and bind it tightly, until it adheres well to the flesh, and is healed with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it from above with powder, and leave it alone, and do not remove the binding until it has dried up; so that it does not ooze.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine will not drive it out, until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it has hardened by itself, for you do not have olive oil at present, and dragon' s blood also does the same operation in many large wounds when it is placed on them, and bound, and they are fresh wounds with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If I have already changed them with some alteration, especially when they are in the time of summer, then they are not in the position of this powder's intention: so take care of it with that which we said, so that you put on them some absorbed unguents: or put on them some puddings made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the remaining parts with the cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it really happens that there is a fracture in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with the gesture: and I have already said that the cure of fractures in the head will be in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	§ On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Head 75.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound happens in the neck, there is no difference in the cure between it and the wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a cut has already affected the nerve of the neck, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it except that it should be given the cure which makes a sharp rubbing, like a tar, and binding, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they are harmful to the nerves, and make them vibrate.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is a superior member: and let that which is cured be of the leach-ware, like calx boiled with water sometimes infused with oil, or with rosin oil, and thistle, when it is washed away also with sweet water: and also the mineral stones, according to this manner, and the absorbed unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then administer a stitch: or cover its lip with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wounds are deep, or have happened in a pit on the lower part of it, where pus has already accumulated: then pierce it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If the artery is already cut in the ulna and its blood flow continues: then separate, or dry it up, and bind it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the vertebra has been incised and the wound is healed in such a way that there is no risk of infection: then join the skin flaps with sutures above the canal of the vertebra, and do not touch the wound, but reduce it to its normal position.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the wound with a tight suture and let it go for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals without scarring or drying up.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the ulna has made an impression on the bone, then examine it: if there are any bone fragments, remove them all, or as many as you can; and if it is not prepared, leave it until the ulna rots, and separates, and the exit becomes loose.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the ulna is still fresh, then powder it with a powdery substance that it is made of.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if the ulna has been broken and a fistula has formed: then care for it with what is mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On the Ulna in Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LVIII. On the Ulna.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the stab is from a lance or a dagger: and if you can see its depth, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	But if the ulna is infected with gangrene, and a sickly breath comes from it, then know that the ulna is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is still fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it right away, nor tighten it up, so that the blood does not stay in its depth and go to the heart, and does not cause sickness: but put on it a attracting ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have ointment with you, then put a cloth soaked in water on the wound, so that it sucks out what comes from it because of humidity: and let the sick one sleep on the ulna, so that he runs to where it is gathered up.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed they had rested from their wounds for three days or more and no illness occurred, nor a spasm of the heart, nor a constriction in thirst, and his remaining dispositions are good: then you should know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	So take care of yourself and with care, and with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed his recovery is good, and his opening has been permanent, then you should know that he has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	So take care of it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a blade or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or on the back: then take care of it with what preceded it from sewing, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and it has come out of it with fragments: then ask about the wound, and approach to remove those fragments, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separate, then let them go, until the wound putsrefies, for their extraction is a relief.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But of the remaining wounds' accidents in the remaining member's judgment in the cure, is the judgment of that which I have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Regarding abdominal wounds and the exit of the bowels and their exit.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The break that happens in the belly is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	So from a great break, and whenever the bowel has come out, or the number of bowels.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why do they enter, and their sewing is more painful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small break also becomes difficult from another mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	So follow, that your introduction of it to its place does not immediately reduce it: for it swells, opens, and thickens: why is its entry difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason therefore a middle break is better than a great one: for if it were not difficult to reduce the bowel, as it is difficult in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the stitches of wounds are made according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common stitches meet together in a stitch of the eye, and in a stitch of the rest of the body's wounds; and two other stitches meet together in the remainder of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are more appropriate when stitch of the eye: and I tell you one as well as with exposure, and explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I therefore say that when the wound is small and it has come out of it some of the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is for one of the two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the laceration, as we have said: Or because there is an inflammation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When then that is so, then you should warm it up so that it immerses a sponge, or a damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you boil it in water with celery and spices and put it into it the intestine, until the inflammation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When then that is so, when the stenosis does make wine in which there is stipticitis: and it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When then you see that the inflammation has already been resolved, then wet the intestines with the water in which it has been boiled strongly, or dry it.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that it eases the entry of its own flesh.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If then the return of its own flesh is excused after this cure, then find little in the laceration with an instrument where hemorrhoids are attached.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than sectioning; and there is no coercion to cut after necessity and a lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	It is part of it one that is bent, sharp, and the other not-sharp, and its end not small with a sharpness of Scalamoris, but rather duller: and it is like a scabbard, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When then that is so, and the wound enters into the intestine, then it should be reduced by it according to its own natural form in its own place to itself alone, if it is possible over that: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When there is a wide disruption in the lower part of the womb: then you should place the sick person on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if there is a disruption in the upper part of the womb, then you should place the head and chest of the person higher than their lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise, if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the womb, then you should place your intention and always keep this in mind so that the part that is injured is higher than the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And in this way, you should handle those with large wounds and also those with medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In wounds that are small, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that the entire disruption is held between the hands of the surgeon: and spread open the lips of the person.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then note from him who follows after a stitch at a time: and this is the common way of stitching one wound.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is up to you to take as many stitches or as few stitches as appropriate for the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go of the extreme ends of the disruption by one finger's width, that is, the surgeon: and fix now one end beyond which you insert the thread in both ends of the skin, with two ends of the suture being under the skin from the inner ones, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already joined the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the suture: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie it with double thread from both sides simultaneously, sometimes using an awl: and join together the two lips of the wound as they come together.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the clumsiness of the finger as well, and fix another one: then make it straight with thread, just as you did with the needle first.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So therefore do not cease to perform this with the aid of the awl until you have completed the contraction of the wound completely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium thickness between thinness and bulkiness: for thin needles pierce flesh quickly: and bulky ones are hard to enter the skin; therefore it is fitting that they be of medium thickness in thinness and bulkiness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not fitting that the needle should be placed in both extremities of the skin close together: so that flesh is not quickly pierced, and does not open up a wound before its consolidation, and is also not stretched with the stitch, so that the wound does not go against consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the extremities of the needles so that they do not hurt the sick while he is asleep: and put cottonwools between their ends, which hold them in place; and let them go until you know that the wound is consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And these kinds of stitches with needles are much more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it is enough in the stitch of their needles that there be one, or two, or about them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common stitch is to join the four ends with a single stitch; two on one side of the skin and two on the other; and let the needle go round them all together, with a thread equal in thinness and bulkiness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you pierce with the needle all four ends, let it come from the side from which you began, so that the thread comes out from the top of the wound: so that there is a stitch as if it were a stitch of cloth that holds the cloth together; and put between each stitch a quantity of thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitch is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this kind of stitch I sewed up a man in his belly who had been cut with a knife, and the wound was as large as a palm: and out came from his bowels about two palms' distance from the middle of the navel, and there was rupture in the middle of the navel.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced it, after he had stood for 22 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The bone healed well in the space that had been there for about fifteen days; and I cured it, and it was healed; and after those days it lived a long time, prosperous in its disposition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there were no physicians.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I put on the bone a hot cloth twice a day, and I did the ablution of it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two kinds of sutures that I will call according to the narrative.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with sharp suture: and introduce it from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle enters into the skin, and goes into the lumen going according to the length and width of all the body: dismiss the end of the needle where you introduced it, and let it penetrate into the other end from the inside part to the outside on the other end, with a space.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this on the same end opposite from the outside part to the inside: and dismiss the end of the needle which is in that place, and let it penetrate into the other end with your own penetration, by which means you make it penetrate into the end opposite from the outside, and make the needle penetrate with your own penetration which makes it penetrate into the end opposite from the outside, and make it penetrate with your own penetration.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	And afterwards also from this same side opposite, and make it come out with the end which is out of the skin; and draw the needle out of the skin by which means you have made it penetrate into the other end.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	And afterwards also from this same side opposite, and make it come out with the end which is out of the skin; and draw the needle out of the skin by which means you have made it penetrate into the other end. And then reduce it in that skin, and make the end of the syringe opposite from the skin to touch with this end opposite; and draw it out of the skin where it was out, and let it go one way and the other: and make it go back after it, until its movement is outside altogether according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the summit of this suture, is as its suture of the skin: so that its thread one from a part, from one end of the skin; and leave it a thread the other side from another, until you complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of stitch, which is his own, as said Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This sentence, as he told, is such that his second type of stitch, like the way they are applied by some doctors, so that they collect all part to compare it with its fitting nature: and apply one end to another, and this end to another.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix this at the end of the cut, near you from the outside part, and let it penetrate into the inside alone; and leave two ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn around this cut, and let it penetrate from the outside part to the inside, in two ends of the thread; that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn around these two ends as well, and let them penetrate from the inside to the outside, to the two ends of the cut, which are on the opposite side; that is, in the back.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than a common easy stitch, and it is a stitch whose memory preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is then the word of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	Some said:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	Rectify the stitch of the foot with two nails.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, as you will, into both threads of one thread: and start with the insertion of the nail, from where it is in your side, and let it penetrate all the way to the other side, according to their stitch which is equal from the middle.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the break is in the middle of the foot: then this stitch is harder than that of the other places of the foot.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	But the judgment of treatment of the wound, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	When you have cut a fresh wound with its blood, before it is disturbed by air; and when you have reduced the intestines, and their contents, and made ready the wound; then put on the poultice.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already disturbed the wound; then put on over the wound some ointment that is present with you, until it forms pus; and let the yarn fall away, and let the patch be hardened, and fragrant.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this in the same way as the other wounds, until they are healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have present medicines with you; then put on over it at once, so that it may begin to emit pus, and change the wound [as it is] every day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you will not need other medicine when you have treated [the wound] with this, for many disorders; because it is simple medicine for wounds.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you are going to bandage a limb that is wounded in an important place; then dip the cloth into oil of average warmth, or rose oil; and put it on the wound; and wrap it around the parts between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or has punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens); then cleanse the wound with wine mixed with myrrh and a little warm water; above all, if putrefaction has already reached the intestines, and there is pus penetrating up to the skin.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what comes from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine called Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that has occurred in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, being from veins, and great size, and because of the lightness of its body, and the nearness of its nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the ulna is a bone, and you have found it recent: reduce it according to your reduction, as you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, the space has passed and it has been a while since the fracture, or it is dark: then you should tie it with a thread above the place that has become blackened so that blood does not flow out.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the bone there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the ulna outside the bone: so that it will ease your attraction to it, and its extraction at the top of the bone, and the emission of pus from the ulna.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembering the wound which happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the disruption happened in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, that, in some people, it can be restored: for I saw who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance thrust, and there was a bone broken on the right side of the stomach, and it was old: and a fistula was made, and it exuded from it, and windiness.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied the treatment, until I was not confident in his recovery: and I did not hesitate to examine it, until he was healed, and the place had hardened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place now consolidated, I was afraid of a bad accident happening to him in his abdomen: and that did not happen to him from that bad accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising in his walks.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimental people said, for when it happened in the intestine, and it is small: then it should be tied according to this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, so that you do not get big ants' heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then aggregate the two lips of the ulna, and place one ant from them which has an open mouth over the two lips of the ulna.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So he cut above it and bound his mouth, because it was adhering and not loosing.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant next to the first one, and do not stop doing this with the ants after the amount of wound of the whole body.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the patient's wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For these heads that remain attached to the Intestines, until they are joined with the Intestines, so that they heal and do not cause harm to the whole body.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is also possible that the intestines be tied together with a thin thread: which is torn out of the animal's intestine and attached to it once it enters the bag.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And so take the end of this thread from the intestine, and cut off a lot of flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie on the end of this thread with a thin thread wrapped around it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the bag, and bind the intestines together with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the patient' s wound in dislocation.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is not more than a second time of faith and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that the wound which is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then it is not a cleverness but an ordeal, and its healing is not at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the care for Zuchamen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head 78.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or ulcer when it ages and grows old, becomes a sore, does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then we call it universally a fistula wherever it is in any member: and we name this itself Zuchamen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is according to the severity of the bump filtered out, hard, white: with which there is no pain, whose feathers are bent forward: and because of it some call it Risatus, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And so it splits in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this moisture is much, and is little; and is thick, and is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already preceded in the division; when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal, and is born in it flesh, is not that except for a new cause of causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either through scarcity of blood in the body: or through evil of its nature: or because between it and on its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh: or because it is full of dirt and filthiness: or because the wound is putrid within itself, and the material that is cast out from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inappropriate in its cure: or because the decay of a fall is in the region, as happened in Caesaraugusta: where it is difficult to digest diseases, and the healing of aphemia by nature is delayed: or because in it there is one jaw, or the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all the stations of causes and signs, and cures with medicines in a division; and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuchens, which is done by means of an operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	So you know, that a Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are Fistulas that reach to great veins and nerves, or to a sinus: or to an intestine, or to the urinary bladder, or to some member of the backbone: or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some joint of compound joints: like hands and feet: and from them are those that reach to the proximity of the main member, and similar.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which therefore of these Fistulas is difficult of healing, and does not receive cure, and work is occupation with it, and ignorance. De his autem praecipue, quae ad uenas arterias et nervos accidunt, in quibus, si non uti possis, neque iaculum uti potes, neque uale, illuc cum manu ostendi: si enim illuc manu ostenderem,
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from the fistulas any depth does not reach these places that I said: and you hope, and trust to its cure, and see to come to its knowledge, then take a trial from air, or iron, if the fistula extends according to straightness, and inquire of it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is any twist in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For because of the lead with its gentleness, and it cures about the twists.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the fistula is having many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate on it with a lead.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So take a clister from them from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For because of the moisture that the clisterizans takes it, runs against other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire afterwards according to how it is possible for you: that you know what there is an opening, or a nerve, and whether the fistula is long or near: or is a fistula with many openings, and is over all that, with your great strength: with your interrogation, by which you interrogate the sick, and discovery of pain on compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causal factors are separated.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stand still on all those stations with true station: then go to cure according to your confidence: and is, when you consider then, if it is a near fistula appearing, or in a healthy place far from the joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I said to you: then dry up the fistula according to what has been stated before in my narration, and remove whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which comes out through its opening from the flesh, or a thread, and similar things: and cure it, until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of a long depth, and extends according to straightness: then it is necessary that you separate it in the depth as far as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it with all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then add the lye, dissolved in acute medicines, and insert it up to the point of the fistula which you have grasped with iron: make this several times, until the acute medicine has corroded all that remained in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointment which generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal through this, then cauterize it according to what we have related.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is an opening, and you can confirm this for yourself: then examine it, and dry it up according to what I have told you: if it does not prevent you from doing anything, either by a vein, or a nerve, or with a main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If it is discovered for you that there is an opening and there is some corruption and blackening therein: then shave it, until all the corruption has been removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the flesh with that which causes it to grow healthy, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and it spits out pus as it did before: then know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	So examine it a second time, and feel whether it has grown firmer, and clean it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals well, then that is good: and if not, then know that the corruption is in a distant part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is not therefore within your skill to do so, unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the corruption is in a small opening, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle hooks which are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then feel whether they are attracted to all of them, and do not leave anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something repels you from any of them because of moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting into them: then cut into the moist parts and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you are not prepared to remove the bones from your hour, then place them on the limb that will rot first; and release them until they rot as they are surrounded by flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the limb so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the section that you have followed in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Then place on the bone, if needed, three times soaked in sulfur with oil: or once soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some kind of ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those [humidities] putrefy, if they separate from the bones, then the removal is relieved and their attraction is attracted away.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is one large bone, such as a femur or pelvis, and that which has corrupted it is a large part, then shave it with the last rasp until it is removed [from the body] black and corrupted.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut into it completely up to the place where the corruption has taken hold: then care for it, until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you the story of a man who happened to have a leg [injured]. So that you may place it as an example and an aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom there came a pain in his leg, from within the body, that is, from the inside, until it reached the flesh, and caused a great ulcer; and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So he stayed for a time with the mistake of the doctors, until it opened up [the ulcer], and many materials entered with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed until his leg had been bound up, and many openings were made in it: all of which gave off pus and the flesh's moisture.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	For a considerable time an multitudine of physicians had been around for about two years, and there was not a wise man in the art of the hand until I was called up, and saw his leg, and the materials that came out of those orifices went with great speed: moreover, all the body of a man was now laid open, and the color of him was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I entered one of the holes, and it came to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I scrutinized all the holes, and I found them coming together at one place from all sides of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	So I held on and followed one of the holes, until I detected a part of the bone: and I found it decayed: which was already decayed, withered away, rotted, and penetrated through to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	So I cut off what had been detected by me, and prepared it from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I cut away what was not in the bone but that corruption, which I cut off and also cut through.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had now cut it out entirely.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I laid the wound open with medicine that was consolidated well over a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	But it wasn't consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and found on the bone below the first detection: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and also cut off what seemed to me to be also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	But it wasn't restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I detected on the leg again, and didn't stop striking the bone in detail, and tried to restore it: but it wasn't restored until I struck out of the bone about a hand's width, and I took it out with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and this recurrence in the operation, and sectioning of it, wasn't necessary because of the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear for it from death: for it happened to him at all times from a bad syncopus discharge.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was healed by a complete healing; he was born with a hard bone in the place of the spine, and his body was well arranged, and his strength returned to him; he was accustomed to his limbs; and he did not suffer any harm from walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the jaw is broken at a point where it has already been fractured: then you should fix it like this: take a strip of skin, and tighten it at the end of the prominent bone; and order someone to stretch the jaw upwards: and put another thicker strip of skin over the first strap.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh that is above the bone; and stretch out the end of it so as to pull the flesh downwards: and you should cover the place where you want to tighten it with skin, so that it does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a strip of wood or a board under the bone from below; for when you do this, it does not hurt the corroded flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be fixed over the corrupted place just a little so that the corruption of the bone does not show in its appearance; and does not give an impression of being loose in its own strength, and press against another piece of wood.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the jaw is corrupted and does not protrude, then a part of it continues with another part; corruption is in the middle of it, or in one part of it: then you should cover all the flesh with its own skin.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood beneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then fix that from the first part where there is corruption until it continues with the second part of the wood; and let the fixing be of the same length as the corruption, as I have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, then cut off that joint, and fix the jaw where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints: then there is no strength in that except for a wound.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the hand or foot joint: then the work is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is necessary for you to inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And then scrape it off, and wash it out thoroughly according to whatever disposition you find possible for it, and with whatever wit is right for you: when it does not make a contrary Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many tools and saws for cutting these bones, depending on the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and fineness, and their size and purity, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for all kinds of operations.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations require a long study when you are holding the instrument in your hand.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And understanding the methods of this art will be a witness to the methods of diseases: then you will already find, through yourself, what is suitable for him from instruments, for every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments, which you place as examples over what you cut, and proof of what you experience on others.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of a different saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of a different saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the saw, drawn out slightly to one side.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its bow be made higher, its sharpness from iron: and its handle from beech, and let it be made with a slightly off-center pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of the razor, joined together.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be shaped according to the form of a star-shaped claw: and its edges be shaped according to the form of dots made by the elephant's foot.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless they are joined with heads of razor blades, when they become dull, or a wide and large mouth; and its width is great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of a medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of the blade-edge.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape is concave.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of the other edge is thin.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of the other edge is curved at its end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The blade shape is thin and delicate.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of the blade with which bones are incised.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape of the other large blade.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a radio and the end is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places from the incision of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of the blade that corresponds to its incision which has been made through the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, and its ends are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	It fits from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of the blades, and incisions, and saws, should be.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the incising of bones and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrify, or for an extrinsic cause, or an intrinsic one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	But when the patient was cured by the application of medicines, and there is no cure for the corruption: and you see that corruption incises in the limb, where it does not give any sign: then you should cut into that limb as far as the place where the corruption follows, so that the patient may be saved by that limb from death, or from a greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign where that takes place is that the limb is discolored until it is cured: that fire burns it, or it putsrefies after nigridine: until it incises putrefaction as far as that limb which follows it, and it seizes in the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Thus when there is proper incising with it, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from some percussion of certain venenosos: such as the marine scorpion, and the horse-fly, and the gnat, and others.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore corruption, or percussion is in the end of a finger, then cut that finger, and do not allow space for corruption to spread, so that it incises as far as the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root quickly, and do not leave space for corruption, until it reaches the powerful arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has entered into it, then cut the arm at the shoulder joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption has passed and you see it around the hip: then death is certain in that place.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And besides this cure, there is a quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do with the foot, when corruption enters into a toe, then cut it at the joint: and if it enters into the shoe, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it has risen up to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if corruption has already reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to amputate and leave the patient to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to cut a member off, or to bend it, is so that you tense the ligaments below, which you wish to cut: and tense another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one minister of the ligaments extend to the lower: and let another minister of the ligaments extend upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you shall separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a chisel, until all the flesh is seen.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut it, or bend it.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And you shall place a sheet of linen before all the parts, so that the saw does not touch the sound place: and let happen to the sick person an addition of scar, and of swollen heat.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if blood comes out from within while you are working, then quickly causticate the place: or put on some powder to stop the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then go back to your own medicine, until it is finished.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a suitable ligament, and take care of it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I told you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is, because it happened in his black foot, when the ash that is absorbed is like the combustion of fire; and that corruption first happened in his finger, until he began his whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Then the man recovered from his swelling, after he saw the corruption enter into his limb with its pain, which he felt and its dryness; and it entered himself at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after he had passed a long time, that corruption again happened to him in the same way in his finger of his right hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with him when I put on the hand with the medicines after the purification of his body: and the superfluity did not respond, and began to enter into another finger; until it began corruption in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me then to cut his hand off: and I would not do it, hoping from me about the response of that superfluity: and I was afraid also about him at the cutting off of his hand death.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the strength of the man was over his falling.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Then when he was disappointed from me, he returned to his land: and came to me about it, for he desired to recover, and cut off all his hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this story, except that it might be a help about what falls of this kind of disease: and that it might show, according to when it happens.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the cure of sores, and the quality of clogging with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 80.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When it happens that a sore is on some fleshy member, and its space is prolonged, until it forms a clump of pus: then it breaks, or pierces, and what is in it is discharged out, leaving behind an empty place like a wound, and the skin over it as thin fabric: and does not spread to the final corruption of its disease, nor prints into the mouth, nor the nerves, nor the ligaments: it deserves to be called a sore: but if it prolongs its space, until it impresses the corruption on some of these members, then it is called a fistula, or a tubercle.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And his cure is that you should strike off the whole skin as it peelings: and above all when it has thinned, and made like a cloth: and trust that it will not stick to the place because of its decay.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and not lead to such corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh on it, then your cure with Clister is this: and it is as if you consider it towards the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor: then your cure with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and myrrh, parts equal, gathered together in a jar: and boiled over fire, until it turns red with the medicine: and comes to a thickness like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it whatever you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and your cure with Clister put in it: and tightly close the opening, and let the medicine flow into it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with an expression: do this for days, until the sinuses are cleared and the foul odor is gone away.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when your cure is made with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and it is as if you take the ash of oak wood, or the ash from oak trees: and throw it on the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then stir it, and your cure with it, until you trust that the sinuses are now washed away.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the tolerance to Egyptian medicine or water of ash is not good, then your cure with water and honey, in which there is also some crushed myrrh.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or your cure with honey and wine mixed, because of the property of honey is to cleanse and wash away: and the wine makes the sinuses adhere, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	How often you do that and be confident that the corruption of the sinus is now far away: then let him make him a clister with what he does, to give birth to flesh in him.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And is, so that you take from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve him with olive oil, and wine stypical: or let him make himself a clister with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the orifice of the sinus is strict, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then increase it with iron a little: or put in him licorium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, or in unguento basilicon, until it is increased.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And likewise if the orifice is also wide, then aggregate the lips with a suture: and let him go out of it a quantity in which to be added to the clister without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise if the orifice from which the pus runs is raised higher: then dry him in a lower place that is in him, so that the pus runs out of it down: for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if you do not find it possible to dry the sinus all around lower than it is, according to what you want: then strive, so that you prepare the member with which the pus runs out of it with ease according to which you prepare it for yourself.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Strive, so that nothing of the pus remains in it at all: and take medicines consolidatıves which are placed on the mark, fitting for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And have a cloth of such a quantity that it comes into contact with all of the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps in the direct orifice of the sinus hole, a little wider orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the ointment with soft brushes over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and put it on him in a position distant from the orifice of the sinus, so that the exit of the pus is facilitated: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after some days take off one edge.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But he who is above the sinus opening, that is whom you move at all times, so that he emerges from it what is gathered in him from pus; and so that you know, that which runs out of it virus, is much or little: or digested or indigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself, that does the lord feel pain or not be in it pain, and if it is in it a swelling or not be in it a swelling.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Now when your medication is extended thus, and you see the material that emerges above the sinus opening, then know that the sinus has already adhering, or is approaching adhesion of the scar; then therefore solve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth to another, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if it emerges from the sinus after a long interval subtile virus, then do not despair of the adhesion of it, because the cure of it approaches, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act in the opposite way to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it emerges from the sinus after many days pus undigested, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its duration is prolonged: then add to the drying of medicines, truly let the doctors make them so that they are in their substance humid, and in their virtue dry: like the unguent of daphnicum, when it is added to it in abundance of addition from zeki.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And at the very last when it is cured, that you take the unguent of daphnicum, and dissolve it with rose oil, and rub it on the old wound to equal substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then prepare the wound with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action does, when you do not have present to you the unguent of daphnicum, honey, when you heat it up, until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh and aloe and incense; let them all be mixed together and powder and spread it on honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then bind the cloth over the wound and tie it around the sinew: and bind the cloth with the honey you have prepared until it thickens: and sprinkle the powder on the wound, and bind it to the cloth, and tie it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes when it is administered in him long aristolochia, and roots of lily of the sky, and there is a lily: and flour of grass, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or mixed, knead it, and sift the powder over the honey you have prepared, and use that.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	That if the matter of the sinew is prolonged, and does not heal with this cure: then you shall know that there is corruption in it: or it already has made an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then cure that member with fistulas, according to what has been said.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the cure of a finger that is swollen and rubbed with ointment, and an incision in the finger added, and cutting it off.
Caput XCI.	Chapter LXI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is an inflammation that arises under the nail of the thumb or of any other finger.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the matter of it is prolonged, and neglected in its cure, and turns into an abscess that discharges pus, until it corrupts the nail root: and perhaps corrupts all of it, and perhaps reaches the jaw, until there is a foul odor from it: and makes the end of the finger swollen, and blackens its color.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you cure that member with the method we have mentioned above, and your cure does not succeed: then you must cut away all the excess that remains under the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the finger after it.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Because the cauterization of the injured is very hot.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	But if the jaw is sound, and the nail also is healthy, and the addition of the nail begins to press on the flesh toward the inside, and begins to prick it, then you should place a very fine lead under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up: and cut the flesh easily, and place over it what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, and corrosives, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then this cure with the ointment, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption has already set deep into the bone, then it is necessary that you break that bone and take it out: for it does not heal at all while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the corruption and the corrosion penetrating into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what was said above as a reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then heal that person, until he heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if there is a pain due to the fingernail being torn or struck; and it begins to ache acutely, then first of all you should drain the blood from the wound.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across from above to the nail.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard it, so that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail; for you will bring about an extremely painful pain in him, and it will be a cause of birth of flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then heal the place with this while he sits; for he will suffer from great pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger, however, that is added on some of the hands of men, perhaps is all flesh; and perhaps there are bones in it, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and perhaps its birth is in the joint of the hand or in any other part of it.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	This one who is born in some joints of the fingers does not move; and this one who is born near to the joint of the finger may be moved.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	But this flesh that is added on some of them is easily cut.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, to cut it with a flat spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the healing of that one whose birth is in the joint of the hand is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	So then, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in that one who is born in the finger up to its last joint, then it is necessary that you cut off its first flesh with a round knife up to the nail.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then cut the bone with one of those saws suitable for cutting bones to that end.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the fusion that occurs between the fingers often happens many times, or from birth in man, that is, he is born with it, or from bone injury, or fireburn, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to separate this fusion, until the fingers recover their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a piece of lindenwood or cloth dipped in rosin oil: so that they do not quickly heal and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the place heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise, if the fusion occurs in some of the fingers with the palm, then dry out that fusion, according to how it is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Regarding the Incision: The fault is not in those who translate, but in those who are unable
Caput XCII.	Chapter LII. On Wounds
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins that are swollen, large, and full of melancholy fluid occur in many parts of the body; and most often they occur in the legs, especially in those who walk or work a lot, or who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to provide strong treatment with some form of incisions and drainage for the body from black cholera.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, draw blood from the patient with a basin-shaped cup.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of these wounds with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they should rest, and the black blood should be drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that a vein should be raised, and all the blood should be drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	But the incising of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Whip the leg first with hot water a lot, until the thick, putrid blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the leg tightly by the nurse from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with strips, and tie it up with strips.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the wound in one, two, or three sections with a wide piece of cloth.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then wash, that is, wipe away the blood from the lower part of the leg with your hand until it reaches the top and from the upper part let it run into the bowl; because the sick should first be bled from above.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the wound with a cloth down to below; until he has gone out of the blood as much as you see is sufficient and what the strength of the sick bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it up; and order him not to have any food that generates black bile: and again let there be an evacuation and a bleeding when the veins are filled, and this pain the sick man.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	But the elevation is to be made in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the sick if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put him into a bath: or wrap him up in the leg with warm water until it turns red, and the veins swell; or he exercises strongly if there is no bath present, until he warms the limb.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in one straight piece of cloth along the length of it; or at the end of it near the knee, or in the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook and scrape away the wound from every part, until you can feel it; and that is the appearance of it, which you see turns red into blackness by its falling.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	But when you have taken off the skin, you will see it white as a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then put beneath it a razor, until when it is washed away and has gone out from the skin: hang it up with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another piece of cloth close to that piece of cloth with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin off from the upper part of the leg, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then wash it with razors as you have done, and hang it up with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut off another section, or multiple sections, if you are able to.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then wipe it clean, and make the incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And make that, until you remove it from the upper section, or higher sections, until it is completely removed: then make the incision.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you when you try to remove and clean it: then insert a strong double thread into it, and tie it, and remove it: or insert Radium under it: and withdraw your hand from all parts until it is removed.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful, so that it does not get cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to remove it deeply, and it will enter into the sick part, causing harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you completely remove it: then place it on the spot that is sore, soaked in wine and oil, or just oil: and care for it, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	Which if it is contracted, having a curvature to which there is an angle of inclination, and not as we said according to the straight line: then you must find out over all its parts, and the locations of its contraction.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it with a hook, until you clean it all over: and be careful at the section above your hook, so that you do not cut yourself on it, or make yourself sore: for it will be difficult to clean you if you hang it on you, or remove it from you.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	So then be careful with your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the wound when the wine heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not a curvature like the rest of the hook, and there is no acute extremity, so it does not sore the skin: and it has a blunt flexibility, gentle: for if it were subtle, it would cut the skin with its subtlety: but it has excess thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the venous blood from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter LIII on the Head.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is found in the legs on warm ground, such as in Al-Jaziya and Arabia, and on dry, hot ground with little vegetation, that is, where no herbs or trees grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its origin is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and how vermin are generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the inception of this vein is a severe inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area becomes swollen.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the area of swelling, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When this end of it appears, then you should wrap a piece of lead around it, whose weight is from two to three drachmas, up to five drachmas, and fix it in place: and remove the lead from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	As often as anything moves out of it towards the outside, wrap it in lead and mark it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged for a long time, then cut off a portion of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut off its root until it has completely emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut into it, it will contract and penetrate into the flesh; and it causes pustules to form, putrefaction in the place, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently, and extracted slowly, until it has completely emerged from its root, and nothing of it remains in the body: and this vein emerges from certain people at a length of five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has reached me, for it has emerged from a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if you are injured during your treatment: then insert a ray into its openings and pierce it with the ray, with the body, until all that is inside it has drained out of it, and administer decay to the site with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then the care of him is to cure the sores.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And these [veins] sometimes have many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings are present in it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore care for him, as we have said in the division, and with what has been stated above.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the section on worms that are born under the skin, and it is called a sore plague.
Caput XCIIII.	Head 84.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This plague is called in some country with us a sore plague: because it often happens that worms are born, and there is one only sore spot which appears between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves in the whole body, ascending and descending, and is felt through sensation when it walks with its limbs, until it stops wherever it stops in the skin, and it goes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the decay of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are afraid of its malignity.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it moves in the body, and goes up to the head, and reaches a spot: then perhaps it opens in that place, and goes out, and destroys an eye; and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	But when you are to care for him, and to take him out, then he does not do that unless it walks with its limbs, and feels the sensation with its sight.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, so that you tie what is above him, and what is under him with a strong knot.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry up on top of him, and take him out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it penetrates into the flesh and does not affect him: then place cautery over the spot with fire until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater is what is feared, that is corruption of it, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see it already reaching to the head near the eye, then tighten below it a good tight bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over him, and remove him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that he should use his own purification, with medicines solving the bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	[On sectioning over sickness by Al-Nakhi].
Caput XCV.	Chapter 105.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This sickness is called in our language Nakir, and it is a pain that occurs in some member; then it passes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, according as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she raised her arm and I saw an inflamed swelling in the armpit.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one swelling going up with a fire-like heat, as if it were skin, rising faster than it can be: like silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Then the pain receded from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then after an hour he sat down, and ran through the rest of his body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was running all over his whole body, according as I saw it.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed at the speed of its passing from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself did not see this sickness with my eyes before in such a way according to this mode.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who suffered from the passing of pain from one member to another; and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not think that it is, unless because she was one of those who came from the wombs of dried-up bodies whose venes were detected: hence this appears to the sense as a change in windiness.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, hiding the veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you are treating her and the patient feels that pain, then if it appears to you with your eye as we have said, then hold it above her, and under her quickly: and dry above her, until she comes out this windiness: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see the vein with your eyes: then care for the vein with the scraping of the body, and with that which drives out windiness, and makes them red with bitter pills, and with pills of serapeum, and similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrowheads.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LXVI. On the Extraction of Arrowheads.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their species and according to the places in which they are lodged in the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	But there is a difference between them, because there are some that have large points, and small: and埋伏、埋伏し、隠れ潜り
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these there are three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of these some are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And of these some are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	But those that lodge in the limbs, fall in two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or limbs are from the principal limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and those similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When then falls into any of these limbs, and you see signs of death, which I will tell you about later, then it is necessary to remove the arrow from among them, for death follows it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not buried deep within the limb, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the arrow falls into the brain and pierces bone and exits through a hole that is above the brain, then occur: for there occur from it violent sodomy, scotoma, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflammation, redness in the tongue, spasms, confusion of thought, and cholera-like nausea.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out through the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is lost, and speech is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And white pus comes out of the wound's site like mucus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And exits from it similar to a water-like flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	But if these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and pull out the arrow if it has not already exited.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that has hit the heart are: it is near the left nipple: and it feels as if it were almost fixed to a hard thing, not to a soft thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow moves with a similar motion to a pulse: and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it follows that extreme coldness of the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting spells.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	So you know, death has clearly descended.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow that hits the lung is the exit of foamy blood from the wound: and the veins that run along the neck, begin to pulse, and their color changes with the pulse.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, deep breath: and seeks the cool air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	That if an arrow hits the spine, which is in the chest: then it is close to a few ribs: and it becomes a great sigh with violent pain, with a sigh: and the shoulders' muscles all move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow hits the stomach, then perhaps it exits through the mouth from undigested food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow hits the belly and gets stuck there: it exits through the wound with stool, or dung, or already broken intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope for his recovery or for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	For if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine is discharged, and something comes out to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick person, then you should know that it is a fatal wound.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, jaw, back ribs, shoulders, hips, legs, and their corresponding bones, should be tended to according to a number of dispositions. Unless the arrow hits an artery or nerve, and then it is not a mortal wound.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you that I saw such arrows, which indicates to you the hope for your recovery.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	For an arrow fell into a man's eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it from him on the other side, with fat from his ear: and he was healed, and there was no damage to his eye from the arrow.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his eye underneath his eyebrow; and the arrow was now hidden, and I could not extract it unless I cut off part of his cheekbone, where it stuck in its own wood: and it was a large arrow among the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron point, where there were no blades.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was healed, and there was no misfortune to his eye from the arrow.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and that one had blades.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed it with two fingers: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So I took care of it carefully until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow that had fallen into the man's belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After he had been there thirty days and nothing was changed in his condition with regard to the dispositions, I followed him along the line of the bow: and as for his intellect, I took it out from him; and he recovered, and no misfortune befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man who had been struck in the back by an arrow, and the fracture was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After he had been seven years out, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into the belly, and the fracture was healed over it, and the arrow remained within her; and nothing was changed in her condition with regard to any of her natural dispositions, and no harm befell her in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen on the face, and the fracture was healed over it, and remained there, causing him little pain; and I saw many similar cases.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I took out an arrow from a king's son which had fallen on his nose and had sunk a little to the right side; and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So they called me to cure him after the arrow's death for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Then I found the arrow's shaft quite tightly bound.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I asked him what it felt like and he said that he could feel a prick and pain on the right side of his face.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Then I hoped that it might be the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Then I applied a plaster where the drawing-in and digesting force was concentrated, trusting to me that the spot would become better; and it seemed to me as a sign of the arrow, which I should have struck on it: and no misfortune befell in that place as indicating that the arrow followed its course.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I applied the plaster to him for several days; and no misfortune befell him, and his fracture was healed over during that time: but he remained feeble from the extraction of it for a day or so, until he felt an arrow in his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	And I put an acute medicine on that wound and kept it open for many days, until the pain was gone; and when I tried to touch it, I felt a sharp pain in the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added more of the acute medicine to the wound, keeping it open for about four months; and then the tip of the arrow finally showed itself to us: And time passed with me as I continued to apply that acute medicine to the wound.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, when the arrowhead had become larger and was possible for me to insert the hooks into it and move it, I did not cease to be subtle, and devised means with which to work on it; until one day I inserted a certain die with curved hooks in the end of the wound, according to the shape of their tips; then I pulled it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the arrow.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And some doctors say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Then I restored it, and the wound healed, whole and sound: nor did any harm come to him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you about the quality of extraction of some arrows: that you place a rule and meaning on it which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For since the parts of this art and the distinctions thereof are not understood with a narrative; neither does that book understand, and the skilled craftsman compares to little over much: and when something is present he understands it, and when something is absent he understands that too: and he discovers a new operation, and a new instrument for the descent of foreign things in this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then that arrows do not come out from the body by their own power unless they have two types of motion.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from a place from which they entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or through the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrow moving in a fleshly place; and is attracted, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If he does not comply with the exit within the hour in which it falls: then you must let go of him for a few days until his meat that is in his surroundings putrefies: and his attraction will be alleviated, and his egress.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if he is broken into bone, and does not comply with you to the exit, then let go of him also for a few days: and again let it out with attraction and movement every day until he emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if he does not comply with you to the exit after a few days, then you must perform in his circumference with a small blade, until the archers become larger.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If, however, the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already gone into one of the brain vents, and a certain accident appears from those I have mentioned: then abstain from attracting the arrow, and let it go, until it is even with him after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the neck, then death does not prolong for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, unless it penetrates only into bone, and does not reach the neck: and remains weak for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then use your wit in attracting the arrow and pulling it out.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is fixed firmly, and does not comply with you to the attraction: then apply a small blade around the arrow, as I have said: then care for the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow has already gone into hiding in the place of the body, and is hidden and concealed from your sense: then seek it out with trial.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If, however, you feel it, then attract it with some instruments that are suitable for attracting it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot get on top of it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor blood there: then find on top of it, until the bone grows larger, and it becomes possible to pull out the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If they have ears that need to be held, then I fix the free flesh on them from all sides with all the skill you can, and any tricks, if it cannot overcome the skin of the ears in a fracture, and their twisting, until it heals.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use your twisted hands with forceps to all parts until you make it heal: and the last subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot overcome it in one hour, then leave it for a few days, until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for indeed if the flow of blood makes you uncomfortable, then administer what we said in our chapter on cure: and protect your skill from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or chord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer any trick that you can make the arrow heal: and let it be with ease, and peace, or slowness, and strength, as I tell you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do when you pull out the arrow so that it is damaged according to the figure, according to what was with the injury of the arrow on itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more useful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If not, then administer what you can from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, or has already gone out a little to the outside: or makes a bump at the tip of the arrow from the upper part of the skin next to it, and you see it standing out: then cut off over it, and let the section be according to the quantity it holds in it with forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for indeed it is easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If, however, it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until it presses the arrow into the bone, and increases itself on it: and then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: discharge her for a few days; then examine her again until she walks out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If there is an arrow in her, then push it out with the wood.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the arrow has penetrated and you want to give a push: then introduce a concaved tool into her behind the arrow's head: then push it out with the wood.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave: then push it out with an instrument that enters inside.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned: then let there be a concave meat, in which is venenum: if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of her with him when he comes close to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is falling into the chest, or the abdomen, or the groin, and it is close to something that you can feel with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut it off, and carefully avoid cutting the flesh, or a nerve, and take it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then tighten the wound, if you see it, and take care of that, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps, with which the arrows are removed.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The tips should be similar to a pencil, made like an iron: when they grip onto the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of them, large and small, medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, and the depth of the wound, and the width of the wound, and the constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the forceps is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the forceps is flat.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of the forceps like a ray, so that it can enter into the concave part of the arrow, and push it out with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This end of the forceps is concave like a feather, so that it can enter into the concave part of the arrow and push it out.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On phlebotomy of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter LVII on Phlebotomy
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	There are thirty veins which the custom runs in the body and they are called:
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	The sixteen veins in the head are as follows: two pulsating veins, which lie behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries, which appear on either side of the face; and two veins that run from the two eyelids of the eyes, called the two aspirant veins; and a vein that runs across the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	The two jugulars which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And the two veins that run from the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And the two veins that run from the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are called the Algecirachian veins.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And the two veins that lie under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five in all.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the cephalic vein and it runs on the lateral side; and it is called the common vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	And the fuscal.

Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the phlebotomy of them is done according to two ways.

And of these there are different species, and subtle according to the length of the nails and the tightness of their form Phlebotomy with a twig is broad, as you see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening closed nails, full of blood, coming from within, thick, and those that contain thick blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of smaller latitude, and more subtle in its extremities.

¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	In regards to phlebotomy:
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The bazooka, which is a single harum vein phlebotomy, is the following:
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	For it draws blood from the ailments that are beneath the throat and neck, for it proceeds towards the chest and abdomen; and it is appropriate to draw blood with phlebotomy where there lies an artery, lest a mistake be made, for under it lies an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If one then makes a mistake and adds phlebotomy on top of it, he will cut the artery and cause a flow of blood to occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, in order not to phlebotomize while puncturing with the phlebotome: let it be done by one who is skilled in suturing with the awl.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	For if the bazooka does not appear visibly, then you should remove it, and rotate it towards another location, or seek out one of its branches: or perform phlebotomy at a site where an artery lies.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is apparent, and cut it with the awl, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you desire to phlebotomize this same bazooka, then it is appropriate to do so prior to the brachial artery's bend, in order to identify the spot that needs to be punctured.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the site with a caustic substance, then cut the arm, and perform phlebotomy by means of a section that is bent inwards with the awl, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And ensure that the blow does not fall outside the space from the site of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that the tendon has been tightened, and there is swelling at the site that you marked with the caustic substance, then this swelling is due to artery inflammation; therefore, avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rising at the site of phlebotomy, resembling urine from a boy, and it is subtle, ruby-colored blood; then know that it comes from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore place your hand upon the wound and then remove it.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If then blood is cut (for indeed it is often cut) then tie the arm tight, and let go of it: and let the sick one be careful to his motion: and sit over his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not moan for a few days, until he is well.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If then the blood is not cut, and it hurts you: and there is no present medicine for you at hand, then cut the artery, if it seems to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities do hurt, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the skin of a frog, and find it: or take half, and tie it on the neck, with thread and powder, until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then the care of him with him is a reminder from the place of the dust flowing blood from his wound: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many places, because of the small wound, and possibility of thread from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On phlebotomy of the vein of the frog.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	For the veins of the frog are a help in phlebotomy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower body: for it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the Cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it belongs to the phlebotomist, that he be over his fear from his phlebotomy, for there is a nerve under it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If then he adds to the piercing of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, there comes stupor on it, and its cure is difficult, and perhaps it does not heal thoroughly.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If then it is hidden in some men and is subtle and does not show itself: then you shall put your phlebotomy so that the phlebotomist puts it, and cutting away of the nerve with strength of his.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If it is between two nerves, then find one nerve in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Regarding the cerebral vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	However, phlebotomy of the cerebral veins is an indication as it attracts blood from the head and contributes to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein to be particular, if you wish, so that when you phlebotomy with a phlebotome oil-bearing, or with a phlebotome myrtle: for it is salutary for all veins, since there is no arterial subcutaneous nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, you should be careful when phlebotomy, so that you only use the head of the lacerte, and seek a more comfortable place: and it will not hurt him if, after hitting it first, you return to it with phlebotomy occasionally.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps he should be stopped in some people when not phlebotomized in the first hit, but it does not hurt him that spasm in a certain place.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Regarding the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be taken when observing it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and accidents from it that you should consider in its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, therefore, of these is the fact that you should know, that phlebotomy is administered not unless in the preservation of health, and perseverance, and caution from the advent of ailments.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy is done in one vein of three which are in the bed, namely, Cephalica, and Fusca, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy is done at the beginning of spring on a fast, in truth, and summer: and in autumn, and winter after a meal, when there are signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And so that phlebotomy is done on the first day, or on the third day, having passed three hours after the end of the three days.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, the phlebotomy administered in ailments does not have a determined time: but when it provokes conveniently and necessity to it, at night, or during the day, and at any hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	It is not appropriate for boys to be bled until they are fourteen years old.

Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	And it is not appropriate to bleed the elderly who have already passed the age of sixty.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Since then, whoever wishes to bleed should first make their bowels clean before bleeding with a mild enema if they have held much feces in their bowels: so that the dirty secretions do not attract blood from the main vessels when bleeding.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	And it is not appropriate to bleed a patient who is dizzy, that is, nauseated; and it is not appropriate to bleed someone who is sweating due to drinking alcohol, until they have recovered from that state.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	And it is not appropriate to bleed a sick person with hydrops.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let bleeding be repeated after a diarrhea, and after vomiting, and after the flow of blood, and after multiple copulations, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the physical body or from animals.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtleties of the humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicine: if possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then apply a lukewarm bath, if he permits anything; or exercise himself with some exercise, to render the blood subtile.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his bleeding in his chest, on the third day as we have said: and wait until his chest is empty of all animal evil on that day: such as anger, fear, and distress: and of all physical evils, such as labor, punishment, excesses, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make present with him these things from which he usually enjoys the custom of men out of aroma, and fragrance, and feast, and similar things by way of quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomizer sit on a raised platform, which is higher than the phlebotomy platform: then let him remove his arm, and rub it with his own hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tighten the ligamen with a correction tool, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	Then make the incision at a slight angle, because if the incision is uneven or there is excess fluid in the incision, then it will prevent the flow of blood; or if it is softened, then it will also prevent the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the incision, he should hold his fingers together on the wound while shaking them back and forth until they are red, and then expose the sensation.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist will clean the phlebotomy with a little oil, his own old one.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he will place his left-hand index finger on the wound below where he plans to make a phlebotomy, slightly: so that the blood does not flee, and the pulse is preserved.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For it is from the veins that one draws as if from a running chord when phlebotomy is performed; and those are full of blood: and when you place the phlebotomy on them, it will be closed under the phlebotomy, and will deceive the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, then it is tight: so that for this reason, it should be that the phlebotomist firm, and is vigilant in these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he will place the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then a vein opens from one vein, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then go back to the next vein below it a little, or above it with some speed: if not, the place will not stick.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if it sticks, or it is weak, then let it go for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligamen.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps, because the stickiness of the blood may attract the cold.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And it should not be bathed in bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he will go back to phlebotomy if he loves it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or the blood runs slowly: and be careful not to discharge a quantity greater than that which you take: then go back to the wound with the phlebotomy second time, and add a little more in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And make it with haste, before the place is measured, for the place is measured by many men during lung surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	But if you see that it has already been measured, then do not go over it at all, for nothing excuses you with regard to this before me.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something soft on the wound from a tube of oil: because it soothes the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oil as well.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And also administer oil in all your phlebotomies, when phlebotomizing veins with a banishment of blood flow: and make it with touriaca and sago, when put from one of them on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is weakened and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	For if it happens in the place of phlebotomy a great apostema, for many times does happen, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or is an opening of a small vein, then bind it and put over it a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly warmed: and hold it for an hour: because it is solved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood out of the vein itself with its complement, or out of another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	For if it remains in the place for a certain number of days of darkness or of viridity, then does not hurt that: and if there is a swelling, put over it something of aloe, or of myrrh dissolved: or some of the juice of mint, namely, of calamus or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times do happen apostemas and eminenties during phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So put your hand over it, then if you feel a soft feeling under pressure when your hand is on it, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Be careful therefore, so that you put over it something of what I said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps there is blood flowing out from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But put a plaster on it with him where there is stenosis, so that the place toughens up.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with the rest of the cure, until you are healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that he should give blood to everyone in accordance with the amount of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color that blazes on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let him not go out until he turns red: and likewise, if he appears thick, then let him not go out until he becomes thinner: and also, if it has keenness, then let its keenness be taken away from it.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full of blood, strong and resistant to the extraction of blood by one vessel, so that the venesection of the black blood may be increased, and let the phlebotomist stand on the side: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he should extract himself with the vessels and that a tight hole should be made: and it is better if it is administered in the venesection of the black blood, that it is turned across, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood and from cutting the nerve: and it is more worthy and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for those who are prone to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary that they eat a little before phlebotomy with bread soaked in grape juice: or secernia, if he is hot: and let him give blood from his blood in three vessels, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he has a pale complexion, then let him take bread soaked in honey syrup, or in honey syrup flavored with spices, or in scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If it happens that there is syncope during phlebotomy, and it is caused by a lot of blood going out: then let him drink water of meat, and slightly sweet syrup: and he should use the aroma with allspice, and rub his chest while he breathes, and use the rest that we have mentioned in the division on syncope from discharge.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to bandage his own arm and stop the flow of blood should have phlebotomy performed on him often, and his power should be weak, so that he stops the flow of blood gradually over a long period of time.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	However, whoever wants to bandage his own arm and stop the flow of blood should have phlebotomy performed on him often, and if his body is strong, he should do it after seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to draw blood from his body toward the opposite side of the body should do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	If, however, there is already much blood in the body that has become warm and has increased fever, you should let out a lot of blood in one go and extract a large quantity from it; and by enlarging the opening until syncope occurs, then after you have performed all the conditions of phlebotomy, and having placed your hand on its pulse at the place of the flow of blood, so that death does not occur at the site of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	This happens several times when the phlebotomist does not know, and he falls because of negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate when you want to bandage an arm and stop the flow of blood a second time, if the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, so that it presses on itself with a sudden movement, and curls quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is very painful, in the middle of it, let go of it until it is phlebotomized second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of phlebotomy that which has coagulated blood in the opening of the vein, and put a little dissolved salt on it in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place over it some of the tar-water or the color of the sea, and place on it a soft compression until blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein is already seared, then let go of it, and do not tie it up, until it has softened.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity calls for the blood to be stopped by second-intent surgery, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomy itself above that place, or in the arm in a vein of another.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the veins of the arm are phlebotomized at the place of Fuscus and Basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the sick person should dip his hand in hot water until it turns red, and then a vein will appear clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then tie over it with a little tight ligature.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomize second-intent little by little, not laterally, and not along its length: and let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy let it be a little above the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the blood output is prohibited, then repeat the hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water, until you have met your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from repeating the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the course of blood in hot water is put many times in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this vein's phlebotomy is better than all the veins, because it is not a pulsating vein, nor is it nervous.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	But phlebotomizing the right hand's veins confers benefits on people with liver sickness.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you should tie the massager's hand with a ligature, or your hand after you have dipped it in hot water, until a vein bends, and it appears to the touch very much.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize it by going across it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you hit it completely, it will not hurt that one at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep, so that you do not repeat the phlebotomy on your hand.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Because under it are the nerves of the fingers stripped from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then again put your hand to warm water, and let the blood flow out of it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not dry it in warm water, the blood will congeal in the orifice of the urethra, and its flow is stopped.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have drawn out a quantity of blood as needed, then put oil and salt on the urethra so that it does not congeal quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise you should do in like manner with every broken limb.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The instrument for phlebotomy is in the left hand, since it relates to splenitis; and likewise you should do with its phlebotomy, as you did with the second one, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The instrument for phlebotomy, however, is used for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as those of the mother, and retention of menstruation, and ailments of the kidneys and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar ailments from illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that it should touch the sick foot with warm water; and make friction on it until the urethra flows; and tie above the knot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the urethra is at the heel, visible towards the thumb; and many branches emerge from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Phlebotomy should be made in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its gathering; for it is better and more salutary.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	Since if you phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then take care away from the nerves that are under it over the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy so as not to cut it when you phlebotomy from above, as if you wish not to hit it; and the phlebotomist is called Celsus.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the exit of blood is stopped, then put his foot again in warm water; and let the blood flow out of it until it runs clear.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotome has made a mistake in the first cut, then it is better to proceed with phlebotomy to some degree upward, for the site is healthy, and do not fear ill effects from it when you are drawing from the nerves as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the outside forest.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the phlebotomy for it is to the pain of the ankle, when the blood is warm.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is so that he shall enter a hot bath and sweat, and tighten his leg from the ankle up to the heel with four fingers, because it does not appear except for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it then appears, then phlebotome it as you can manage your skill, or after a turn: and it is better to do either of these, or as if you were to cut it, or separate it by sectioning.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the site of it is healthier, and it is hidden well in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not feel it at all: then phlebotome a small branch of it, and that is which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and draw from the nerves, and let it run with blood in quantity as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then bind it tightly, and place the site of the phlebotomy on top of the skin, and tighten the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Regarding ventilation, and the quality of use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Wind instruments are made from horns, and from air, and from heat.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Wind-instrument making is done according to two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When it comes to scarring and drawing blood, and the other is wind instrument making without scarring.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Wind-instrument making without scarring is according to two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For fire is with the heat.
Aut est absque igne.	Or is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the four places of the body that are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is Ventosa of the King, and it is in the last place of the head: and Al-Khel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the two ventilations of the neck from both sides at the same time: and the ventilation of the mind, and it is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the ventilation of the two spatulas: and the ventilation of Al-Akhous on the end of the tail: and the ventilation of the two fires, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the ventilation of the two chaps: and the ventilation of the two shoulders.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And the ventilation is not drawn blood from you from the small vessels scattered in the flesh, and for that reason the power does not fall from them, such as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	And it should not be administered with ventilation if it is with fire or without fire in any disease that happens from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity requires ventilation because of illness or custom, we will administer it at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, for there is a man who, when the blood multiplies in him, does not find it until he extracts it by ventilation, but has a headache, and swallows.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And of them is one who finds fullness and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And of them is one who finds itching on his face, forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And of them is one who scars the place of his ventilation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And of them is one whose laugh multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And of them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth, or spits with his tongue and spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from these, whose dreams multiply.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And of those who see in their dreams blood and ruddyness, and those who are slain, and plagues, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When then do we see anything from them, and especially if it is on the third day of the month: we then order that a vision be made, after they have passed two or three hours from the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	But the oath of the vision by sleep is this: for it comes to a burden on the head, and that it gushes out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But indeed it should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is called a wind by phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it should not be used as to one who has a cold complexion, or one in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it infers a great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this it is not good that they use them to the elderly, and in whom there are illnesses of a cold head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever uses it constantly, he causes oblivion to himself.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this it is necessary that you order the wind-worker to put his hand down a little with the wind, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The wind-chafing, or alkohl, is the place of phlebotomy of the flesh, and phlebotomy of the bazils, and because of it brings about air, and constriction of breath, and fissures of the instrument of breath, and coughs, and filling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Wind-chafing be driven a little further, for if it is put down, it brings about weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The wind-chafing, however, brings about pain in accidents in the head, and eyes, and headaches, and piercing, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of phlebotomy of the bazils.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you order the Wind-worker to not put his hand out with the scarification: that he may not hit an artery, and may not happen a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Winding the nose with alcohol, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth: and it remains in place after phlebotomy Aleherich, which are on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Winding the spatulas, add alcohol, which is done with a retraction and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	But winding the inner parts of the two veins, take hold of the phlebotomy of the new three, Basilike, and Fusca, and Cephalica: for they themselves attract blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins attract the blood from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary so that you order the winders, so that it does not go too far in the scarification: because the place is naked of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But wind that winds over the Alcahuse, brings hemorrhoids of the Anus, and ulcers of the lower parts.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary so that you order the winders, so that there is a strong suction and it is made of metal: because the place does not like a strong suction, and perhaps the fine winders break: and the scarification is done with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the winders of the legs decrease with evident reduction: because they attract blood from all the body, and bring about old pains in the kidneys, and membranes, and vesicles: causing menstruation, and giving birth to bothor and bewitchment: and remain in place after phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, it weakens the body very much, and causes fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the phlebotomy of alhorcoben is close to the phlebotomy of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the winders is that you place the winder in the first place in the vacuum, and moisten with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the winders, but put them quickly, and move them quickly, so that the humors go to the place of entry evenly: and do not stop to repeat that and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and appears redness of blood: then therefore scarify, and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of flesh tender, and rare porridge, it is necessary that the scarifices should be made once only, not more, lest the place should ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And order the Ventosator to increase the scarification, and make it a little deeper: and moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and movement of itself.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	That if there is grossness in the blood, then it is necessary that the scarifices should be made twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In a first indeed the way of subtillation of blood is opened, and its water-likeness: and in a second indeed the careful examination of the extraction of gross blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be made a third time: that the last result be obtained.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the last, when we have extracted the blood little by little, or a little more, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we have extracted the blood many times, let us make multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure, that the blood is gross: then it is necessary that the scarification should be made deep: and the equal term in the scarification, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which should be administered out of oils at the disposition of the Ventosas, and what cauterizes the Ventosando?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	IN that indeed whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places of the Ventosas be oiled with open, soothing, dissolved oils: if in season of summer, as is the oil of alkyli, or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in season of winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lilies, or oil of chamomile, or oil of sage: and these similar.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if the superfluity is gross, cold: then oil of bitter apricot, or oil of myrrh, or oil of alburnum, or oil of annatto: and these similar.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the wound is wide and the flesh is tender, then one should prohibit the use of oil and one should wash these wounds with rosewater, cold water, water from a herb called "solatri", water from a herb called "cucurbita", or water from a plant called "portulaca", and similar waters.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But if the blood is of one who has much moisture, he should wash the wounds with vinegar or with myrtle water and sumac: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But if the sweat is thick, he should wash his wounds with old wine or with samsou water, or with a decoction of anet or chamomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the bathing be done in a bath or in a shower room; and moreover, it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And one should not sleep after bathing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is needed so that the wound is treated with care, or with phlebotomy before bathing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	AND after that, you should consider first of all: if then the wound is on a cholerical person, and the sharpness and inflammation of his blood are great: then let him take something cooling, such as granatum mus [pomegranate juice]; also lettuce, vinegar, and pepper, and garlic: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put before him food of fowl, and meat that swells up, and cooked food with fruit: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if his complexion is cold, let him drink in a cup syrup of honey, or of almond, or alsecaniabin made from seeds; and let him drink red wine, which is between new and old; and let it be commanded that he eat little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put before him food of fowl and mead; and pigeons, that is, many birds: and let him eat pigeon soup.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	It is necessary that the drink of bleeding and phlebotomy be more than food: and it is necessary that it be given in drinks to some men in the hours of tyrocha alfaroch, or a remedy of musk, that is, muscat, or aeselsithe before bleeding; and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the main members are comforted and the blood thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it should not be drunk in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Bleeding without Scarification:
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	And those that are bleeding but not scarified, are Ventose that are placed on the liver, and the spleen, and the podagra, and over the windpipe, and the navel, and the places of the kidneys, and the pixie of the anus: for these members do not suffer scarification on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And is not sought through them, unless it is to attach a drop of blood from one member to another: as we place the Ventose on the breasts in the illness of flux of blood to the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them so that we solve a cold windiness from one member into another: as we place the Ventose on the windpipe and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and relieves the pain because it resolves the windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also is placed on the kidneys when there occurs in them urination, or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For with his virtue of attraction it perhaps opens urination, or removes a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And also when it is placed on the liver and the spleen to relieve windiness in them both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Ventose are administered with a cut only by part.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And when they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in the illness of pleural pain: and that is, so that the Ventose be filled, and great, with hot water alone, or with water in which have been boiled herbs that are appropriate.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Ventilated forms administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Form the opening so that it is two fingers wide, according to what we have made: and its quantity in the depth be half of a palm: and in the back of it at the place which is around the middle of it, there is a small hole, according to how much it is put into it the spike: let it be made of bronze or copper, with rounded edges, smooth, equal, and three-sided: so that it does not hurt the limb at its position over it: and in the middle of it place a wire across from bronze, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this flowing water is made great, greater than we have told you, and the lesser one little less, according to his illness and age who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the winds of young people, and they are weakened by others, as much as the winds of men, and as much as the bodies of those who are big.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	But the quality of putting this wind with fire on a limb is, to light up the wood with fire from linen carelessly, or set a small candle made of wax: and put it on the middle of the wire that is across in the middle of the wind: so that the fire surrounds the lower part of the wind, so that the body does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then put it on the limb: and the finger is over the opening which I said, until we hold it: when we don't hold it, remove the finger, and the vapor will come out of that hole, and the wind will immediately be released.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then with this fire light up it, according to its kind, and repeatedly do it, if you don' t mind it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the wind that is administered in illness with water there is no cross wire, and it is not administered, unless it fills with water, and is put on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wind is the greater, as much as it takes in a lot of water, it is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	About suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	The blood-sugar should not be given in many cases, unless the limb is such that the vials can be placed on it, because of their smallness, like the lips and gums and things similar to them.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member stripped of flesh, such as a finger or a nose, and so on.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of the use that is made of them is this: as you obtain from blood-sugar which are in sweet water, clean from putrefactions.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be removed by day and night from sweet water, until they are hungry, and there should remain in their stomachs nothing at all.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated with phlebotomy, and with blood-sugar.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the member is washed with milk, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, and fall down, and it is possible to suck the place with a wand, then it is more of a last resort to wipe the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with a lot of water, and it is rubbed, and expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood is prolonged after the application of blood-sugar, and it is this residue: then put a cloth made of linen in cold water, and place the member upside down, until the residue disappears.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood multiplies, then sprinkle on top of it crushed ginger, or nards, and things similar to them: until the blood is dried up.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on top of the spot half of herbs that are cut, and leave them, until the herbs adhere to the spot, because the blood is dried up.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary to repeat the application of blood-sugar when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If blood-sugar are prohibited from suspension, then the spot is washed with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or plug up the place with plaster, until something of the blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be placed on, for when they feel something from the blood, they will cling at once.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall, sprinkle over them some powder of trodden-down aloes, or salt, or ash: and they will fall at once.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	§ Part Two Finale.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasis Part Three.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	§ Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, Cure of Twists, and Like Cases.
Caput I.	Head One.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and consists of the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye sons, that many medical and laymen do err concerning this chapter, having not examined the ancient book carefully, nor read its letter thoroughly.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this cause it is, that this mode of knowledge from the sciences of our own country is rare.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was not ignorant of it at all, and was not accomplished in it, except through the length of reading ancient books, and studying their understanding, until I extracted the science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by experiment and study of a long life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have already described to you from that same text all the science contained therein: and having passed over experiment of my own, which I abreviated for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, I abreviated that also by the end of abridgment, and showed that end by the end of declination; and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments used therein, with the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	§ First, and the collection from the essence of fractures of bones, out of which the premise is necessary before we begin to remark the members of the fractured bones, and diverse, if of each one.
Caput II.	Head Two.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prolog of this chapter the essence of the speech and the chapters on which it is considered first to consider the master at the station regarding its truth: namely that you and those who are quick know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore that when it happens to someone that there is a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall: then it is necessary that you should be the first to phlebotomate him and to resolve him, or both together: if not prohibit anything, as the strength of virtue: or is he who has happened something from those boys: or an old decrepit man: or is the time of feverish heat, or feverish cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be satisfied with his food, cold drinks, and meat of birds and heads: and prohibit wine, and gross meats, and eating in abundance from the table and all food that fills the blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from the feverish heat, and do not time the flow of fluid into the member: then return the sick to his usual routine first with whom his custom runs.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Then when the mouth that is broken begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick eat food that is nourishing, with a lot of moisture, and thick, and dark, in which there is freshness: such as are the foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and livers of cattle, and eggs, and fish fresh: and strong wine, and similar to them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	Because this regime, when it has been thus set in motion, the clotting of a fracture moves faster, and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you should know that bones that are broken, when they are in the age of old age and decrepitude, cannot continue and harden according to their nature forever, because of the drying up of their members: and they harden and continue those that are at the end of slowness, as the bones of young boys of small age.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Indeed, nature joins together the broken bone from all sides with a similar glue, which is thick, which adheres to and tightens it until it heals from within and is tied from within, until it returns to its strength and solidity as before, unless it prevents itself from performing its operations: and for this reason, you must place food in the patient's diet, in which there are light foods, and drinks, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs; for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull bone, and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the spine bone, and likewise each limb has all its parts different from one another; and I came with a reminder of all the types of fractures presented in their own chapter, distinct from the other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures also differ from one another.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it happens that a fracture is curved, except that it happens in it that the stars collide.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of the limb, that is, stars, and additions that come from, as there are in the reed when it is cut with a pen to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not coming from: and there is a fracture with a nail and a break in the head: and there is a small crack fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And all its species has an invention, or its own instrument in restoring it, according to which comes the reminder of it, separate in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that it is known that a bone fracture has occurred, is its curvature and eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	And when it is not in place, the curvature of its appearance is not apparent, and its sound does not come to your hand when you touch it with agitation, and there is no great pain: then it is not a fracture there, but possible that there is a curvature or a small crack: so it is not necessary that you move it with your hand and compress it completely, but rather put it on top of it from the medicines, of which comes the reminder, after a while that it fits into place: then tie it tightly with a narrow band.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place is ever so much the better when it arches and splits in two, except for what happens to it by chance, but every part moves away from its comrade: then you must begin to rectify it from your own hour, making it even before it happens to him an apostema of warmness.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a warm apostema has happened to him, then you must leave him for a few days until the apostema is quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make the arch even according to whichever way you can out of slowness and artifice.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it, and its making even, is easier than the bones, in which accidents happen.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it, according to which way you may remember it for yourself.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if the accidents are in a bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member out of two parts, if the hand is, or the foot: or with your hand itself, if the member is small: or with two strings, or with a string and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And put the member in such a position that you set it on a place equal to its own natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then be careful, as if you are going to bring back additions with artifice, and in whatever way you can in your places: and be careful according to your strength, so that no pain happens to the weak by your operation, nor any excess: and be careful according to your strength, that you join one of two bones with its comrade, according to the better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in this hour, as if you are going to hold and touch the member with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	But if you see anything different there, then rectify it, and make even that by the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful about swift extension, and strong compression, as many dull-witted people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often by their own operation they bring about a warm apostema or a contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after equalisation, and after the operation has been performed, and after having tightened his member, and after resting and tranquillity: and warn the sick man himself.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let him avoid any motion, lest he move himself in the hour of his need, and let him sleep in his own bed during his recovery, and during his pain and during his eruption, and during all his movements by his last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he may be careful not to position his member in a way that causes him pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels the pain of the member's position, or its injury: then it should be that he changes himself to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him so that his position is equal and straight: so that no twisting of the member occurs when he recovers.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a broken-member's tightness is according to the narrowness.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken members differ in their width, and in their size, and in their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of them are smaller, such as the arm, and the finger, and the foot, and the like to them, then it should be that the cloth is soft, thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which of them are thick, such as the hip, and the leg, it should be that the cloth is wide, hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a broad ligament connects a large member, and tightens it with equal tightness from all parts, so that it does not enter the member any stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, begin to apply a soft ointment suitable for it, in a soft poultice over the break's place.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to rub three or four times over the break' place, according to how large the member is: and grip your hand lightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then walk with him towards the upper part from the break' place, and tighten less than your usual tightness, which you tightened the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen you with the joint to the place of fracture somewhat, and make the stiffening soft gradually, until you take out from the place sound matter great.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another and work on it again with the joints on the broken place of joint workings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then lead with the joint to the lower part, which is injured.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your work in the stiffening of the joint and its softening, according to what we said in the first upper working.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the joints of the joint with a soft cloth or with anything that suits the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature in it: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then work on the other taken out one again.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then set equal on these working joints disc-shaped ones that are slightly off center, if there is no swelling in the place, and without any heat.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling on it, or a fever: then set over it what sits on the swelling, and let it take off the swelling: and let it go for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie up on it at that time discs.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the discs be made from half a can of flour, ground, formed wisely: or let them be made of wooden slats that are made into cribs, which are made of pine, or branches, that is to say, palm shoots: and let the width of each disc be according to this form, and this figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	But it is necessary that the disc put over the joint should be a bit bigger and wider than other discs: and the length of the disc should be according to what suits the member in size and shape.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie up on the discs with another thread, according to the first stiffening.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie on top with disc-shaped joints that are slightly off center, according to what we said about the stiffening: and it is, so that your stiffening is over the broken place more: and the more it is stretched from the fracture, the less stiffening.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	It is fitting that they be fine and average in size and delicate, and made from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Since if the stitches are thick, as is the case with the stitches of those who make sutures from twisted linen cords, it is a great mistake: for tightness is lost with them outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin stitches again do not agree: for you do not achieve that which you wish with them in tightness, that is to say the thread.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it should not be, that it is between a finger and a hand width less than.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	Since if the sick person is hurt through the ends of the stitches after tightness in healthy places: then place under them from soft cloth or red wool, until nothing hurts from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with the bone, and there has been a breakdown on the skin, I will go back to his consideration in the second chapter with regard to uniqueness.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be sutured from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb is large when it is, it should not be placed on top of stitches, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security against the development of seroma.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of ancient emplasters, which were placed on fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	**Common Shortened Emplaster Method, Restoring Fracture, Suitable for Various Complexions, Especially Women, and Children**: since it is from this that heat does not hurt, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, so that you take from a flour-like powder, and there is a crumb of bread hanging on the walls of the mortar when the mill is in motion: and you lay it down as it is, except that you rub it with alum: and place its coating not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	**Other Method of Emplaster, Restoring Fracture and Dislocation and Twist**:
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Mix almes, laudane, acacia, enulae, myrrh, and aloe with the oil of citronella and alethos, 20 parts each, and with water; or, if the wound is festering, mix them with albugine.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and is beneficial to many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A different method of the plaster which also benefits fractures and dislocations.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Mix mugath, almes, and alethos white, of myrrh 10 parts, aloe and acacia each 5, and balsam 20 parts, thoroughly; then grind them, and mix with water or albugine, and apply it.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of the plaster for joints, and bones separated from their places: it soothes pain in the injury, bone separation, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Soak a wool pad in vinegar and oil, and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	This plaster is not effective for healing fractures, but it is beneficial for soothing pain and inflammation.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of the plaster which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Soak leaves of fig and wild papaya, thoroughly grind them, and make a plaster of both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A shortened method of the plaster to be applied for restoring a broken bone; and when you wish to treat an inflammation remaining after the fracture has healed.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Mix root of alethos, chamomile, flowers of violets, and herb flour, all in equal parts; thoroughly grind them, and mix with wine, if it is not a member of the body that needs to be warmed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if it needs to be warmed, then prepare it with water and coriander seed, moistened with alethos; or, if it is to be used with water, then use alethos water itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A stronger method for poulticing, which is to be used when this first poultice fails and the wound becomes infected during the healing of the limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Grind the roots of plantain and the seeds of flax and fennel and mallow and sarsaparilla and the flowers of chamomile, all in equal parts, then they are to be mixed with either salt water or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this should be applied according to the heat of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that poultices should be placed on a broken member during its healing except those made from ash and oil: nothing else: and he related that they should be of a middling consistency between grossness and lightness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen, however, has said that poultices should be placed on a broken member during its healing in which there is drying up of heat, such as myrrh and aloe and olive oil and similar things from those which we have described.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A poultice that is beneficial for wounds and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Grind moth and chickpea and human hair and bird feathers and plantain seeds and salt in equal parts: they are to be ground and siftered and made into a poultice.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But the quantity, however, according to what is necessary, so that there remains a paste, and then let it be dissolved, consider this then, if pain does not occur, or itching, or the broken bone moves from its place: do not then dissolve it over many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If however there occurs to it an irritating itching, or a troubling pain, or swelling: then put on the paste without delay, and dissolve it at once, and remove the poultice from it: and take a linen cloth or a marine sponge wet with water: and dip it in tepid water and wash the place with it until the itching is calmed down and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then, let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then cover the wound with wool dipped in vinegar and oil, or oil seasoned with rosewater; and bind it up for the night, so that it may be free from heat, and the inflammation of the member may cease, and the pain thereof be removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then, again, apply a thin plaster; and do not tighten your bandage the first time, nor with delicate ligatures, until the wound is healing.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and inflammation are all gone, and that the wound has healed thoroughly, and that your bandage and constriction are comfortable, then again apply the plaster as before.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of these things happens to the member, then do not remove the bandage until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it has been twenty days, as far as appears to you from the healing of the member, even as we have said, until such time as the fracture is united, and the blood-clot on it is firm; then add also at that time more constriction than your first constriction; and add also at that time greater swelling by food, as far as recalls.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already drying up, and growing less than it should: then know that food is forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Cover it therefore with lukewarm water at all times, and keep the bandage on for three days, and loosen the constriction slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this means then the member runs to the food, and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which do the foolish healers from the fracture of a member, when they do not heal first, as is necessary, and heal second to its tortuosity, is an error in their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have said about it in their books, and they would have worked on it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere on them their footprints at all, and it is better that it should not be.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Head.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are different kinds of fractures and many forms of them; and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a blow there results a fracture when the bone is completely broken until it reaches the socket, which is under the bone, as does the ax in the wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a certain blade incises some bone and incises its face, but the incision does not penetrate to its end; and this kind of fracture is called Kalān, that is, Absoluutio.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a limb when there are two fractures, or one great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And one is a break, that is, a crushing, or an rubbing; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or the like.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this break is also penetrating, when it approaches a flap, which is under the bone: or is in the face of the bone; and a limb of these two fractures is also small, or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And one is a secret fracture in the bone in a hair's breadth: and it is a small crack; and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And of these is a fracture which results from a fall, or a blow with a stone, and similar things, which make a layer of bone go inside, and it is joined together by a clamping: as happens in the case of an axe when it falls on it, and some of them go inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And many things are done to this in the heads of wet bones, such as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures have separate names, and I will go back to them when I remind myself of the whole.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by their detection over them, and their inquiry with respect to them, and the removal of corrupt flesh from them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	Indeed, the capillary is known by this, that it is detected over the bone, and eradicated, and secured on itself with caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of a fracture, the first things to be considered are the nursing accidents: then if you see from these accidents what signifies a clear sign on fear, such as fainting with cholera, and spreading, and loss of reason, and cutting off of speech, and syncope, and acute fever, and exit of the eyes, and redness of them, and such things to those accidents in many dispositions, it is certain that they do not heal: and if you see from these accidents non-terrifying things, and hope for healing: then begin to cure him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a person comes to you wounded first with a wound: and it is in the middle of winter, then one should seek to remove the bone by the fourth day after the second day:
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then one should seek to remove the bone by the seventh day before it corrupts what is under the bone from a flap, and those accidents which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That is, if the fracture of the bone has already reached to a flap touching the brain, and it is with small, and attraction: then one should seek to break off a part that is crushed, and ground, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, as you shave the head of a wounded person: and you detect over the bone in any way that you can: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is softest above the ill.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That is, if you experience a flow of blood for you at the detection of the bone, or hot effusion: then oppose it to that which is needed.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, as you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the effusion subsides, and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the cure of bones and their removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The one mode is that you break the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then take another Incisory, wider by as much as the first: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also take another Incisory, wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second mode is that you have with you a number of Incisories of various widths, some broader and some narrower: and let them be at the extremities of their sharpness, and let some of them be made of iron or brass: and use the ease in striking on the Incisory so that it does not cut the head and hurts itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong and hard: then you must perforate around it before administering the Incisories with the Terribles, which are not called so except because they do not pass beyond the end of the bone's flesh towards it: for this reason, the Terribles are round extremities above that, which is under its acute head, similar in edge, and a little circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is necessary for you to take a great number of these Terribles, and each one should correspond to the thickness of the bone, until you have all of them on hand: but let the acuteness of their extremities be of various length and brevity, according to the thickness of their bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three kinds of Terribles, or trepanations.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	But the quality of piercing around a broken bone is this: that you place a Terriblem on the bone and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the Terriblem to another place and place what is between all the apertures of its thickness or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the scalpel where it is between all openings from bone: and make it finer than you can over it at the end of lightness, as we said, until you have removed the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument which you have prepared for it: such as needles, and fine awls.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary, so that you take all caution, lest it touch the brain, or any of the incisor teeth from the sipha.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have surrounded the bone by perforating it, and it has been separated from the sipha, if it is continuous with that, and you extract it, it is necessary that you shave it, and make its extremities as equal as possible, what remains in the bone with another similar scalpel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thin and fine with other scalpel
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If then there remains a little of the bones, and they are small, then take them with ease, with the one that is with you from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after it with linen, and the ointment which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of operation is simple, by no means far from fear: which said Galen, and commended it with great praise: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	Necessarily you should first, so that you begin to grasp the bone's part where the fracture is more painful, and more evident: until when you have grasped it, and placed under it the end of this lente
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, which does not cut anything; and the acute part of it on its two sides in length, as you see: so that it is the lenticular part placed at the sipha, facing the acute end of it into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then beat over the incisor on its one part with a little mallet, until you cut all the bone with ease, as it is broken up: and you are safe from the panel, which does not happen to it any accident, which you are very afraid of.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the medicans were not more stupid and ignorant of it, and did not sleep, then if there remained something attached to the bones from the panniculus in some places, he would fall from him with the sharp end of his lens, and would free himself from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For he would be freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the panniculus, and the piece which is torn off from the bone is the form of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtle furrows: then it is necessary that you should scrape away this roughness, and cut out those subtleties with very fine razors which you have prepared, so that it is possible for you to administer them in every place more convenient for them, and straighter for their form, according to the operation which brings you, and the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your ratio, especially at the root of the bone, a wider space for these razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after this a finer edge.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to make it according to continuity, until you reach the point of administering them more fine, and finer of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each and every one of the tiny cracks that remain from the hair, and the subtle fracture, it is necessary that you should administer care, according to that which brings you to the straighten of it.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is a thing which is not hidden over all, to which in this art is any study, and stands over that which we have written, and shown in the great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the panniculus is caught, when you cut the bone: then it is necessary that you should take linen cloth, according to the quantity of wound, and submerge the bone in rose oil, and place the bone on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of linen cloth, doubled or tripled, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth: and make it so that you can do it as easily as possible, so that it does not chafe.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the medicine over the ligament; and do not tie it up too tightly, except for as much as the fracture requires: and release it on the first or second day, until you are free from the heat of the wound.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it and apply the medicines with which it is useless to be dry: such as lily roots, herb flour, thistle powder, aristochaos, and similar ones; and this is how you should make a powder from these medicines, which should be sprinkled over the fracture like those that are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And apply universally on it all the medicine of its property which is to cleanse and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And let it be smooth in your cure, so that the fracture is smooth: and let there be no gum in it, nor any dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not let there be any excess of the medicine at all in it: for when the excess is applied on the skin of the brain, it corrupts it and makes it putrefied, and brings about a great evil after it; and this has already happened in the skull hole, when it is cleaned out by it, especially when the care of it is neglected, with blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore then, if such accidents happen to the sick as we have said, that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness does not happen except from the medicine that is applied on it, and it is in the power of its medicine to make it black: then you should take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a piece of linen cloth; and put it on.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the fracture on the hole: then take care of the fracture with the species of cure that are appropriate, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose does not break except when both of its upper parts break at once, or one of them: for it has two bones: because the lower part is cartilage, it does not break, and it does not happen to it except by friction, and it twists, and it becomes irregular.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the parts breaks, then you should insert a small finger in the nostril and break it with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this with skill.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware that you do not cause pain to him through your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that point with a finger: then it should be evened out with the tip of the little finger where there is a small groove.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that; and repair it on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days when the swelling has subsided a little.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a bit of linen thread into the end of the nose if it has broken in one part; or insert two threads if it has broken in two parts: and let it be so long as to fill the nostril with the quantity that fills the hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some old restoratives say that they should dip the thread in butter and change it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That does not seem right to me, but it should be dipped in chalk powder mixed with flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the thread when the nose has hardened and the cartilage has healed.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a feather of a goose is inserted instead of the thread in the nose after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and so it will hold the fracture more firmly, and not prevent the sick from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	That is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want to do that, then do so: and if you don't want to, then do not do the thread.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That if the nose swells again while you are operating, then put a wisp of grass or a bit of wool dipped in rose oil or a little of the substance called dヤquilo on it.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, there is no apoplexy of the hot type, then it should be made that the plaster itself is mixed with rice flour and the turpentine powder mixed with alum.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a bed of resin on top of it and don't tie the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the nose bones break or crack, then it is necessary to split them open and remove them with the tools that are suitable for this.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then carry out the cutting, and be careful of the flesh that is ingrown and hardened with the plaster suitable for it, or with ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a bone comes between the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with liniments and administer a silver tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	The restoration of the lower jaw when it has been broken.
Caput V.	Chapter 5
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and not joined to the cheek bone: examine it then if the fracture is only of the jaw and does not break into two pieces, and treat it internally: then it is easy to recognize it.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, to insert your index finger of your left hand into the socket: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert your index finger of your right hand: and push it out with ease toward the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and thus adjust it evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the jaw fracture has already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer external pressure from both parts, according to the straight line: until the adjustment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, an injury or rupture has already occurred to the teeth: then tighten them with a golden, silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place pitch on top of the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a double cloth over it and a large wooden block made of skin equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind the wound above, according to how you prepared your ligature, and let the application stay on until it is destroyed; and instruct the sick person to use tranquility and rest; and put food for his consumption that is soft to digest.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that something of the shape has changed by any means: then approach it and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been changed from it with plaster made from ground down wool, or with flour made from sifting, after you have removed the scabs: and place over the plaster a piece of thin linen cloth.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to the wound, and the position of the bones does not change, let go of it, do not loosen it, until it has healed: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened seven times.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If while it is being tightened this warm poultice causes a reaction, then administer to it that which I said many times in the sedative, until it removes that poultice.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now I will tell you if a small fragment has separated from the bone, or is hanging by a thread; then take care in this case, so that you remove those fragments of the thread with it when you prepare the instruments for their removal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the opening of the wound is tight, then widen it with a phlebotomist according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you remove those threads, and none of them remain, then broaden the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place over the wound from the plaster that suits it to make it flesh, until it has healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Regarding the restoration of a fork when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The fork is often broken at the front part from the shoulder, and the fracture of it is made in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is broken and separated into two, except that it happens to be hanging by a thread; and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Thus it is with those who suffer from bone disease; and it is harder to restore them.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, with a fracture of the radius.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation when the fracture is without the ulna, is, that you make these two ministers present, so that one of them holds the assistance which follows the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make your fingers equal as to their length, until they take on the right shape; and do not let them be prominent or crooked.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you wish to extend the length more, then it is necessary that you place under a small ball of cloth or wool; and make its size according to the necessity of your case: and extend it, and press down the fork, and hold the ball with your hand, until the fingers take on the same shape, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you are not able to bring the extremities of the fork to the outside, since it reaches to a depth; then it is necessary that the sick person should lie on his back upon his chest; and place under his shoulder a block or a board, in width, and press down his shoulder by means of a minister at the bottom, until he raises the bone of the fork which is in the depth towards the top: and then, rectify the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a tingling in the fork, and it moves: then it is necessary that you should discover it, and remove the tang from it with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use the incision-making tool which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork an instrument which supports the tang; and that instrument is of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is similar to an ear-shell, which is not crooked.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And make its size according to the length of the bone, and the convenience of your case.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Length indeed also concerns you as much as possible for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other end is tight.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if you have cut the wound that you made when you extracted the bone from the shank, it is wide, and you secure it with warm cautery: then you join together the two lips of the wound with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you time the warm cautery: then fill the bone with wool, and powdery matter according to the amount of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	Which if it happens that the cautery is warm, then you pour wool in olive oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it on the top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The rigor of the bone is, when it is without wound, and without section, is, as you place on the bone a plaster made from milled flour with alum.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And you place a block of wood on top of the bone.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under the tip of it, if you can bear that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a drop of blood, which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and its length is that of one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled powder on top of the block and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an awl from a thin board, whose length is like three fingers, and its width likewise.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the awl in that place of alchemy that falls on the fracture and the spot.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alchemy on top of the fracture as a bandage, and wrap it around the neck, and under the tip of the chin, and below the tip of the sick one: and reduce it on all sides, and so you see that the rigor holds the fracture tight: and this is what does not cover you over, and all around, so that it does not move the awl from above the bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary that you observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligaments become softened, and you see that the joint has already become loose: then straighten that, and tighten the ligaments.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the patient to sleep on his back, and place under his head a pillow near his ears, in the night, so that he may have aid from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	So let the fracture of the forearm be healed by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loose the ligaments, if it does not happen in place of accident from itching or from rust, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then tie again the plaster, if you see the face of him towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the tightening, and let him go, until he is healed and has clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the forearm is tightened and supported after fifty days: and sometimes it happens in some men with less.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the spoon.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spoon rarely breaks, and in its wide place: and it does not break from it except the edge of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it breaks from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known that except by touch: then according to what it is in shape, prepare the treatment for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it back to its natural form by all the skill of your ability.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put over that place with a powdered thing that is made smooth by the chaff of wheat, and a block of wood, and put on a cloth of twofold linen.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put over him the flat board from a thin table according to the quantity of the spoon of all, or larger than that by little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if under the board is there a crack of the spoon in any place, then make that crack equal to the chaff with a smooth block, until it descends the board according to the equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then spread the skin over the top, long, constrictively fitting, and firm, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whatever time it is that the ligament softens, tighten it, and if the skin moves from its place: let the sick lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then solve the ligament: and you are secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For this very reason it is that the joint is not feared, nor is its release.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from a bone fragment, and stings under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what I said about the fracture of the mandible with a hot seat-warmer, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities, however, are most frequently broken, and they are destroyed by its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it is broken in the middle, which declines towards the lower parts, and there occurs a very painful pain, difficulty in breathing, and perhaps blood spitting, and a breach becomes visible in the broken bone, and does not remain concealed: its restoration is so that the sick one lies on his back: and place it between the spatula.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders together, and gather the ribs on either side with the hands: and gently adjust its alignment, in any way that is possible, making it right: unless it returns to its shape, according to which is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place over it a cushion and a blanket, and put above it an astellan from a thin board of oak, or ash, and similar ones in buoyancy, after you have wrapped it up in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then, with a sharp knife, bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and sometimes, when the ligature becomes roundish, turn it around to the back and tighten it slightly.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ligature at all times, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if need requires to remove it from the place of the wound, or if there is corruption that has occurred in that place, or pain, or swelling: then approach and remove it, and cut off the plaster, and correct what has happened with the method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see towards it: and attach the ligature to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Of the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a break in the ribs does not occur, unless in the large spaces that follow the back, and from the ends of them from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer from rubbing, except for this reason, because they are cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense in inquiry with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is done so that an even fracture is made with the fingers according to a possible manner, until it is even in shape, according to which it is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then bind the bone and tighten it with a splint, if you need it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is to the inside: then it happens that there is a sharp pain, and a prickling, like that which happened to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pricks the membrane, and also he experiences difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood spitting up: and this is a difficult treatment.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancient people have devised many devices for it: and from these are those who say, as you put food that generates inflammation and ventosity, so that the belly inflames, and extends, and pushes the fracture to the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We do not want to hurry, so that there is no cause for a hot aposteme, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If it has already happened, then add it into it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And someone among them said: Let it be placed on a flowing place, and then suck with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, they are afraid that the flows will attract flottations to the place, because of the weakness of disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And someone among them said: It is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let them put feathers between the sides, until it is filled up: so that the bond is equal when it is turned according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then take care of the sick with poultices from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if it hurts the sick thing, which it does not tolerate, and pricks the mouth with a scar that hurts, and we are afraid over the sick one: then it is necessary that we split on the place, and detect from the side that is broken.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put on her a tool that preserves siwach, of which the memory precedes: and let us cut the mouth with ease, and let us cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather two lips of the wound, if it is large with a stitch: and let us take care of him with plasters, until he heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	That if the hot aposteme happens while it is happening, then come on, and pour feathers in rose oil, and put them on the place: and take care of the sick one with it that suits the apostema.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime, he also lies down on his side where he sleeps, until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	The restoration of a broken spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Head
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	However, when a bone of the neck has happened to fracture, and rarely happens to it that it is worn out: and also for the spine of the back and neck.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Then when it has happened to someone, and you want to know if he heals, or not, then trust.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see his hands already softened, stunned, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor stretch them out, nor compress them; and when you compress them with your fingers, and prick them with an aiguille, he does not feel that, nor does he feel pain in them: then you will know that it is not healing, and it is mortal in many cases.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	That if he moves them and feels constriction with your fingers and pricks: then you will know that the spine of the bones is healed, and that the sick will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if he becomes like the spine of the back in his shape, and you want to know if it heals as well or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they have softened, and that which happens in his hands also happens in his feet: then when he lies on his back, he walks with a wavering and without willingness: and when he raises himself on his stomach, he walks without unwillingness: and when he raises himself on his back, and wants to drink, and cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not undertake to heal him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing of this happens to him, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the healing that happens from this is such that you put oil on a sore back: so that you put it on a shredded horse: or when you rub it in.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place it over that several times a day until he sits down with a sore blister: then place it on a place of supporting plasters, drying up, and紧緊地绑在上面用绳子：然后命令病人静静地休息。
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the part where he feels pain until it heals.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	That if something happens to the bone as a blister, or something that has already separated from it: then it is necessary that you cut off the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather up the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then heal yourself with some ointment, from the unguentarium, until you are well.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If it is ultimately broken, however, the bones of the foot and the heel: then you should, as you introduce your left hand's thumb into the anus, and your right hand's hand, as possible, and by second nature: and by equalizing them.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over it, and take it away: and heal the wound with the cure that preceded it, until it is well.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	The Restoration of Ankles.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones break in the ankles.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then their fracture is not, unless it is broken at the extremities of them: and they split along their length, and lean towards the inside: and happens to the foot an ache in the place, and a prickling: and the leg freezes when it breaks.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration thereof is, that you should extend your hand over it, until you stand on top of the fracture, just as it is in the figure of it.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in its extremities alone, then make it equal, according to which it is prepared for you out of equality, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is along its length, or has already leaned towards the inside: then let the sick person lie on his back, until the restoration of its fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made it equal, then place over it a plaster: and then place over it an wooden staff, or a skin: and tighten it with a firm tension so that you do not move the fracture, nor remove the staff.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And the equal concavity of them with that by which it fills it, until you take it by means of a firm tension according to equality: and command the sick person, that he should lie on his back, or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if his wound is warm: then stop the spread of it, and restore him, until the warmth of the wound subsides: and place something above it that will support it, according to what preceded it; then return to its restoration; and bind it tightly as is right.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if he has a broken bone, or it is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	For the restoration of a fracture, ask for an assistant.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the knee and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it is broken, then its restoration is according to two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind together with two ties at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from a raised place: and let the sick one sit on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches its joint, in which place sits the little piece of wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang it from above the sick person something heavy so that he extends himself by the aid of a servant below.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor shall adjust the fracture with his hands simultaneously, until he has restored the fracture; according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other mode is that the sick person lies on his back on his pillow: and let his hand be suspended from his neck with a strap.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two servants, that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other hold below him, and each one extends to his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if it is a knee, so that the extension is stronger, then tie a strap under the fracture, and above it with another strap: and let each of the two servants extend to their sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	But if the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it should be: that one tie is placed under the joint, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if the fracture is near the elbow: then it should be placed, so that ligaments are put on that place, and also on the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then the fractured bone should be made equal with ease without work, until such time as it is made equal according to what is necessary, and applied by good application: then tighten it, if it does not happen that a warm apoplexy occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If on the other hand a warm apoplexy occurs, then let the tightening be discontinued until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on top of it a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and olive oil, until such time as the apoplexy subsides: then tighten it: and the mode of tightening it is that you put a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an unguentation of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he should grind the arm on a board, and put his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put a cloth, and tighten over the helper arm, so that the arm stays in place with the help of the supports: if it does not prevent you from doing so, nor should anything change on top of you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That if the time comes when something changes on top of you from the broken bone, then use supports: and it is that you put on top of the fracture a support which is wider and stronger than the other supports.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And put between all the supports a distance of a finger: and let the length of the supports be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the supports with the tightening which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your tightening should be stronger over the place of the fracture than yours.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And to the extent that the fracture is elongated, the tightening is less strong.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see that the supports of the supports and the tightening are in place, as we have said, at the time when you restore the member: then do it: and if you see a warm apoplexy, then discontinue the tightening and the supports until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Afterwards, examine the ligament for three days, so that there is no itching or swelling at the site, nor does food reach the member, due to the excess stiffness.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So, make the whole thing straight according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are confident that nothing will come from it: then do not open the ligaments until after three days, or longer.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the nurse lie on her back and put his hands on her stomach, and place under the pillow a stuffed pillow filled with wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the broken member does not unfold, nor do the ligaments become softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	So, make the whole thing straight with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the nurse according to the order we have set out, so that there is a light meal first, until the mouth begins to tighten: then it should become fattening food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of the assistant and the limb is that it be tightened for forty days: so then it should be loosened, and given a bath, and treated with ointment that straightens it out.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture has become rotten and worn away: then do not open the ligaments and stars from it until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII. On the treatment of a broken arm.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is made up of two bones called the two heads.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and this is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and this is that which is placed beneath the little finger on the lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps, therefore, the bone in one part alone breaks, or the other, and perhaps both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	But when the bone breaks above on the small side, then the restoration of it is easy, and its recovery easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the bone breaks below on the large side, it is a bad break, and its recovery difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones break at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is not very far above, then it is good for the doctor to go to its restoration, so that he can put an extension on it with ease, until it is equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the broken bone is big: then it should be, so that he puts a stronger splint on it quickly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to put the hand in a position at its restoration, and its extension over the little finger.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be placed higher than all the fingers; and the articular lower part of all the fingers, or other than that; and the injured sitting on a square behind himself, and the little finger before him, or directly in front of him, at height, so that the injured does not suffer pain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let it be extended by the arm from the lower side, or with its own hand, or with a strap.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another helper should extend from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor sets the bone, until he reduces it to a better form than he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are any fragments in the fracture of the bone, then you shall strive to reduce any fragment to its place with your own strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if it seems to you that there is a separate fragment sticking out through the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find under it, and remove it according to the mode which we have said before in those which precede these.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with the wrist, I have already done for that particular caputulum, so you take the cure of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If it happens in the beginning of your restoration that there is a hot swelling, then take a thin cloth made of linen, wet with oil that has been seasoned with white wax, and white powdery stuff, and put the middle between the thickness: and tightly tie the cloth on the bone, until when he sits down the swelling goes away: then remove the cloth, and put a pre-made patch made of powder that is finely ground with linen thread.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on stars, and let there be a star which is placed over the fracture itself a little wider, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you shall know that the number of stars of the arm is six in various dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one hand, or in two hands together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your bandage over the site of the fracture a stronger and more robust one, and somewhat more with the bandage of its upper fracture, or its lower: or put on a softer bandage somewhat according to what has preceded it at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths that are wrapped around the fracture, soft, moist: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is tied from linen itself, middle between thin and thick, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and its ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	That if something should happen in which correction is necessary, such as itching that happens to a limb: then it should be, to immerse the limb in hot water, until that itch ceases, and remove the bandage not constricted, until it has ceased, and then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	That if the bandage is already softened, and the bone has already moved away, and such things: then correct it all with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nutrition is prevented from reaching the limb, because of excess bandage, then it should be, to make the body somewhat softer, and remove it for a few days, until it has healed to the body's nutrition, and then tie it up.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if any of those things that we have said does not happen to the limb, then it is not necessary to untie it, unless after twenty days, or around these.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang up the injured arm by its side.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let the neck be equal, and guard it with your skill from moving.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it will be restored in fifty-nine days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this depends on the state of the wound's closure and the state of healing strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Of the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the wrist and knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him, unless there is much friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When then a fracture occurs in the foot, or from much friction: then it is necessary that the sick man should be seated at ease; and before him there shall be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on top of it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon shall extend the broken bones and make them even; and let the doctor join them together when they are well joined together.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he should put plaster and a bandage, if there does not occur a warm blister.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put the plaster above from the quantity of the place; and you have already wrapped it up in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is lower around the ankle of the foot, then make a sphere-like shape from cloth; and order the sick man to put his hand on top of it with his broken foot: and then bind it with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let there be a splint made of linen cloth, on which sits something soft, to apply the cloth to the body of the foot: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary: that you put the splint above and a splint from below on the foot: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put a bandage, as it is extended; and extend it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	That if a fracture occurs in someone's knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, make it even according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the plant: and if you wish, put a straight stake on it, so that the fracture may be held in place and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the middle, or in the index, or in the ring finger, then it should be made equal and bound to the healthy finger that follows it: or all should be bound according to the continuity: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a stake on top of it, as we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that preparation of the wound: and oppose with it what should be opposed, when anything happens from it, according to what it goes back to its story.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	[On the Restoration of the Fracture of the coxae.]
Caput XV.	Chapter XV
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks and is felt because it turns towards the inner and back part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of it is so that one binds ligaments above the fracture, and a ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the invalid will stretch out on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he extends all the ligaments towards his side according to equality: and this is when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the coxae, then let there be a ligament on the side towards the pelvis, so that it falls up: and a ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in the same way if there is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a nearby ligament of the knee, so that it falls down: and a ligament below the fracture.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor makes the bones of both his hands equal, until he reduces them according to their natural shape: and the joints are joined together.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you put a cast on it and tighten it up, if it does not happen to the appendage.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	What if something happens in that appendage: then you should let go of it for a few days, until the heat of the appendage has subsided: and then come back to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	But let his scar be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	But you should wrap a strapping cloth around the fracture; that is, a bond: and double it twice or three times; and leave off from it what is excessive.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap up the leg, until the heel has joined the heel bone.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg close to the knee from below, and bring the ends of the thread from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap up the leg and thigh that which is excessive with the strapping cloth.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on the place of the fracture itself the stars; and put one star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill up the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft cloth, so that the tightness is equal.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with the strong middle of the three or four wound-bindings at the place of fracture.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And if you lengthen more by means of the rope from the place of fracture, your tightness will be less and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then extend to both ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	So bind with the two stars that are on top.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then move with both ends of the thread to the bottom, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And bind also the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the wound-binding does not move away from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then remove the tightness from that when it remains, so that corrosion does not happen to the limb, nor swelling, nor inflation, and similar to these.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something should happen to any of those things.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	So arrange with the solution of that, and set right what has happened from there all, as often as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a piece of bone has come out of the bone that hurts: then it is necessary to make it equal, if you can do it.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find on that, and remove it: and take care with what preceded it, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture is tightened, besides adding pegs to it, as we have said in the adiutorium and brachium.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But verily in restoring it thus fractured, there does not occur a limp disease.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides applying the other leg to him, then he must necessarily limp always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip is tightened in fifty days, or a little added, or a little massaged: all of this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	The restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that a fracture rarely occurs in the kneecap, but it often occurs to him by abrasion.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if a fracture has actually occurred, then either there is a crack, or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with an injury, and without an injury.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he will stand on top of that with all his might.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that he equals what has been broken from his parts with fingers, until he sets it together, and joins it according to what is possible by way of equitation and facility, and manufacture.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on plaster from wheat flour, or grind it with egg white: and put on top of it a round peg, if you can bear that one: and tighten it tightly with a fitting instrument to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have mentioned in the other fractures: such as feverishness and its like: so that you oppose every accident to him who belongs to him, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	The restoration of a fracture of the limb.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones in the limb, of which one is large and is called the femur, and the other is fine, and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both species of fracture that occurs in two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is done as the equal restoration of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones break at the same time, the crack spreads to all parts of the body.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a smaller bone breaks, the crack spreads to the front part of the body.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a larger bone breaks, it injures what is below it: and it is from these that you do not see.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer the extension, and the normalization, and the binding of the sternum according to that which is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the Crus is a bad fracture, it has many complications: let there be less extension, and milder relief for you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the Crus there is a certain operation on the arm: and it is, as when you equalize the hinges, and complete all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which is used in the making of the joints that are placed under the tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them those that have a small thickness, and there are none from the minute ones: and let their length be according to the length of the Crus from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap around a piece of cloth twice, on either side, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one side of the Crus from one side, and the other from the other: and they are from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	Since the tightening is prohibited, the Crus tilts to the right and to the left, and stands firmly.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now allow a piece of wood to be administered according to the length of the Crus, and place it on so that it keeps it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And much more should you do, that you make it in the fracture when it is its own proper uulnus.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the Crus every day, and study with it the last resort from aching, or swelling, or any other thing.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	And if then something happens from them, then oppose it with him that it should not happen again until it is healed, if God wills.Et si Crure est fractura foeda, et non potest sanetur in diebus aliquo: tunc ad tuum opus oportet ut illud exspectes donec tu facias, aut quod alter faciat qui potuit
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the foot and the toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII. On the fracture of the bones of the foot
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The fracture of the calcaneum does not occur within the bone itself.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The fractures of the bones of the foot, and of the toes, do indeed occur sometimes, and the fracture of the toes occurs but little; but it does not happen to them except through abrasion in many directions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture should occur in the bones of the foot, and if you see those bones disjoined from one another, then let the sick person place his foot on the ground prepared for walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and set your foot upon that which is raised from those bones; then press it, or trample on it; and make it even, until it comes back into its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then set a plaster upon it, and cover it with a cloth; and place under the foot a thin panel which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it closely to the foot as you walk with it, having wrapped it with cloths, and leave it there until it has been healed over by the bandages.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore they have passed the time of three or four days, then dissolve the ligatures.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones even if they are not broken, or if they are broken and dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation then is upon them as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any of the toes are broken, then restore them, and make even all the toes according to what you tell me in the restoration of the toes of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger upon an Astragale according to the length of the finger, and make it a little broader; then place under the foot the panel which you told me to prepare for you, and bind it closely to the foot as you walk with it.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, the fracture has occurred among the bones which are two or three or more, then place upon each finger an Astragale of its own quantity, wrapped in a cloth; and bind the panel beneath the foot, standing on one head of the panel outside the foot as you walk with it: and let the sick person hold the panel by the hand so that he will keep his balance well.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is proper that you not forget, unless you remember all that I said to you in the remaining fractures from the accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of the female gender, and the ribs of the chest, and the male gender for the male gender.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's hip is fractured, then let her sit in a squatting position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly towards the back of herself and hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill the woman's womb, until she is filled: and let it be made in the female gender from that like a ball.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then shake the woman, and support her back slowly.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	That coccyx should be removed, until it is in front of the woman' s door like a ball, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a small pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she therefore wants to urinate, remove the coccyx with ease, then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the manner in which you introduced it in the first place: and then return to her little pillow first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let that be done for seven days, or about, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you want, take a smooth stick, and tighten it over the hole of her tube, and insert the entire smooth stick into the woman' s womb.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the smooth muscle bends inside the womb, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with a coccyx, and let it stand for several days, according to what we have mentioned, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the rib of a man or woman is fractured, then administer to its restoration, and that which we have mentioned regarding the bone of the ankle.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which happen little, especially in those who have some kind of study, or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for it signifies to you many things concerning the straight way of rest and contraction. Understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	And when the rod of a man is broken, take the throat of a goose; and insert the virgate into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put a bandage over the wound, and let it be wrapped up; and leave it for three days, or something like that, and he will be healed, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	For the restoration of broken bones, when it is with an arrow.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting that he who has had a fracture with an arrow, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone or the pelvic bone, or similar to it, as you think fit, and draw blood immediately: if you are allowed to draw blood, as we have said above.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	That if the arrow spatters blood, then you should cut off its ends, so that it settles on the top of the wound in dust: if there is not another for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in him on the same day; and do not put off doing it, if there is no swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a swelling is hot, then dismiss the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the swelling subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you will do him harm.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if a bone is broken above the skin that has been discovered: then you should seek to reduce it, and make it level with your hands with ease and small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if its extension is not prepared, and its leveling with your hands: then reduce it with a chisel.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is an instrument made of iron, the length of which is the number of seven or eight fingers; and its width according to the measure of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this it is necessary for a physician to take three or four according to the measure he needs for that healing in all kinds of fractures.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small bulkiness within it, so that it does not double up on itself under pressure from above during the operation; and let the acute extremity be, to which there is a margin at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be placed above it by half its width down to its lower extremities.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the shape of it.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary that the acute extremity be curved over the prominent bone end: and push it with a single force until the bone returns and becomes equaled to some degree.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore take care to make the ends of the fracture face each other at an angle.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its ends are fragile, and does not accept it well, then you must, to strike the end of its bone, until the instrument can have power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them at all with the means we have described, then strike it with one of the knives that we mentioned: or clamp it down using a clamp in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then rasp what remains on the bone from its roughness and small fibers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced, and finds itself after its reduction in a painful, irritating position, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Then do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer a great advantage of healing when you complete the restoration that you are making to the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in black vitriol wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And particularly if it is in the summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place anything on the wood of the bed, or any oil: so that it does not happen in it that decomposition and corruption take place.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the following at the time of your supplement to the restoration of the bone:
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And remove the bedpost: so that you strike with the pincers a hole in the second degree of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And with all caution, do not tie the tendon with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many doctors have done this foolish thing; and they have caused injury to their patients or death or corrosion or putrefaction, that is, disease.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your tendon should be soft, gentle, different in tension from the remaining tendons of the fracture.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if the tendon is bad or large, and you wait for some bad accident that we have described, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not appropriate that you should put a splint on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them solutions from hard towels in the place of the splints, and tighten it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one day or two days, and you see the tendon beginning to generate pus, then remove the towel that you put on the tendon with the splint.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply the poultice, and the oils with which we are accustomed to treat wounds: such as the four-part ointment, and others like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the tendon every morning and evening until it has healed and become whole again.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus can flow out of it easily to the bottom.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	That if there pass many days for the wounds and they do not heal, nor does the pus flow away from them: then you should know that there are small bones in them.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why it is necessary to inquire about the tendon with the splint on.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those small bones are separated, remove them, and take them out themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those are not separated, and hurt the limb, and cause injury to it, and remove them in any way that is possible for you that one.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	That if an accident of the tendon occurs, or ekileten, that is to say, tendon torn off, or any other type of corrosion and putrefaction: then it is necessary to oppose each one with what is appropriate for its cure, which preceded it in description in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this it is necessary that my speech stand, and you bring your present mind when the jaw breaks, and comes out over the limb, like the hip bone, and the helpers, and those of them from great limbs, so as not to suspect his attraction, for many times death has occurred from him, besides letting go until he putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps, indeed, it will fall down by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, therefore, take care of the wound, if it remains with you: otherwise, let go of him.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the cure of a nodulation in the shadow of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This Nodulation has often occurred in the shadow of the cure of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the joints: and it grows out of that limb's shape.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it deterrents the limb from its natural action.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore then, if the nodulation is new: administer to it medicines that have a tightening effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and cedar resin, and acacia, and those like them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, that you take some of these certain ones, or all of them: and bind them with a strong staunch, or with white of eggs, or with vinegar: and place them over the nodulation in a poultice, and紧紧地绑在上面，直到它收缩得很好。
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And let go of the stiffness, and do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then, when you have washed it off, and repeated it another time, until the nodulation disappears.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a leaden strip of lead-plaster.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead is indeed the property to remove anything that is feared from the limb.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodulation has already turned into a stone, and is stiff, and there is a need to remove it quickly: then find on top of it a little bit of the blade, and strike off the surplus: or cut it off with some rasps, until it comes off: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When cure is brought about when a member remains after it, not in accordance with its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Title: On the Restoration of Health; When Cure Is Brought
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a broken bone has healed and there remains a deformity, then it is not good for that member unless it is for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is that there is a multitude of ligaments and the ligation thereof not according to what is right; or because of the redundancy of the stricture of the ligaments, until such time as nourishment runs to the member: or because of the number of emetic substances in an inappropriate time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body and the weakness thereof.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is, to nourish the sick and weak body, and to make it strong, until there is an increase of blood in it.
Et administra balneum.	And to apply a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a poultice on the member: that it may draw towards it much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply the emetic frequently with warm water until nourishment runs there and returns to its own shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the Restoration of Fractured Bones when they become crooked.
Caput XXIII.	Title: On the Restoration of Fractures; When They Are
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member has been restored after its sanation is completed and there is a prominent bone fracture or a deformity, and the form of the member is established; nevertheless, the member should not be prevented from its natural function: then you should not take issue with what it exists, that the member be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there were also many doctors and surgeons in our land who did so.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	This operation is most remarkable, driving to death or great fear, as if it were deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the claudication and deformity are recent: then it is fit that they be applied with warm water in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as the leaves of aloe, and its root, and meletium, and others like them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for him a plaster with a soft plaster, as the dyacheta decener is made.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let there be taken the mucus of the root of the althaea, and let it be mixed with the fat of a chicken, or with oil of sesamum; and let it be applied to him.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let there be taken young fig-trees, and let them be crushed with the ash of columba (holly), and similar substances which are called by the name of medicines that decrease consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the swelling has been relieved by careful, old-fashioned, and gentle friction with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the member have movement in all directions at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the tortuosity has already come and is firm, and has gone round about into a stone, and there is a need to treat it with iron: then it should be cut off above, and the continuation of the bone should be healed, and that which comes from the torture or the bone with fine incisors: and ease should be given to him with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the treatment of dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of certain joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why it is prevented by its own motion, and is supported in its figure.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes painful hurts and severe wounds to the weak.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	So when a dislocation has occurred, then one should hurry to restore it: and should not be late in doing so at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if he is delayed, the place will become stiff, and there may very well be a reduction of the dislocation with him.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it should not be necessary for him to move or stretch out in the hour of his delay.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this has occurred, then you should go to have the wound dried up.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is dismissed, until it is at rest.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	The member should then be washed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	It should then be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the member should be curbed with that which will bring back its memory to its own place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, also as regards what preceded it in fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated unless by rare chance.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And there are two ways in which the jaw-dislocation occurs.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they may move slightly from their places by a slight distance and become slightly loosened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely and perfectly, until they become loosened to the rib-side, until the tear is drawn out by nursing, and cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue hangs loose with a lisp.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation is slight, then it returns of itself to many positions with little difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete and perfect: then it is necessary that the reduction thereof should be made quickly, and without delay: and it is as though to hold the head by the side with a bandage: and the doctor should insert the thumb of his hand into the root of the jaw-dislocation between its mouth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or insert both thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand should be placed outside, with which he will equalize it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to clean his jaws, and allow them to eat by all means.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor will equalize the jaw, and push it forward, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	That if the reduction thereof is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together: then administer a steam with warm water and oil until the reduction of the jaw-dislocations becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the jaw-dislocations in any way, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	And so, when they have returned and become equal, and the bone has been sutured, and they have not softened: then place on them small towels, with a sponge that is made from wax: and with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then tie it up easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient lie on his back: and let his head be between two towels so that it does not move to the right or to the left: and let him not sniff or bite anything: but his food should be soft for him to eat, until he has recovered from the pain, and his jaw has been allowed to move: then he should eat what he wants, and give it to him easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Do not cause pain in his mouth during the meal and drinking, and his breathing, until his jaw has healed;
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are displaced at some time, and do not return to their places: then frequent fever occurs from there, and persistent pain: and the stomach may be sore, and pure cholesterol may escape.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So when you see this: then know that it is a loss, and often he dies who experiences this in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Of the reduction of a fracture of the cleaver and the limb of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The cleaver does not dislocate from its inner side due to its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates when it is pushed outwardly: and gives a sense of movement.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that he lie on his back, and stretch out his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then wrap the place with your palm firmly, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place on it a sponge, and towels, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of the limbs that follow the bed, and continue with it, do not dislocate unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is displaced on one day: then let it be reduced and made equal as we have said, and let you be prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put on over it an ointment, and pulli, and a strap.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the sick to adhere to tranquility and quietness until they are healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it is separated from its place also.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	De reductione dislocationis humeri:
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is such that it dislocates towards the side of the tickle directed downward.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Of which second is such that it dislocates towards the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus, and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And does not dislocate toward the back due to the shape of the spine.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And does not dislocate toward the front due to the presence of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Indeed, it most often dislocates and moves downward toward the side of the tickle: above all, in those whose flesh is thin.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it moves out of these quickly, and enters them quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is thick, on the contrary, it moves, namely because it goes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps in some people there is a knock or a fall, and the humerus is dislocated by means of heat, and it is thought that because of this it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, let it be so that you test that, until you are certain about its effect, and then proceed to its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And know the dislocation when it is directed downward toward the tickle: and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a great difference between them, and when the base of the clavicle has come together, and under the tickle near the touch of the head of the humerus it seems to be itself; and the sick cannot reduce their hand to its place, neither can they move it in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then the injury is evident to the touch and cannot be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this dislocation it is easy to reduce when it is recent or when the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that he raises his hand towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under the tickle of him, and raise the joint with force towards the upper part to its place; and the minister shall lift up his hand, and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down, for he himself will quickly turn it around.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not turn around by that which we have said, and it is a long time since the dislocation occurred: then it should be, that the sick person bathes in warm water, and an emollient is administered which softens and soothes, such as if radishes of aloe, and fenugreek, and mallow are crushed in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person shall lie on his back: and let a sphere and wool be placed under him, which is equal between the soothing and the tightening.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor shall place his heel on the sphere, and shall draw down the shoulder with force, and shall lift up the hand of the nurse to the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister shall hold the head of the nurse so that she does not move towards the lower parts: for he himself will quickly turn around.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this mode: and it is such, that the longer sick man stand on one side, and his shoulder be brought under the tickle of the nurse: and raise the tickle of her towards the upper part, until the sick person hangs in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	Then another minister shall hold the hand of the nurse towards the lower parts of his leg.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is lighter: then it should be, that he is suspended with something else, so that he turns himself around: for the dislocation turns him around immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another mode: and that is, so as to be figurated in the earth a long piece of wood, the head whereof is round figure: as the hand of the mortar: which is neither thick nor fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place under the sick one after they have been placed on top of the head of the wood a thin cloth: and the sick one stands according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended to the lower part from the other side, and his body is extended from the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and that is, take a piece of wood the length of two arms, and its width the width of four fingers, and its thickness the width of two fingers: whose head is round, so as to relieve the entrance into the profundity by titillation, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then they are bound on top of the round head with thin cloth, so that it does not hurt the wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place under the titillation the sick one, so that his hand or arm extends over the wood to the lower part: and bind the wood on either side of the aid and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the step by the breadth of it, and extend the hand to the lower part, and dismiss the remaining body suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entry is complete according to any possible mode: then you should place under the sphera of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the preparedemplastrum made of molendinum flour and incense, and albumen spread over all the shoulder as it turns upside down.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten under the titillation with a tightening that comes down: and it is relaxed by the joint on the sphera: and he joins his hands to his neck, and dismisses them, and does not move them for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	It is necessary that food be given to the sick man, until his member is healed; for it is swifter in its recovery.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then let him be given more food after seven or five days, and let him be exercised with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If he then remains stable and does not become softer, then he is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the joint dislocates frequently, on account of the moisture that occurs with it, or on account of some other cause: then it is necessary that he should receive a cauterization with three holes, according to what has been stated in the chapter On Cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	That if this is done entirely, and the ligaments are healed after seven days, and the dislocation does not occur, and the poultice and stricture are applied several times to it, and it does not harden, and it falls, and he cannot raise it up towards the upper arm: then you should know that the nerves which are in the shoulder-blade have been cut, or stretched out, or softened: and you should know that the dislocation never sets in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation which takes place opposite the breast and the nipple, or towards the rear, takes place with an impulse and extension with the hands; until it has returned, and a remaining stricture and care is received on it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	That if anything happens after healing with a weight in the member, and slowness in its motion, then the sick person should often use the bath until that weight is softened, and he returns to his natural state first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	HEAD XXXIX.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the dislocation of the elbow joint occurs with difficulty, and in a similar way it returns with difficulty; and it itself dislocates to all sides, chiefly to the front or to the rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you; for it falls under the sense of hearing, and under the sense of feeling, according to whatever figure it dislocates.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the broken bed with a healthy one, let that be manifest to thee.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint will be dislocated, and the arm cannot be doubled, nor can it touch its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must act promptly to reduce the dislocation before a warm apoplexy occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a warm apoplexy has occurred, it is difficult to reduce it; and it is likely that it will not heal at all, especially when it is behind the shoulder.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in every respect to the dislocation, and more painful to that pain; and often dies with her.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And when her recovery is from those things that can be reduced, let it be that she extends her hand with two hands; and let her arm be stretched out, and her fingers above the bed and below it, and herself push the dislocation with her thumbs of her hands at once, or with the root of her palm, until she comes back to her place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or, on the other hand, the dislocation is to the front; then she returns so that she doubles her hand with her own hand, until she hits against the shoulder which has been dislocated with the root of her palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not obey the dislocation to reduction, then administer a painful and strong extension; and let it be that two ministers extend his arm: and let them hold him also so that he does not move when extending.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm turns around to all parts after it has been rolled over her hand with a long, double cloth, or with a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the dislocation with his own hand, he should rub it with oil so that it is from those things that help the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then push the dislocation with a painful thrust until it comes back.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after reducing her, it should be placed on her a plaster, in which is staphylization and drying with chalk, and it should be strained by tightening as it goes down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck by the nurse; and let it be taken away after some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be removed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint remains firm in its own place, then loosen the ligaments from it, and let it go itself.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not tightly strung, then renew the plaster and the ligament, and let it go after some days until it is tight.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then let it be removed.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, the weight of the patient causes trouble after the joint has been reduced and is in motion: then administer dampening in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression until it heals, or place it on the joint with an iliac poultice, that is, with nettle leaf.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be tied up and let it go itself over night and day.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it off, and let the patient enter the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When then he sweats, then rub the joint gently.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then change it three times with oil while entering the bath until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you want, put on top of it a paste made from hay, moist, warmed with butter, and tightly strung over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Make it then after some time.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it heals itself and returns to its own position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	The treatment of a dislocation by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Mahassem often dislocates, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, the joints of the other limbs are difficult to reduce.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed be in the reduction of his dislocation at the hour when he dislocates, before the apposition of the warm: or that it happen to him during a warm apposition.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of his dislocation is such that he lays the weak hand on a table, and extends the hand of the minister; and lays the doctor's hand on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it back until it comes back into place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manos, tunc sit positio manos eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manos eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manos medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	Indeed, it should be considered if the palm has already receded to the navel of the hand: then let the sick person place his own back of the hand on the board during extension and reduction: and if dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the person's hand be placed intrinsece on the board, that is, the interior part of his hand over the board, so that the doctor's hand
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he cannot (tolerate) or you cannot (perform the reduction) after a few days have passed, then the joint remains according to its tortuosity: and it does not harm the sick person if his hand becomes softened, and he cannot grasp anything: then you should know that the tendons have been cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Not at all is there talent  (in it), except that it be grasped with a caustic close to its injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not do anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	But since Almahessem did not return, then place on him the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be grasped, and let it be left for five days: then let it be loosened and let it be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its movement is restricted, and something heavy occurs to it: then make it soft with hot water, and sometimes with rubbing, until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	§ On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Haec enim est curatio dislocationis: si
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	This is the treatment of dislocation: if a finger comes out completely from its socket, or from the back of the palm, or from its hollow: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it opposite the part where it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it has healed in that day of its own accord.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When the night comes, bind it according to his story: and do not cease to wash it on that day; and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make it for a few days until it is tight.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with him if he is dislocated at the wrist of the hand: and bind it to the side, and do your first operation with him until he heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with him when he is dislocated in the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocation of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that the spine is dislocated, or many of the Vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of it is that the weakness walks away from him without desire, and cannot hold itself: and many times the limbs become weak on him, or two legs, or two arms of his, or one of them; or a Vertebrae is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For many times the removal is, for many times it happens that they are removed to the four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is removed towards the back is called a hunchback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the cure of it is, so consider then, if a hunchback happens to you from childhood: then there is no cure for it, and from it there is no healing at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which happens from a fall, or a blow, or the like, the ancient men have said long words of the cure of it.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose most does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I however have shortened that from it, of which little excuses a great deal of his nearness to me on purpose: and my exposure of it, I formed an instrument out of him in many ways from him by which they showed it to him, and showed him himself.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I therefore say that in the deformity which has occurred from the front part, there is no talent, nor is there cure for it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which was made on both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it should not be cured from them unless that which happened in the back of its own is told with what I am telling: and it is, so that it extends on its face over a level platform near its wall: and it expands under it a wet cloth, so that its chest does not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight wood should be placed in the foot of the bed in the earth, at the end of the foot, around its head: and another wood around its feet at the other end of the foot: and the servant should hold the wood, and it should not be firm in the footboard.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other servant should hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then the nurse should turn over on her head and under her chin with a soft bandage, firm: and she should extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is at her head: and she should tie herself up in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then a different bandage should be tied above her armpits, and above her knees, and at the joints of her legs.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then all the bandages should be gathered together, and they should tie themselves up in the other wood that is at their feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then the other servant should stretch out to the side of the wood and should not move the two woods from their places, which they are fixed: but they should not be firm, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should put his hands on the spine with strength, until he can turn it: or he should put it on a plate.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should connect his feet to the plate: and he should turn them back.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If he does not turn it back by this cure, then take a plate whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hole in the wall from which we have spoken that is near the sick man, the place where the end of the plate should go in.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the board on top of the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor put his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten it well, until the spinal girdle is in place, and return to your station.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish to operate with a tourniquet that is wound with your hand: and it is so, that you fix in the ground at the head of the patient two beams whose length is equal to the length of an arm: and apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between all the beams be a palm: and now it has been done in every place a hole, in which the tourniquet runs: and all the wood is made firm on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And introduce the round wood: and the tourniquet is in two holes of two beams.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end thereof is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm along with that which turns: and in two other beams also is similar.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligature which you have tightened in the chest of the patient with a tourniquet that is at his head: and the ligatures which you have tightened in his thighs with a tourniquet that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every tourniquet, who tightens his hand with a thistle, with which the tourniquet turns: and the doctor adjusts the spine, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tourniquet which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine has returned to its place and is adjusted, then you should put out dried blood with albumen.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the caulk.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put on top of the dried blood a board from the table, whose width is three fingers wide, or something like that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length be such as to take up the space of the girth, and on the side of the spine healthy.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then bind with a bandage where there is a knot as we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the injured person be nourished with delicate food until he recovers.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains of a disease in the place where it was at the end of recovery: then let those medicines be given which soften and relieve, with the tablet we mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now that lead Tablet is administered to him in his bed.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when it happens that a disease remains at the end of the back bone: and let it be thought that there is a dislocation, and this is the jaw which has already begun to emerge.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should he not be left with this medicine? For it might well happen that death will come about.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	The treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that an ankle sprain and a shoulder joint dislocation do not occur unless there is a complete dislocation; and it does not happen to them what happens to other joints with a small distance apart and with tightness.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the ankle joint dislocates according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it dislocates towards the front and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed, it is most often dislocated inwardly; and little dislocated forwardly and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of this dislocation inward is this: because when you bind a healthy leg to an injured one, it is longer; and the injured leg stands out more than its healthy counterpart, and the injured person cannot bend his knee at the knee; and there is a hot place following the knee joint, so that the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of which happened to be a dislocation outward is that its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of which happened to be a dislocation forward is that it spreads out a healthy leg according to its complement; nevertheless, it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot step forward on it; and he retains his urine, and puts his foot out behind him, and when he walks, he stumbles on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him who has a dislocation at the back, so that he does not spread his knee, and cannot double it until he doubles his hip: and also his leg is shorter on the other side; and the hip is softened, and the head of the thigh is in its place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is so that you consider then, if the dislocation is recent, which has now healed with the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer the reduction of it, and it remains in its position: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	So therefore it should not be assumed that he has a complete recovery.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that one whose dislocation is recent, and there are four types of dislocations: then approach this so that you move the joint, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it to the right and left: perhaps it will come back, and will not need any other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if he does not do this way, then you should prepare a strong tool, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a bandage that is tied above his leg over the knee: and another tool extends his hand from below its tickle, so that he puts his hands under its skin.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he tightens it with a soft bandage over the root of the hip, and holds the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be from the front part of the groin to the side of the thigh, or from the back to the side of the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all their extensions move one way only, until he raises himself up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This type of reduction is a common type of reduction for all four types of dislocations.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If then the dislocation comes back with what I said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for all species that I should say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	For indeed when dislocation is to the inside, it is necessary that the sick one be placed on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then put the ligament over the root of the hip, for it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament to the top from the groin on the side of the body, to the side of the fork.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another minister shall take hold of his strong arms, and shall lessen the large place of the sick hip, and shall extend to the outer side with great movement.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For indeed he has returned to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind of treatment is easier than the other kinds of treatment for the cure of this limb when it is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if he resists you at all when you bring him in with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary that two nurses bind his feet with a strong ligature, soft, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its fellow be four fingers' length: and let the leg of the sick man be drawn out by two fingers' length on the other side.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick one be suspended over the head of the timber that is in the house: and let the length of him from the ground be two arms' length.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong man to hold the head of the hip: and let another suspend the sick one with his back: and let another push him with strength from behind, for the junction returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in the restoration of his own, when there is dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that he lie on his bottom, according to which we have spoken in having a gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the ligament be strung over his own sick leg, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are to be placed, one at his feet, and one at the head of him.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a beam is to be placed in the middle of his foot, well fixed: and let there be laid upon it wet cloths, so that they do not hurt the sick one: and let the beam be between his hips, so that it does not draw towards the lower side at the time of extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let all the surgeons extend to their sides, and the doctor shall make a careful incision with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If he obeys for reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place a table over it, and press it, as we said in the hunchback, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick man lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it should be that the leg of the nurse extends quickly: and it is according to this that he tells it on the platform: and let the doctor place his hand with his right palm over the knee of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then let him stretch it with his other hand, and with that stretching place it extended towards the lower side of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it should not be that the sick person extends towards the lower side, and sits on the ground: but it should be that he is placed on a hard thing, as it also is, and if his hip is dislocated to the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two hips: and it is on his face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that the compression be applied with a table also to the place from which the joint has come out, when the reduction is complete, according to what needs to be done.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his return should not be hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the nurse: and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg, and expands himself without excuse: then you will know that the member has returned, according to what needs to be done: then join the two hips, and put a splint on, and tighten it with an immobile, that is, a rotator: so that it does not move the wide part of any sides: and let the sick person remain calm for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligaments, and the splint, and join the legs together again: then if you see them equal in their state, then you will know that the dislocation has now healed: so let the sick person go out to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything that is softening: then take it off and wrap it up, and tighten it according to your first intention: and also let it go for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen that and make the person walk a little on both sides for a few days, until he is healed.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	The Dislocation of the Knee Joint.
Caput XXXIII.	CHAPTER XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee may be dislocated three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	by the outer side, by the inner side, and by the lower side, that is, by the rear.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that the person will have pain when he applies his knee to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere with the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all types of dislocation is so that the sick person may sit upright, so that he may extend his leg over it and bring his heel to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then fasten the person's knee to your palm, and place your fingers straight over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply your two palms with strength to both sides of his knee.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another person will extend his leg until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then wrap him up, and fasten the leg to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with bandages for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the sick person should not walk for a few days after, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if it does not return to you on its own, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, of which there is a description in the treatment of aching joints, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Ankle Joint.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 32.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus are sometimes dislocated with a slight dislocation and sometimes with a second-degree dislocation.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And this dislocation of the calcanei occurs either internally or externally.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of this dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen and protruding toward the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for this dislocation is easy; it is reduced by extending it with the hands and then making it steady until it is reduced.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	But if you are curing it when it is dislocated second-degree, you should make the sick sit upright; and hold it firmly from the rear part of its back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then grasp it with your right hand from the upper part of its foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of its foot, near the nail.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then drag the foot toward you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand and push the chest of the foot toward the leg with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot toward the leg with your left hand in a third push, and pull off the nail with your right hand.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it then returns with a slight force or two, and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it: for it will recover.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is forbidden to you to reduce it with the method we have described: then let the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and place a firm nail firmly on the ground so that he falls between his knees: and now you have wrapped a cloth around him, so that he does not hurt himself.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take the sick person's leg: then the other assistant extends it with his hands or with a band that is tied around the leg at the knee.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then all the attendants shall stand against his extension, and a nurse shall hold him between two thighs, so that his body is not drawn downward during extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician shall adjust his hands, and another attendant shall hold his leg from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When, therefore, the dislocation returns, and you find that he has recovered his health: then place a splint and a strap, and tighten it with ligaments, and tie the foot to the leg with a ligament.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you be cautious or afraid of the nerves, which are above the heel, after the calcaneus posterior, so that they are not torn by a harsh ligament and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	Which if the ligament becomes soft, tighten him up: then solve him on the third day, or fourth: and prohibit the sick from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he attempts to walk before that space, there is no security except that the dislocation is dissolved, and it corrupts, and does not receive cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	Which if he should have a swelling that is hot: then you shall administer to him in a sedation that which we have spoken of elsewhere in the cure, and a poultice, until it cools down.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of the dislocation of the digits of the foot, and its cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter LXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that he should be adjusted which is dislocated from them with a little extension without work: and this is not difficult, it is even easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some of the nodes of the dorsal foot: then it is necessary that he should make the sick foot stand on an equal place of the earth, or on a board: and it stands as one who walks.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you shall stand still, and put your foot on that which protrudes from them by the joint.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then, with your foot, hit that calcified bone with force until it turns red, and the surface becomes even, and no eminence appears in that place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then, place under the foot's sole the plate that catches the entire foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then, tighten it with a ligature for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then, solve it, and allow it to rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	In regard to the species of dislocation with a broken ulna.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this happens, and he chooses to treat and restore it, many times death succeeds: and for that reason, you should not dare topresume over his treatment, which is of this kind, unless you are prudent in the art of long-term use, merciful, gentle, slow, not bold, and arrogant: and use medicines that sit on the warmth of the apices only: and dismiss the sick with divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Except you hope for salvation from destruction with compassion for the severity of the illness, and where there appears to be some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	So consider the reduction of it at once, before the warm apices sit.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the limb returns, according to our instructions, then administer a regime that sits on the apices: and care for the ulna with what suits it from the dry ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a break, and they happen in the bone of the leg that is separated, then consider the removal of them, and do in it what we said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your strength, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: since my prediction has come to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more saving to your body with them in your time.
