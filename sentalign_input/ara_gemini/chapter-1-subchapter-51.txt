Chapter fifty-one on cauterizing the furuncle.
If a furuncle occurs in someone and it is slow to ripen, either because of the agent causing it, or because of the age of the patient if he is old and has little blood, or because of the time,
and you want to accelerate the ripening of the furuncle, then cauterize around it with many small, dot-like cauterizations.
Then leave it, as this will accelerate the ripening.
If you want to treat it with cauterization, then heat the iron which has this shape:
And insert it in the middle of the furuncle until it penetrates the skin.
And let the cautery be from what is below so that the flow of pus is facilitated.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it heals.
