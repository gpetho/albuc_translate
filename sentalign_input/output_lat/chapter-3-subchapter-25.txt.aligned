The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation.

The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back.

As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means.	The ends of the bones extending toward the elbow, connected to it, rarely dislocate. But if it is dislocated on any day, then it should be reduced and aligned as we have said, and what is prepared for you.	0.7704917
Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed.	Then place a plaster over it, along with cushions and a bandage. And instruct the patient to adhere to calm and rest until healed.	0.84251827
By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.	And with this same treatment, the shoulder extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.	0.73555815
