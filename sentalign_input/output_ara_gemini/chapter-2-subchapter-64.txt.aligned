The dalia is a twisted, somewhat convoluted swelling, resembling a cluster of grapes, accompanied by relaxation of the testicles and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.

And in the treatment of this ailment, there are dangers close to what has been mentioned before, but it is necessary to mention the procedure in it as the predecessors did.

Then, make an incision in the middle, a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove the turbid, corrupt humors that have gathered there. Then, treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal over time so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off, and there is no harm in that.	Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it. Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that.	0.7840421
If the dalia affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the testicle does not lack nourishment because of the cutting of the vessels, and thus wither and become useless.	But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.	0.77966
