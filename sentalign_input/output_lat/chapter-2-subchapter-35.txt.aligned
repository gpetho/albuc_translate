On the removal of 'ranula' beneath the tongue. Sometimes there occurs under the tongue a swelling resembling a small frog, which hinders the natural movements of the tongue; sometimes it grows so as even to fill the mouth.

If you see that it is dark or black, and hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer.	If it appears dark brown or black, hard, and lacks sensation, do not touch it, as this could indicate cancer.	0.82108665
But if it is inclined to be pale and has fluid in it, put a hook in it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it all round; and if haemorrhage hinders you while operating apply pounded vitriol to it till the bleeding stops.	However, if it appears whitish and moist, insert a hook and incise it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from all sides. If bleeding interferes with the procedure, apply powdered *zegi* to control it. Then resume the operation until the cyst is fully removed.	0.73159814
Then proceed with your work till all is extracted; then let him rinse his mouth out with vinegar and salt. Then give all the suitable treatment till healed.	Afterward, rinse with vinegar and salt, and continue treatment with appropriate aftercare until it heals completely.	0.7623155
