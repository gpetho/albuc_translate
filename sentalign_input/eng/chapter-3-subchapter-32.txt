 CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO.
On dislocation of the knee.
 The knee is dislocated in three ways; it is dislocated interiorly and exteriorly and inferiorly, that is, posteriorly.
It is never dislocated anteriorly.
The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated.
The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward.
Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place.
The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh.
Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them.
He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.
But if you cannot effect reduction by this method, apply powerful extension by bandages as we have described above for the treatment of the hip, until it goes back.
