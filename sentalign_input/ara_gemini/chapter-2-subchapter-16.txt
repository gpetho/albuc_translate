Chapter Sixteen on cutting the nail and the growth of flesh of the nail beds.
The pterygium is of two types: either nervous, and it resembles a hard, thin membrane.
Or it is non-nervous, resembling a solid white moisture; if iron touches it or you try to take it with a hook, it breaks apart and a hook will not hold in it.
Both types begin from the greater canthus, and they slowly creep until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye.
The method of its removal is that the patient places his head in your lap, then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards.
Then you take a needle and insert into it a hair from the mane of a horse or a cow and a strong thread, and you bend the tip of the needle slightly, and you insert it into the middle of the pterygium and pierce it with the needle, and you tie the pterygium with the thread and pull it upwards.
And you peel with the hair the side of the pterygium that is next to the pupil, as if you are sawing it with the hair to its end.
Then you cut the remainder at the base of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the canthus, lest constant tearing result from its cutting.
And you may pull the pterygium with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, then you peel with the smooth scalpel the edge which this is its picture:
And beware that the scalpel touches the cornea, causing a hernia in it, so the pupil swells.
Then, after the incision, put in the eye some powdered salt or some zinc sulfate suppositories and leave it until the next day, then treat it as needed until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fleshy and you are unable to insert a needle in it, nor fix a hook in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification.
And if you want to excise it, open the patient's eye and take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, in this manner:
Gently scrape the pterygium from above.
If you see that it becomes loose and crumbles, and the scraping has had an effect on it,
then immediately instill into the eye some copper sulfate collyrium, or red collyrium, or powdered salt.
And bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone.
Unless a hot swelling appears in the eye, then leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals.
Then repeat the scraping procedure on it until it heals.
As for a fleshy outgrowth of the conjunctiva, if the outgrowth harms the eye excessively,
then grasp that outgrowth with a hook and cut off some of it.
Do not cut too deeply, lest it cause excessive tearing.
Then instill into the eyes red collyrium or copper sulfate collyrium until it heals.
