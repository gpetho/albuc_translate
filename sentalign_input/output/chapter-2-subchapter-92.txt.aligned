On the cutting over worms generated under the skin, known as bovine disease.	On incision for the worm arising beneath the skin, called 'the cattle disease'.	0.8420917
This disease is called the "bovine disease" in some lands because it often affects cattle. It is a small worm that grows between the skin and the flesh, traveling throughout the body, moving up and down, and can be felt as it moves from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and comes out.	This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle. It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes.	0.83005977
Its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just like worms, serpents, and roundworms in the intestines.	It arises from the putrefaction of certain humours as do worms, round-worms and gourd-worms in the abdomen.	0.83717453
It is feared for its malignancy, as when it travels through the body and reaches the head, it can quickly penetrate the eye and destroy it, which happens frequently.	Part of the harm that may be expected of it is that when it creeps about the body and goes up to the head and reaches the eye it may make an opening in the eye and come out and destroy the eye; this frequently happens.	0.70581007
Therefore, when you want to treat and remove it, it can only be done by tracking its movement and feeling it. Then, tightly bind the area above and below it, make an incision over it, and extract it.	If you wish to treat this and extract it, it must be done while it is creeping about and can be felt. You must tie a tight tourniquet above and below it, then cut down upon it and extract it.	0.77554774
If it is deep in the flesh and you cannot find it, use a cautery iron to burn the area until it dies. The main concern is its corruption, which can damage the area as mentioned.	But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm. The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said.	0.7310339
If it reaches the head near the eye, bind the area above the eyebrow tightly, make an incision over it, and extract it. The patient should then cleanse their body with medicines that expel putrid humors and avoid foods that cause putrefaction.	So if you see that it has entered the head and is near the eye, then bind a strong bandage over the forehead beneath it, then cut down upon it and draw it out. It is important also for the patient to take care to cleanse his body with laxative medicines from all corrupt and evil humours. He should also avoid all foods giving rise to putrefaction.	0.797885
