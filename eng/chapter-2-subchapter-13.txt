 CHAPTER THIRTEEN.
On entropion occurring in the upper eyelid.
 The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e.
hareeye).
Now sometimes this inversion is natural, sometimes acquired.
It is acquired either from the cicatrization of an injury, or an incision, or cauterization, or the like.
The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed.
In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.
Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.
The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before.
This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.
