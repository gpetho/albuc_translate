Chapter twenty-four on cauterizing lung disease and cough.	CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR. On cauterization for pulmonary disease and for cough.	0.89565283
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauterizations above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the breasts, and the cautery iron should be nail-shaped in the form that has been previously described.	When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts. Let the cautery be claviform as described above.	0.8443486
And if you wish, let your cauterization be by spotting with the cautery iron that is called "the point," and its form has been previously described in the spotting for earache, and the spots should be from thirty spots to about that number.	And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache. The punctures should number upwards of thirty.	0.8106949
Then treat him with what has been mentioned previously until he recovers.	Then treat as aforesaid until healed.	0.8404671
And a cautery iron with three prongs may be made in this form, and cauterization is hastened with it because you cauterize three cauterizations with it at once.	Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.	0.75602794
