Often a wart grows at the tip of the nose, then enlarges and increases with time until its appearance becomes ugly.	There frequently spring from the end of the nose warts that grow and increase daily till they disfigure the man.	0.6688199
Therefore, it should be cut off at its first appearance and completely excised. Then, either cauterization or a caustic medication that acts as cauterization should be applied to the area. If its excision is delayed until it grows large, examine it.  If it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and has little sensation.	So you should cut them out when they first appear; totally eradicate them and apply to the place cauterization, either actual or by caustic. But if excision of them has been overlooked till they have grown big, then examine, and if the growth is stone-like, hard, and pale in colour, and with little sensation, do not interfere with it with an instrument, for it is a cancerous tumour.	0.78818274
Do not apply iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen that when this tumor is cut, a great affliction returns upon its owner.  If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that complete excision is possible, Then have the patient vomit and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the site with something that dries and constricts until it heals.	For I have often seen people cut these tumours, and great affliction resulted to the sufferer. But if the tumour be soft to the touch, not pale coloured, and you see it can be wholly removed, then purge the patient, and cut it off him fearlessly, and treat the place with astringents and styptics till healed.	0.8005
