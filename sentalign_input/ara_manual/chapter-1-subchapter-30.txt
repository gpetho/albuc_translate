Chapter Thirty.
On Cauterizing the Spleen.
If you have treated a disease of the spleen with the treatments mentioned in the section on partitioning, and your treatment was not successful, cauterization is done in three ways, all of which are correct. One of them is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.
in the shape of the liver cauterizations, the form of which has been presented, with the space between each cauterization being the width of a finger or slightly more. The form of the cautery is the same as that mentioned for cauterizing the liver.  Do not insert your hand deeply with the cautery. The patient's position is lying on their back.
The other approach is at the elbow. You lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends. Your lifting of the skin should be across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert the two skewers, very hot, until they penetrate the skin on the other side. Then you remove the cautery, making four cauterizations. If you wish, you can cauterize with the other cautery, which has three skewers.
Then treat the cauterization site after you leave it to drain pus for many days, as this is more effective than all the preceding treatments.
