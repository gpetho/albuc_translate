of the large throat/windpipe
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and it is a large abscess the color of soot, and is very common in women;
and it is of two kinds:
natural, and accidental;
in the natural one there is no trick/deceit.
And the accidental is of two kinds, one of which resembles a fatty knot, and the other kind resembles an abscess that comes from a knotted artery;
and there is fear, and it is not appropriate to operate with fire except in the one that is small, and test and examine it with a probe:
if you find it like a fatty knot, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it as one cuts knots, and pull it out with its entire covering, if it has any;
and carefully examine everything, and treat it as appropriate, until it is completely healed.
