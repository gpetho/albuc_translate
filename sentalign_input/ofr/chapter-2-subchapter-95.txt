of the common veins of the body
There are 31 veins from which one bleeds, of which 16 are in the head, namely:
Two pulsating veins which are behind the ears, which are called the two "arteries behind the ear";
and the two arteries which are visible in the two temples;
and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "corner veins";
and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead;
and the vein which is at the tip of the nose;
and the two jugular veins that are in the neck;
and the two veins that are in the upper lips of the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; (possibly referring to the superior labial veins)
and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and it is on the left side, and the lay people call it the "head vein";
and the middle one is called "faste," and it is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it the "heart vein";
and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it the "belly vein", and it is above the elbow, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which appears clearly on the wrist.
And the salvatella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins:
one is below the curve of the wrist on the left side, and the second, the saphenous, which is at the ankle on the right side;
and the vein which is called "nesse," which is on the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins below these.
Bleeding the veins that are behind the ears helps with chronic catarrh and migraines;
and the way to bleed them, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth;
then have the patient tighten their neck by screwing their head, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head:
then search for them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed with a lancet;
then take the lancet, and push it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well the width of two fingers, and let out as much blood as you see fit;
then bandage and tie it until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding the two arteries that are in the two temples is beneficial for chronic and sudden migraines, and habitual ophthalmia, and for a burning sensation of sharp tears in the eyes;
and the method of bleeding is as I say:
and it is that the patient strains his neck until the two veins appear clearly;
and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed with a lancet;
then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done with the two other veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then untie the patient, and put your finger over the vein for an hour, then apply cotton;
and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of them and of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for long-standing illnesses of the face, and for migraines, and for redness;
and the procedure is that the patient strains his neck by twisting, until the vein appears;
then take the instrument which is called "digger," of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and strike upon it with your hand, or with something else, and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you desire;
then release the patient's neck, and tie off the vein until it is healed, and sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
However, it is not necessary that the lancet be too sharp;
and cut across it, because the bone is near, and perhaps the lancet breaks when it is thin.
Bleeding the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps the eyes, and against ringworm, and redness, and sty in the eye, and diseases of the face;
and the manner of bleeding them is that the patient strains his neck by twisting with some bandage, as before;
then bleed him, and let the incision be across, a little along the lancet a little wide, for there is no flesh there.
And if the lancet is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let the blood flow as much as you need, and then apply cotton on it, and tie it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for acute illness, and sudden madness, and diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that comes to the face, and especially when it is chronic;
and the way to perform the bleeding is that the patient tightens his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take the thin long lancet, and insert it in the middle of the lip in the space that is between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then tie it up for a night, because it is very quickly restored;
and this is the shape of the lancet:
Bleeding from the two tonsils helps with shortness of breath, and the onset of leprosy, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and corrosive ulcers, and herpes, and malignant ulcers;
and the way to perform the bleeding is that the patient stretches his neck below both, as we have said;
and let the practitioner stand above the patient's head, and let the patient sit on a seat, then bleed the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do the same in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and compress both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke;
and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
of the bleeding of the lips
Bleeding the upper lip veins helps with glue in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and cracked lips, and the nose and around it.
And the way to perform the bleeding is to have the patient sit in front of you, and compress his neck as I have said;
then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognizable because they are black, and because around them are small black veins:
then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, cut the largest one on each side, and do the same for the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
of the bleeding under the tongue
Bleeding the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding the cephalic vein, and this is for tightening of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the proper way to bleed is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts their tongue, and you look underneath on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, because underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the neck that are commonly bled are bled in two ways:
either by pricking with a myrtle-leaf-shaped lancet, broad, or a subtle olive-shaped one like cutting edges, and it is called "anesil";
and they are broad and narrow according to the width and narrowness of the veins.
The myrtle leaf shape is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And it is needed for opening hairy veins full of visible thick blood, and that contain thick and turbid blood;
and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more finely pointed, and it is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin, clear blood.
Bleeding from the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and the bloodletter must bleed wisely, and beware of the artery that is beneath.
And if he cuts the artery, and bleeding occurs, then it must be stopped, as I have said;
and the blade should not be piercing, but cutting like a lancet.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you must compress it, and choose another;
or you look for a branch of it, or you bleed from the vein in the middle of the arm instead:
it is clearly visible;
and make the incision with the lancet blade, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place for the bloodletting, you must first, before tightening the arm, touch the area until you feel the pulse;
then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the lancet blade;
and be careful not to strike the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery:
then wipe it.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery:
hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; 
then bind the arm, and leave it like that, and let the patient not move it;
and let him be careful, and not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the ends will retract; 
and the blood will stop.
And take a rind of green stick, and split it, and take one of the halves and tie it on firmly until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good;
if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and stopping the bleeding is not difficult in most cases because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the arm's ligature.
The median vein bleeding in the middle is helpful as it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and the bloodletter must be cautious of the nerve that is underneath, and if he punctures too deep, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and healing is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve is apparent many times, and if it is not apparent in some men due to its thinness, then you must bleed it with a lancet instrument; 
and avoid the nerve as much as possible.
And if there is a vein between two nerves, then open it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein is helpful, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and one should bleed by puncturing at the site of the olive leaf or the myrtle leaf, because it is the safest of all the veins, for there is neither nerve nor artery beneath it.
However, one should seek the easiest location, and it doesn't matter if one misses the first time, and starts again;
and perhaps the area swells in some people, when one misses the first time, but it doesn't matter.
The amount of bloodletting depends on your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that it is administered only to maintain health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and the bloodletting should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow:
that is to say, cephalic, median cubital, and basilic;
and one should be bled at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of plethora appear;
and one should be bled on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
Bloodletting that is administered for illnesses has no fixed time, but rather when there is need, day or night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years old, nor pregnant women except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Nor should the elderly who are past sixty years old be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, they should cleanse the intestines with a light enema, if they have much retained stool, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed someone who is overly satiated with food, nor who is drunk, until they are recovered, nor the dropsical;
and one should beware of bleeding after colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and frequent sexual intercourse with a woman, and from exertion, from staying awake, and from fasting, and that which weakens all strength, whether by something of the mind or of the body;
then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, through foods and drinks and through medicines, if you have the means;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and be bled from the vein of the chest around the third hour, as we have said;
and on that day, guard yourself from exertion, and from difficulty, and from sexual activity, and from similar things;
and be happy and joyful, and let the bloodletter be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature moderately tight, because when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with the hands, until the veins swell, and they can be felt;
then the bloodletter moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then puts a finger of his left hand on that vein a bit below the place where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail upon being lanced.
For there are veins that flee like cords when being bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one places the lancet upon them, it withdraws the lancet and the vein cannot be opened, and thus it is with these; 
and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bloodletter must be knowledgeable in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good;
if not, then start again a little below that place or quickly above, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, let him be for a day or two, and do not bind the arm:
perhaps hot abscesses will develop there;
do not enter the bath, then resume the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly and you doubt that not enough blood will come out as you wish, then strike in that same opening with the entire blade directly;
and work a little hastily, before the place swells;
for this often happens, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not restart the bleeding, and put on a little oil lees, for it lightens the body of blood, and the lees are better in this place than the oil;
and thus administer the oil lees in every bleeding that you bleed from the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and theriac does the same, and ox dung, when it is put on the place;
thus the blood thins and spreads when it is too thick.
And if there comes a large abscess, which happens often, especially when it is not bled except at the time when the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and put on the place a sponge moistened in slightly warm water and salt, and squeeze it for an hour;
and you must do this after the blood has flowed from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains at the place after a few days, it does not harm it;
and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mountain mint, or similar.
And often an abscess and swelling appear at the opening of the basilic vein:
then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft under the pressure of the hand, this swelling is bad.
Be careful then that you do not apply any of the things that we have mentioned, for perhaps it cuts into the artery;
but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with other remedies, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each finger according to the strength of its vein, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red;
and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned;
and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, a larger wound should be made, and the lancet should be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and he should be bled by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this method of bleeding is safe from excessive bleeding and severing a nerve, and is better than bleeding along the length or width.
And to one whose body fails during bleeding, give bread soaked in pomegranate juice;
if he is feverish, then draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, have him eat before bleeding bread soaked in muscat syrup, or in honey syrup flavored with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a fragrant syrup. 
And if he faints during bleeding, after the loss of much blood, he should drink meat broth, and a fine, fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the section or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of a vein. 
And if he wants to air out his arm and bleed again, he should, when he is weakened by extensive bleeding, bleed little by little, according to the extent of his strength, continuously.
And whoever wishes to air out their arm after the first bleeding, and has a strong constitution, let them bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to be bled from another location, should be bled on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is already heated, and causes fever;
so a large quantity must be drawn, and the opening widened until he falls into a faint;
then, as you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse as he bleeds, so that death does not come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not appropriate, when you wish to untie the arm, and let the blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press firmly on it;
nor if it is bent, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time;
or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood that is congealed at the opening of the vein comes out, and put on it a little salt dissolved in water, and press lightly on it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the swelling has subsided.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, bleed it in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled instead of the vein of the head because it is well-suited.
And the manner of the bloodletting is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the vessels are red;
then it should be moderately tied, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not lengthwise nor widely;
and let the opening be wide, and be bled very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put there more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein of the right hand is good for all diseases of the liver, and this is the method:
bind the hand, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that it can be seen;
and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is necessary, put oil and salt on the vein to heal it quickly, and do so for each branch.
Bleeding it in the left hand is good for diseases of the spleen, and do just as I told you on the right side.
Bleeding the saphenous vein is good for all illnesses that are below the body, such as illnesses of the marrow, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and of the thighs and of old legs, and similar illnesses.
And the way to bleed it is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it appears, and ties above the ankle joint;
and the vein is at the ankle, and many branches go above the foot;
bleed it then in the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is better.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are below, and bleed it across as if cutting; 
and let the lancet be sharp.
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bloodletter misses the first time, repeat the second time a little above, because the area is safe;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot likewise. 
The location of the sciatic vein is at the ankle outside, and its bleeding is beneficial for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood. 
And the way to bleed it is that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle four fingers' width by twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way you can, and across;
and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is greatly renowned among many men.
And if you do not find it, bleed any branch of it that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and let as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and tighten it;
it is now healed.
