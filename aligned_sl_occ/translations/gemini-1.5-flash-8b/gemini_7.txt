O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the final one in the science of medicine, by completing it, by its exposition, and by its declaration, it seems to me that I complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the manual operation, that is, surgery.
Because the manual operation is widespread in our region and our time, completely neglected, to the point that the science of it is in great danger, and its practice is lost; and only a few small descriptions remain in the books of the Ancients, which have been distorted by the hands of others and have fallen into error and hesitation, so that the understanding of it is closed and its strength and art are diminished.
And it seems to me that I will revitalize it [the manual operation] by the arrangement of this treatise, in accordance with the method of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and so that it will be provided with the forms of cautery instruments and other instruments of the craft, as is necessary by adding a declaration and by preparing it.
But the reason why a skilled artisan is not found with his own hands in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that its practitioner must previously be versed in the science of anatomy, which recounts the body's parts, their shapes, their junctions and separations; and be aware of the bones, nerves, and tendons, their number, and their origins; and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places from which they come forth.
And therefore Hippocrates says that with one name is little, but in the work little, and more so in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book, for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy, is not spared from falling into error, by which men will die, just as I have seen many such, for some are trained in this science and throw themselves into it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled doctor lance a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some of the neck's arteries, so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor attempt to remove a stone from a man who had suffered for many years, and the stone was large, and he came to him and removed that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I myself warned him to refrain, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I knew beforehand that he would die.
And I saw another surgeon, who took a stipend from a duke in our land, and came to a dark-complexioned man whose thigh was fractured; and the surgeon, through his ignorance, straightened the fracture, pressing on the wound with pads and splints with excessive force, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he unbound it according to his desires, and then he bound it again, and then he left it for several days and commanded that we unbind the ligament; and it remained like this until the thigh and the leg became abscessed, and it perished.
And I was called to him, and I proceeded to unbind the ligament, and tranquility was achieved, and thus he was relieved of his pain.
But meanwhile, the corruption had already been established in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption continued to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it ulcerated for several days, until the evil of it, with the patient's own body, was greatly magnified.
The reason for this is that the cancerous ulcer is pure melancholy humor, so it should not be addressed with iron in its entirety, but rather the limb should be afflicted by being wholly removed.
Therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical operation be divided into two phases: one is the operation associated with health, and the other is the work that carries significant risk in the most vulnerable conditions.
And I have already shown this throughout this book, where operations carry error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to avoid this and abandon it, lest the leaves (or chapters) find a way to speak and bring dishonor upon you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and God's protection, and your patients with skill and firmness.
And use the best approach, by God's grace, to achieve health and commendable success, and abandon the dreadful illnesses with difficult cures, and remove from your tools whatever makes you fearful, so that your zeal and your name are not lost. For greater glory awaits you, and even higher in the world and beyond your holiness.
Gualia has already said in some of his teachings: Do not treat a serious illness, lest you be called bad doctors".
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and first of the first part. The first chapter, ordered from head to foot, discusses the types of instruments and the tools for cauteries, and everything necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and piercing, cupping, poultices, and the extraction of arrows and similar objects,  is fully described and ordered by the types of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting and similar injuries; ordered from head to foot, and detailing the types of instruments.
It is necessary for me to describe the benefits of this cautery and its harms, and in which constitution cauterization is forbidden.
Therefore, I say that the discussion of the benefits and harms of cautery is a long, detailed, and subtly scientific discourse, a secret hidden from view; many wise men have spoken of it, and they have disagreed, but a small part of their discussions will suffice for me, fearing to prolong the writing.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all constitutions universally, whether with or without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial for it, and others say the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for an illness which is caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is unsuitable for a hot and dry illness to be cured with something that is also hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite claim that cautery provides benefit in all hot and dry illnesses affecting the human body, for when you compare the body and its humors to the nature of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say, concerning that matter, that my own experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, this should not be adopted by anyone who has not already been thoroughly practiced and trained in the chapter of cautery through prior exercises, and has grasped the diversity of human constitutions, the nature of illnesses and their various characteristics, their causes, their symptoms, and the timeframe involved.
But in other constitutions, there is no need for such hesitation, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, for all physicians have agreed upon this, and there is no disagreement about the benefits of cautery in those cases.
And know, my children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its efficacy, lies in contrast to cautery with medicinal agents.  The action of fire is direct, affecting only the part that is cauterized, and does not harm other, nearby, parts except to a minimal degree.
However, the action of a burning medicine extends to adjacent parts, and very easily causes a difficult-to-heal illness in a nearby limb, and often results in hearing loss.
But fire, by its intensity and beneficial nature, does not do this unnecessarily. This is known to us through experiment and prolonged study of the art, concerning the truth of causes.  Therefore, I excuse myself from further lengthy discourse.  If it were not that this topic, concerning the secret of fire's use, is not included in my written text, and if the method of its operation in the body, and the expulsion of illnesses through it, were not already discussed in a detailed philosophical demonstration, which could enlighten your understanding.
And know, children, that they disagree about the best time for cautery, and they suggest the springtime as the most suitable time.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at any time, because the potential harm from a delay is outweighed by the benefit of the cautery itself, and especially if the cautery is needed for intense and sudden pain, pains which cannot tolerate delay, as the potential for greater harm from the disease is feared more than the slight harm of a delay.
And this is not for your understanding, children, or it is not considered by sensible doctors; this is, that for an illness cured by cautery, there is no single best time, and they suggest that conclusion.
And the reason is not as they think about it; for cautery is not just any treatment, but a method that alters the temperament and dries the moistures that cause the pain.
But nevertheless, cautery is superior to other treatments because of its power, efficacy, and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that their illness will return at some time, depending on the patient's temperament, the location of the illness, and the strength of the illness itself, and the accumulation of superfluities within them, and what they have consumed in food and similar things; however, if the illness for which cautery is administered is a minor illness in a limb with few superfluities and moistures, like toothache and similar ailments, then it is possible that the pain will not return, but this is done gradually.
And it is a common saying that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and it is a true statement, not in the way they understand it, for they believe there is no cure that is as effective as cautery.
And the reason is the opposite of that; and the understanding that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only true when we have tried various treatment methods for certain illnesses, and those treatments did not work, and then, at the end of the effort, cautery is used, and it proves effective for that specific case. Therefore, the statement that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not true according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except due to the purity and superior substance of gold.
And they said that the location of the cautery doesn't cause harm, although this is not entirely true, for I have tested it and found that this only happens in some bodies and not others.  Cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, just as they said; however, when you perform cautery with gold-fueled fire, it's not clear to you how much gold to use due to the gold's tendency to absorb cold.  If you add too much gold over the heated area, the gold will melt in the fire, causing the artisan to lose control of the process.
Therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more directly towards the correct procedure.
And I have organized this chapter on cautery according to sections, and I have arranged them from head to feet, so that the inquirer may find what they want.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is beneficial for dampness and cold affecting the brain, the causes of which are twofold: one is the cause of a large flow of rheumatic fluid, called "corissa," flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep disorders, toothache, and sore throat.  Generally, all illnesses caused by cold, such as paralysis, stroke, and similar afflictions.
The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, you must order the patient to be purged with laxative medicines, cleansing the head, for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and constitution.
Then you instruct him to shave his head, and have him lie on a smooth bench, placing his hands on his feet.
And then, place the blade of your palm (or, the blade of the cautery tool)  near the bridge of his nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark that place with a probe, and then ignite the olive cautery, of which the method is this:
And then place that [cautery] upon the spot marked with the probe, so that it descends gradually, your hand being tightened little by little, and you turn it.
And then lift your hand slightly and examine the spot.  If you see a significant amount of bone exposed, roughly the size of a grain of millet, then lift your hand; and if not, return your hand with that iron, with another of those [irons], until the bone is visible as I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it over the area, and leave it for three days.
And then place a cloth soaked in vinegar on it and leave it until the scab from the fire is destroyed. And then treat the area with a four-herb ointment until it is healed.
And if the wound remains open, the arm should be raised, because this is better and more helpful.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's tissue has adhered.
And then remove what is adhering to the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery, one should penetrate the back, to strongly press on the bone until the bone breaks, and this is the method of small amputation: And they believe that vapors from the head escape from that location.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery in all cases, only in some individuals, according to a method of fear; and in my opinion, it is better with healing, when it is; for the head is weakened by the interruption of its continuity, as we have testified in other limbs, and especially when the patient's head is of a frail nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and by that use and method, healing occurs.
Second Chapter.
Of the cautery of the head.
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs throughout the head in a prolonged illness, and treatments using leeches, cupping, head purges, plasters, poultices, cauteries, goose-fat, and similar remedies have been employed, and especially if the head has already been cauterized with a cautery which has proven ineffective for the patient, then consider that if the patient's head is of strong constitution, and not frail, and endures considerable coldness, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below the initial one. And then cauterize that area on the corner of their head with a cautery until the affected area is broken open. Incise the affected area, and expose the bone to the extent that we have described, and cauterize that area on the back of the head, in the location called the 'vas' (or vein) — which is the spot where a cupping device is placed. And ease your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience very great pain, different from the pain caused by other cauteries on the head.
And I would place this cautery in its proper location, because the cautery used to cauterize the temples and the back of the head should be a finer instrument than the one used to cauterize the middle of the head; and this is the procedure.
Chapter three.
On the cauterization of non-chronic migraines.
When there is persistent pain in the head, or spreading pain to the eye, the head should be treated with purifying medicines, and the other treatments mentioned in the descriptions of illnesses should be administered. If none of this works, cauterization in that area can be done in two ways: either by cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
However, cauterization with a burning medicine involves taking a piece of garlic, squeezing it, and cutting off the tips of both ends. Then, with a sharp lancet, cut the painful area on the temple until a small cavity is made under the skin, and it is hidden.
Then, apply a compress to the area to firmly constrict it, and leave it for three hours.  After that, remove it, and discard the garlic.  Leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a piece of cloth soaked in wine until the area heals.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron, according to this method:  with fire as a cauterizing agent, of which this is the form:
and it is called "claus clavilhs," because the head of it is shaped like a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
And then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand — so that the surrounding flesh is not burned — and rotate the small iron slowly and swiftly.
And if the amount that is burned by the force of the cauterization is as much as half of it, then lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burned, lest there be a flow of blood.
And then soak a cotton pad in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; and then place a cotton pad soaked in broth, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the sharp edge of the knife-like cautery, and beware of cutting an artery in this particular, not-ancient, procedure.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the cauterization of an old migraine.
When you treat a migraine with what we have said about the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not work, and sometimes because the illness does not respond to what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire cauterization, then you should heat the knife-cautery until it is white hot, then apply it to the area of pain in a line the length of half a finger, or that much; and hold your hand steady once, and push until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to avoid damaging the continuity of the jawbone, which is strained by chewing, and to ensure that the ligaments and nerves that move it are not injured, and that a spasm does not develop.
And if it is about the care and caution of the flow of blood from the cut artery, because there is fear in cutting it, and especially for someone who is ignorant of what they are doing and is not skilled and experienced; and leaves the operation unfinished at the beginning.
And I will come back to the treatment of accidental blood flow from an artery in its own manner, in its own section of this book.
And if you see that this illness is not helped by this cauterization and you see the patient's condition as tolerable, cauterize that middle part of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on cutting arteries with a cautery having two blades, and this is a better and more beneficial cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of cauterization of ear aches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments as described in the previous section, and the pain does not subside, then apply the cautery, and this is the one called a *puncta*, and this is its shape:
And then apply the cautery to the affected area, and let it be moved around the entire ear in a circular motion, or in a circuit over each affected spot if the pain is in several places. Move the cautery along the ear from the base slowly, after you have marked the area with a probe.
And if the cautery is applied with ten points to the entire ear, then cauterize those spots, and then treat the areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Of cauterization of tumors.
Tumors which are cured by cauterization are only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of tumor with poultices, emetics, and remedies, and your treatment does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, a second a little below their temple, and the third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the affected area, for softening occurs only in the area that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery at the right end of the ear, slightly above the corner of the head, and another at the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the finger, and you hold the cautery until the quantity of half of the affected area is burned.
And this is the method of cauterization, and it is a type of surgical procedure, the method of which is described below. However, it is more subtle than what you have seen; and it is necessary to cut away some of the superfluous flesh.
And then treat the area with whatever was previously used until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On cauterization for old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old, and you have treated it with what we have described, but your treatment isn't working and the patient has no fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with one cautery on the middle of the head, as we said before; and with a cautery on the temple. And the method of cauterization is done according to what has been previously stated.
And it has already been cauterized on the opening of the stomach; and further back; and then it should be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the cauterization of forgetfulness caused by flame.
It is necessary to give the patient at the beginning large jars and pills, clarifying the brain.
And then wash the entire head of the patient and place on their forehead a plaster of the kind described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply it several times, for this is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already stated.
And so, if this treatment is effective, good; but if not, then apply three cauteries to the back part of his head, descending from the highest part of the head down to the lowest part of the neck. And place the width of the finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with what has been previously described.
But if the application and the patient tolerate it, then apply a cautery in the middle area; and if you wish a greater application, then cauterize it at both horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, following the previously given form.
Chapter 9.
Of cauterization for paralysis and softening of the whole body.
You must proceed with cleansing the head with herbs and as we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on all the horns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if in the illness of softening of the body, the patient is enduring it and the illness is severe, then cauterize the patient with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continuously with a cautery until the bone is loosened somewhat, and lift your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive cautery.
Chapter 10.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the brain from the beginning with herbs and the other treatment we have mentioned in the division when the patient is severe and tolerates the application of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate the medicines, then administer poultices and masticatories that cleanse the brain, doing so for many days, with a beneficial diet.
And then, bind the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of the head, and cauterize on each temple. And if the patient is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize with the cauteries mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the spinal vertebrae of the neck and back.
Let the cautery be olive-like, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries which we have mentioned in the previous discussion of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess tending toward melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain, according to what has been previously stated in the division.
And then shave the patient's head, and then apply a properly made cautery to the scalp, and then place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and held steady on all sides.
And then apply a liniment; and the best is an old sheep's wool. And warm that over the fire with moderate heat, as much as the patient can tolerate when it is applied. And then place that in the middle of the patient's head on the scalp, and leave it until it is cooled.
And do this to the patient once a week, with the other treatments, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that place with small punctures according to the patient's tolerance, but keep your hand with a cautery so it is adequately heated: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that cloth soaked in wool or hen's dung.
Chapter 12.
Of cauterization of descending water in the eye.
When you have observed the beginning of water in the eye, according to the signs I have mentioned in the previous section, then begin giving the patient drinks that will strengthen his head and guard it from all moisture.
And have him sweat in a bath for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize with two cauteries above the two temples if the beginning of the water's infection is in both eyes, or with one on one side if the water's infection is in one eye.
Cut with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are below the crown; and let the cauteries be in that line, at the width of the temples.
And beware of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flowing from him, stop it with some medicine, as is possible for you.
And I will come with knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below two bones with two cauteries directly applied.
Chapter 13.
Of the cauterization of old sores.
When sores on the eyelids are old, and persistently through the veins and arteries, which are in the visible area of the head's exterior, and it is verified that this is superfluous cold phlegm, then cauterize it with the cautery that we have recounted in the chapter about initially applying hot water to sores, and with a cautery in the middle part of the head, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize that along the entire eyelid edge on the eyebrow's end with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Of the cauterization of nasal foul odor.
When you treat it with what we have described in the division, and your treatment is not effective, then prepare and give the patient potions to drink for three nights; and afterwards, shave the patient's head and cauterize with a smaller cautery and an olive-oil cautery. Then cauterize the area with a clove-shaped cautery, using two cauteries on the two eyebrows below the hair, a small one each.
And be careful of the arc, so you don't set it on fire.
And this is the form of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cauterization for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize that area above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every part, and let them be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand with the cautery too hard, but according to the amount that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
Chapter 16.
Of cautery of the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward and pierce the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they pierce the eye, cauterization in those cases is in two ways: either with burning or with a burning medicine.
If with a cautery using fire, command the patient beforehand to remove their own hairs in the same way that barbers do, until they are drawn out and plucked; and if you pierce the skin near their roots, then you must cover the eyes with a bandage so they are not irritated until the hairs are grown back.
Then, when they have grown back and are plucked, place the patient's head in your lap, and then gently press on the eyelid of their eyes with a probe, using a marking that resembles the shape of a myrtle leaf, and have the beginning of the marking near the hairs.
And then apply cotton soaked in egg white or a ptillium mucilage to the eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this form.
And then cauterize along the marked area, little by little, in many applications, until the surface of the skin, which is similar to a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
The sign of successful treatment is that you see the eyelid contracted and the hairs raised toward the puncture in the eye.
And then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then apply cotton with a bandage until the scab is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
However, if any cause returns to the hair follicles and the eyelid softens, then do the cautery again in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are beneath the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position, healed, and the hairs no longer prick the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine is what you instruct the patient to do to the hairs until they are elongated and healed, and then a leaf-shaped piece of cloth is made resembling a myrtle leaf.
And then take known medicinal herbs and fresh uncooked lard (or something like that), and thoroughly mix these ingredients quickly so they don't get cold.  Then spread this mixture on the leaf-shaped cloth, and place it over the affected eye(s). Place a cloth soaked in egg white under the eye.  And the patient's head should be supported by you.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it gently, and do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for the burning should be like that of fire.
And thus, when the patient feels the burning sensation, remove the medicine and gently wipe it away with your finger; then, when the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.  Then see if the eyelid has been raised, just as if it were cured by cauterization with fire or incision; if so, it is good. If not, put more medicine on the area where the previous medicine did not reach, and do not stop until the wound is healed, and the eye is closed.
Then apply a bandage over it until the burn is healed, and then treat it with a final ointment or other remedy until it is completely cured.
You must, during your treatment, diligently ensure that no medicine gets into the eye.  If, after a few days, the eyelid becomes softened and something from the lashes enters the eye, then repeat your application of medicine to the softened part of the eyelid, just as you did at the beginning, and continue until it is healed.
And this is the method for treating eye injuries.
And know that human eye injuries vary in size and severity, and therefore your treatment is tailored accordingly.
And the path to healing in this art should not be hidden from the student.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of fistulas in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula, as described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have an assistant hold the patient's head between your hands, so that it is neither moved nor shaken by the patient's head movements.
And then place a piece of linen soaked in egg white or gum arabic over the patient's eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this shape:
which is concave, like the shape of a reed or a hawk's wing, on the one end where the cautery is made.
And if you wish, it should penetrate into the other end. And if you wish, it should be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus and dry it out. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which is well ignited, over it. Hold your hand a short distance from the cautery over the area of the nose, so that neither your hand nor the patient is disturbed. Then place the cautery on the ulcer and cauterize it.
And so, if at the beginning your cautery reaches the bone, it is good.  But if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary.  Leave it like that for three days, and then apply a compress with wool and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if several days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is smooth according to what is suitable in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier doctors said:  Apply to the area of the fistula and make a hole there. Then, place in that fissure a fine, thin piece of material, such as: and pour into it a quantity of molten lead. Hold your hand firmly on the instrument and prevent the patient from moving, so that the molten lead does not flow onto the wound.  It is necessary to place a compress soaked in egg white or water over the patient's wound.  For molten lead adheres to the fistula area and heals it through a remarkable cure.
And if the fistula is healed by what we have said about the cautery and treatment, it is good.  But if not, then it is necessary to administer a trepanation of the nose and reduce the fistula to the nasal cavity, according to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of the cauterization of the fissure of the pot.
Often fissures occur in the lips, and more often in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment is not effective, then heat the small knife-cautery according to this form that is described:
And its cavity should be according to the thinness of the blade.
Then carefully apply that heated [cautery] to those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or in the palate or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops, then breaks open, and then becomes chronic, and pus forms and a fistula is created, and then you treat it and the treatment is ineffective, then you must use a heated cautery, according to the size that is found in the fistula, and you must place that heated thing in the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and behind it they do this one or two times; and then treat it with what we have said about healing until it is healed.
And so, if the pus is cut off and healed, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what will be found in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with medicine but it doesn't help, then place the patient's head on your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be something like this, so that you place the nozzle over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold your hand there briefly so that the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization a few times as you wish.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, for the decayed tooth is sealed, the softened gum is strengthened, and the corrupt moisture is dried out.
Chapter 21.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is caused by cold, or there is cold or a worm there, and you do not consider medical treatment appropriate, then the cauterization in that case is done in two ways: either cauterization with cow dung, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with dung is done by taking cow dung, boiling it in an iron container, then taking a piece of cloth and wrapping it around the end of a probe, immersing it in the boiled dung, and quickly applying it to the aching tooth until it cools down.
And then repeat this a few times until the effect of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cloth in the aforementioned dung, place that on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the iron reaches the opening of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by holding a heated iron or bronze rod, ensuring that it is thick enough so that the heat doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery iron to the desired temperature, place it on the tooth and hold it there until it cools; do this several times until the pain is gone either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, with the application of this cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and keep it in for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize any extremity as is possible for you.
And this is the method of using the cannula:
Chapter 22.
On the cauterization of extrophules.
When extrophules are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and are not responsive to digestion by medicine, and you wish to achieve digestion of them easily, then you heat the cautery, shaped as follows: having two open ends so that smoke escapes from the cautery from one end, and place this heated cautery over the abscess once, and another time if needed, until the heat reaches the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it on for three days, and place on it a compress soaked in vinegar until that which the fire has burned is removed.
And then treat it with ointment, bandages, and dressings until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Of cauterization of a sore throat and constriction of the windpipe.
When humidity descends upon the bronchial tubes, and especially when it is accompanied by a coldness of constitution, then the patient must first be evacuated with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the affected area near the root of the throat in the depressed location.
And be careful not to cauterize too close to the throat or burn the skin too deeply, but only a little.
And cauterize it with another cautery near the junction of the neck in the back of the spine. And its cautery should be a sharp, pointed cautery, in the manner previously described.
And then treat it with what was previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung illnesses are caused by cold moisture and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is longstanding, then cauterize the area with two cauteries above the breastbone in the depressed, distant, and sunken places; and with another cautery in the middle part of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be sharp-pointed according to the previous method.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be performed with a pointed cautery, the form of which is described in the treatment of earache.
And let there be punctures at those points; and then treat that with the same [method] as previously described until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with it: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the support.
When the head of the support (presumably a ligament or tendon) is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and does not stay fixed in the moment of its return from dislocation until it's in place, and then, through a slight movement, it's dislocated again as it should, as we have testified, then it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation, and then turn the patient on their back or on their side; and then elevate the tendon (or whatever part of the support) that is on the inside of the titillic to the parts above with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
And then heat the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates through to the other side; and the figure of cauterization will then be that of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place on the cauterized area some boiled, salted poultices, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a wedge-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, for the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive humidity enters the stomach, causing it to stray from its natural constitution and multiply within, and if you continue with the treatment methods and do not improve it, then the patient should be placed on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize the area using three cauteries: one under the foot, approximately the size of a finger, with a wedge-shaped cautery, and two more below the sides of the cauterized area, until a triangular cauterization pattern is achieved; and extend the points between the cauteries that do not touch to make a pressure.
And if the depth of the cautery is the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of a cord.
And the shape of the cautery should be in this form without additions. And if you want, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form; and this should be a cautery in the form of a circle, in this form:
And cauterize the stomach by puncturing it where the cautery has frightened it:  that is, you must prick the stomach in the desired quantity with a probe, and then cauterize the punctures with a cautery; then heal it with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the cauterization of a cold liver.
When the liver experiences pain due to coldness, moisture, or excessive windiness, until its normal condition is restored through the expulsion of excess, and the patient has been treated with what we have described and yet is not improved, then the patient should be laid on their back, and three cauteries should be applied with a probe in this form and the same size over the liver beneath the hypochondria, where the human decubitus lies.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be the length of the right side of the body.
And do not burn the patient with the cautery too much.
And if the amount of what is hardened is equal to half the size of a fingernail, and no more is applied; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if not standing, then lying down, with their legs spread, and they raise their arms.
And you are able to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to overdo the cauterization, and don't heat the area the size of a fingernail so much that it affects the whole body and reaches the intestines, for the nail is delicate here; and understand this.
Chapter 28.
On the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When a swelling or abscess is suspected in the liver, and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, then if it's in the liver tissue, the patient experiences a heavy and sharp pain.
And if it's in the liver's covering, the pain is sharp and often exhausts the physicians in their attempts to treat it.
Therefore, the patient should be placed on their side; then, locate the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rod, the form of which is shown on the preceding page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the underlying tissue, until it bleeds clean.
And then treat it as you would other abscesses until it is healed.
And this type of cautery should only be used by those whose study of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many ailments have been successfully treated; but even with experience, sometimes this method is too daring for this procedure.  Rather, let us leave it alone, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
Of cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterizing the roots of the plant *aristologia* for pleurisy, according to this method, is effective.  Take a long, dry root of *aristologia*, which is found, and should be about the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire.  Next, cauterize with a cautery at the point between the furcula (collarbone) and the neck.  Use two smaller cauteries guiding downwards, slightly angled towards the area below the beard.  Use two more cauteries on the area sloping between the fifth rib and the sixth, tilted slightly towards the back.  Use another cautery in the middle of the chest/breastbone area, another on the stomach, and three more on the back area. Use a cautery on the space between the two shoulders.  And lastly, use two more cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery between the shoulders.
And you should not grip the cautery with your hand, but rather hold it in a way that is visible/evident in the procedure.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron, shaped like a ray, and ignite it.  Then they place it on the area between the ribs until it reaches the abscess and draws out the pus, just as we have described for liver abscesses.
However, this cauterization is not without risk, for it can quickly cause an accidental fistula in the area that cannot be healed.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease with the methods we've described for its division and don't see improvement, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct.  One way is to make three or four lines of cauterization along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the cauteries for the liver, as illustrated previously.
And the distance between each cautery should be the width of a finger, or slightly more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be supported on their back.
And another way of cauterizing is to ignite the cautery using two jets of flame, as described in the chapter on muscle dislocations, and raise the cord which is in the spleen area, where the patient's left side lies.
And the elevation you make, raising the cord along the length of the body, should be such that the cauteries are made along the width of the body.
And then introduce the two jets of flame, very hot, into that area so that with those jets you penetrate the cord on the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three jets of flame.
And then you treat the cautery, since it has stopped emitting flame after too many days, for this is more important than the other preceding actions in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
On the cauterization of dropsy patients.
Cautery is not applied to dropsy patients, but to those with ulcers (or possibly "swelling", depending on the specific meaning of *alcinte3*)  properly.
When you treat a dropsy patient with the methods of treatment we have described in the section and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries in the area around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the severity of the condition.
And then leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not relieve the patient of the treatment near the cautery with what is necessary, for this would combine two intentions, and hasten the healing process with detrimental assistance.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be wedge-shaped, similar to the previously described shape.  The shape of the cautery used for the back should be olive-shaped, similar to the preceding shape.
Chapter 32.
Of cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are affected by dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular bones.  Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand again, and do not fully lower it, for the yellow water will seep back.
The cautery should be of this shape:  Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh use the knife-like end of the cautery. And the cautery should follow the length of the thigh: one below the knee and another below the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with those remedies we have described.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the abdominal region.
When the abdominal region is affected by cold and moisture, weakening the digestive and retentive powers, which reside in the stomach and intestines, it is treated with the methods of treatment we've described.  If the patient endures cauterization, exhibiting the effect of a strong remedy, then cauterize the area with a large cautery on their stomach, as previously described for stomach cauterization, using a circular cautery and four cauteries in a circle around the navel, using a fine needle-like cautery.  And use a large, broad cautery on the surrounding region, or two cauteries.
And if the excess moisture is excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the area around the groin and intestines, with a strong and precise placement of two cauteries on the stomach and near the groin, for this is a perfect cure and a worthwhile remedy, from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are caused by thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and are not cured by the methods we previously described, then cauterize with three cauteries above the piles below the small of the back and a small triangular one, and a cautery above the navel, held for two beats.
And if you fear that the patient's stomach is chilled, and the food is not digested, and the patient's face is often inflamed, then cauterize the area above the stomach with a large cautery as described before; and with a cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on the spleen using a pointed cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of boils, before their excision.
When you excise a boil, then you ignite the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then place that ignited cautery into the excised boil, and hold your hand there until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice, for if the boils are numerous, then cauterize each one of them as we have described, and then treat them with the ointments you prescribe to them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on a large area, it is more harmful than helpful.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the affected parts of the body.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, it should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when someone has a natural fistula, and it is old, with festering pus and corrupt moisture, then what is most appropriate is to probe it gently, and then determine the depth using the aforementioned probe.
Then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a ray. And then place that heated cautery into the fistula, to a depth corresponding to how deep the probe went.
And repeat the cauterization until those corrupted tissues are burned, once, twice, or thrice, depending on what is necessary.
And be careful not to burn any nerves or veins; or if the fistula extends to the bladder or the bowel, then avoid those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you think it is not penetrating deeply.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter is removed from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed from there, then know that it is penetrating deeply or that the area is corrupted, or that this comes from one of those causes from which it will return to its original state.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the kidneys.
When pain in the kidneys arises from cold or excessive wind, and therefore the patient's side is inflamed, then it is necessary to cauterize the area around each kidney with a pointed cautery, from which the pain will subside.
And cauterize slightly lower with the second, so that three aligned cauteries will be made, and thus they will be more effective in helping.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When the bladder suffers weakness and softening due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize the area just below the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and another on the left side of the patient.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the amount of pain; and cauterize that area with one cautery at the lowest part of the groin, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a pointed one, as is the procedure.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the mother.
When cold and moisture affect the mother, and therefore pregnancy is forbidden, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and their discharge is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the area below the groin, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of dislocation of the ankle.
When mucous moisture is poured into the ankle joint area, causing it to leave its proper place, and a sign of this is that one leg is lengthened in comparison to the other when they are placed together. And the location of the dislocation is found in the area where it bulges.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient's ankle area with a circular cautery, after you have marked the area with a probe in the shape of the wound, so that the area falls into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the same form used in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, then cauterize the area with three larger olive-shaped cauteries.
And let the cauterization be done according to the extent of the inflammation throughout the entire area; and afterwards, treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes to the area of the buttock, and it is caused by cold and dampness, if the ailment is cured by what we have previously mentioned and nothing else works, and this is old information, then you should purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial/similar pills; and then cauterize the area.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods.  One is to cauterize the area on the patient's buttock with three triangular cauteries in this shape; and make a good depth with them. And the spaces between each cautery should be the width of a finger, if the cautery is olive-sized or larger.
But sometimes the cautery is placed in the middle of the area on top of the buttock, so there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, the form of which is used in the cauterization of a dislocated hip.  Make a continuous circle and burn the surface of the entire joint.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the buttock and does not extend into the thigh.
However, if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, over the area where the patient's pain is; and with one cautery on the knee cap, about four finger-widths away from the outside.
And if the cautery is a knife, the depth of the cautery should be in proportion to the size of the joint's surface area.
And if the patient reports that the pain extends to the area near the toes, then cauterize there with a cautery using three, four, or more points, as needed.
And if the patient indicates pain below the knee, near the thigh, then cauterize that area with a sharp knife cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not burn the nerves or large arteries, and that this does not cause the patient further harm or contraction.
And I have seen others who cauterized near the ankle, and in the cauterization, the leg swelled until the tumor reached the foot, and the foot became perforated and corrupted. And soon after, severe abdominal distension occurred, and this resulted in death.
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each one in this manner.
And some learned ones say in the cauterization of an ulcer, this is the manner: make a circle of iron, whose circumference is half a palm; and let it be near its orifice, according to the thickness of a date pit or a little less.
And within that circle be another third; and let the space between them be the quantity of a nut's shell; and let those circles be open in two parts; and let the length of those cuts be one nut or two nuts, and make in those iron margins decently fitted into the circles; and this is its form:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the ulcer, the sick person lying on their side. And therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at one time.
And then leave that for three days; then plaster it with butter and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: "Oh, sons, of this kind of cautery we have used little because of the fear of its effect, and because few have been found who look favourably upon it.
However, of good cauteries, those who endure them, and find the spot with it.
But cauterization with adhering medicines is that you make two circles, having a perforated tool with which to put the handle of the iron door; let the length of the wall be in the proportion of two nuts or keys, those.
And if the spaces between each are the amount of the finger's thickness; and be open below and above, and be such that they contain each other according to this form:
And then place the sick person on their right side, and place your hand on the area of the hip; and then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and let the heat be gradually increased using a small fire, and keep it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and scorching sensation – for that brings about a burning sensation as if from fire – until the burning stops.
And then raise your hand with the instrument and remove the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water.
And then leave that for three days and place a bandage over it until the black mark of the burn has faded, and leave it for a few more days, and the scab will come off; this is the final treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the thigh or leg, do the same treatment as for the hip, using a poultice containing water.
And this is the method of hot water treatment, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take a part of alkali and an equal part of unburnt ashes, pulverize them, and place them in a new pot whose bottom is perforated with a small hole, according to the amount needed to enter the affected area.
And place another unglazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot, and pour soft water over the alkali and ashes in the first pot,  a little at a time, until you compress them well with your hand.  Let the excess water drain through the hole in the bottom pot.
Then, pour off all that water and add more fresh ashes and alkali, because this mixture is a very strong astringent, used in many medical operations and cauterizations of other parts of the body,  because its action is like fire.
And some of the medicines used for cauterization include, for example, honey mixed with vinegar and ashes.
And Galen recounted the story of an ancient man's treatment and cure for pain in the groin and sciatic nerve, praising the effectiveness greatly, saying he required no further treatment, and because he was cured in a single instance as recounted, the remedy is said to be very effective and quite certain for that condition.
And it is to be taken from fresh green plants, and if no green is found, then fresh figs should be used; and it should be crushed with a little of this and placed upon the groin where the pain is, or on the thigh, or leg, and bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient experiences relief from the burning.
And then put that person in a bath, and when their body is warmed, place them on the ground, for the pain will cease and they will be healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the body's evacuation.
However, Aesculapius says that when a goat's vein is cauterized with a fissure, it benefits the person greatly; and the cautery should be done in this way: wool should be soaked in old olive oil, and placed between the heel and the ankle.
Then take dry goat's flesh, and burn it in a fire until it forms charcoal; and then place it on the wool, and let it remain there until it is spread out. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the sensation of the bite reaches the heart and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the cautery of goats (or perhaps "cautery of the veins," referring to the goat's vein).
Chapter 42.
Of cauterization for pain of two (kinds/sources).
Sometimes pain in the back arises from various causes, such as blows or impacts or excessive drainage, and for similar causes, through the infusion of cold and moist material.
And cautery is only effective in this particular type of pain, which is caused by the effusion of cold material.
Therefore, it is necessary to drain the patient with pills and similar remedies, which should be placed on the back where the pain is located, three lines according to its width.  Then, in each line, use 5 or more cauteries, according to the patient's tolerance and the effectiveness of the treatment.
And let the cauterization be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a medial, wedge-shaped cautery, following this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a swelling.
Often this illness afflicts young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it causes difficulty in their gait, posture, and movement.
And you find that the lowermost vertebra of the back and the vertebrae below it are beginning to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery that is circular in shape. that takes the cautery over the entire area of the vertebra completely.
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery for two or three lines. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful not to apply cautery to swelling caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter 44.
Of the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which spread throughout each limb of the body, and when pain comes to the feet, it is customary for doctors to properly call this gout.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold is treated with medicinal methods and the pain does not subside, then cauterize it.
And you cauterize the area around the foot joint with many cauteries to promote drainage.
And the cautery should be olive-oil based, whose form is as follows:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pain spreads to the knees or other joints, which often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides using this olive-oil-based cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize the area, but do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand; only slightly warm the skin around the affected area.
And if the pain ascends to the knee and thigh, then administer the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and it is called "suagra" (likely a specific type of pain), then puncture the hollows (or veins) along the line of the blood vessels, making punctures along those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture the hollows (or veins) along the line of the blood vessels on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pain spreads over a few days to the thighs or muscles, then cauterize those areas from all sides with the tools (or implements).
And do not abandon the patient to a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the "flacma" (possibly a type of harmful substance or humor) is evacuated with this cautery, the patient will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On cauterization of ruptures (or injuries).
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines are protruding from the hernia at the groin area, and this is just beginning, then you should instruct the patient to abstain from eating on that day and use soothing things so that the rupture recedes from the abdomen.
And then, you should support the patient between your hands on their back, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines are fully out.
And then, return it with your fingers and gently grasp the rupture on the pelvic bone, marking the extremity of which resembles half a circle, in the parts above the body.
And then, apply the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is very red and emits sparks. And then, return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out again.
And you have already opened between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, and another servant is on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then, place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery steady, and continue until you have penetrated the bone of the shin to the middle of the thigh; and repeat with it again if you have not reached the bone on the first attempt.
And carefully observe the movement of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest the patient suffer death or other serious harm.
And know that if, with the cautery, you do not reach the bone, your operation is not complete.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle, according to their size and measure.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the scab from the fire is gone.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and the wound are sealed.
And it is necessary to regulate the patient's nourishment according to the length of their treatment, which will support their stomach and prevent the intestine from coming out due to the effort of healing.
And then, when approximately 40 days have passed, administer a properly made bandage, and let them wear that for another 40 days.
And abstain from work, overeating, and strong drink, for if they follow this regimen of complete healing, they will be cured.
And I will now describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and if, at the beginning, you want to prevent them from emerging, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery, according to its size, and let it dry out as much as one third of it; then treat it with what we have already described, and do not continue further.
And some early practitioners would say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, following this shape, once it has been marked with a probe:
And a line is drawn along the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and you use a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first, lighter cautery is better.
Chapter 46.
Of the cauterization of torsion.
When pain arises in some limbs due to injury or impact, and that pain persists for a long time and you find no cure with medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be appropriate to the size and smallness of the limb, its strength and weakness, the location of the torsion, and the pain it causes.
So if it is healed by the first cautery, well and good; but if not, then repeat the cautery; for it is customary with such pains that they are located in a limb adjacent to the one that is affected, so you must treat them with cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some cases of leprosy are greatly helped by cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider if the leprosy is recent and curable with what we have said in the division, and if not, and if you fear that the corruption has spread throughout the body and affected the whole constitution, then cauterize that part of the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second below that, along the hairline; one on each temple; and one at the back of the neck or nape of the neck.
Finally, hold the cautery on the skin until it creates a small indentation in the bone, so that the release of thick vapors is relieved from that area, and cauterize over the spleen as necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread significantly and is clearly visible, then you should cauterize with the cauteries mentioned for the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on each cheekbone, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the hips, one on the hips, and two on the ribs, one on each rib, and two on the elbows, and one on each elbow, and two on the thighs, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of each foot; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the hollows of the hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are over the heel so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes, it is cauterized with one cautery on the hip bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do from wounds, because the body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be large or small, according to the limbs and joints, in accordance with the described types of instruments.
And then treat the cauterized area with flour of barley cooked with honey and with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery enter the skin slightly. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes, numbness affecting the hands and feet, and the spinal column, as well as the nerves that supply that limb, is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
However, do not presume upon this unless you are knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves throughout the body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of ulcers that are morphea.
When an ulcer is old and no medicinal ointment helps, then cauterize over it with a cautery, applying a little heat according to the severity of the ulcer, until the whiteness and discoloration are removed, and the colour of the affected area is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils mixed with rosemary oil and leaves of arnica, and with a portion of pigeon blood or swallow blood (each), all mixed together.  Then bandage the area with a cloth and apply it until healed.
Chapter 50.
Of the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is starting and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, in the same way it is wrapped.
And the learned say it should be cauterized with the back cautery in the middle area; but I do not see that, for I fear it will be ulcerated, and I have seen that happen several times.
And it is more correct that it should be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 11.
Of cauterization of tumors.
When a tumor is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the excess of its formation, or the age of the patient, for they are old and frail, with little blood, or due to time, and you want to accelerate the maturation of the tumor; then cauterize around it with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it alone, for it will hasten its maturation.
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:  and place it in the middle of the tumor until it pierces through the skin.
And if the cautery is in a lower location, so that the arm's condition is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Of the cauterization of corrosives.
A corrosive is a wandering corruption in the limb, which corrodes it as if a fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if that corrosive is in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, then you should use cauteries with small, or large points, according to what is appropriate for the location where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire corruption and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply a dressing of oil mixed with lint to the cauterized areas until the scabs are all eradicated and all corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-regenerating ointment.
But if after three days you see healthy flesh growing where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes a corrosive medicine is used, for it acts as a substitute for cautery. But cautery with fire is a more immediate remedy.
And I have already described the treatment with a sharp medicine in the division, so use it when you need it.
Chapter 53.
Of cauterization of ulcers and other similar afflictions.
Many times, in the lower parts of the diseased foot, a disease called an ulcer forms, and is a large, festering sore, which afflicts the foot; and cauterization in those cases is done in two ways: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is to ignite a concave cautery, resembling a kind of small vulture, which is made of iron, according to the size required to contain the ulcer completely, and made of fine edges.
And then place that ignited cautery on the ulcer, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circular motion over the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer. And leave it there for three days until it begins to discharge pus. And then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for that will uproot it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you must apply cauterization with water.  Take a cannula of bronze or iron or the wing of a vulture, and place it over the ulcer.  Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand, and move it in a circular motion with pressure all around. Make sure the edge of the cannula is pressed against the root of the ulcer, and the hot water will reach the root of the ulcer.  Wait a little for the patient to feel the effects of the hot water for about an hour, and then remove it, for the ulcer with its roots will be eradicated.
And thus do with those and then with the others until you have treated all those affected on the body.
And then treat those wounds, since the roots of the ulcers have been eradicated with these ointments, which cause the flesh to regenerate.
Chapter 54.
Concerning the cauterization of tremors.
When someone has tremors due to cold in the nerves, or due to a cold fever, or another similar cause, then you should cauterize that person with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and use a cautery on their feet, and an olive-oil cautery on their stomach.
And the tremor in him subsides, and hastens the health of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
Concerning the cauterization of white spots (or blemishes) on the body.
When white spots, or pustules and fissures appear on the body, caused by corrupted thick matter; then, at the outset, as soon as they appear, it is necessary to cauterize the entire head of the fistula with a thin cautery made of myrtle wood, the tip of which is heated; or with the roots of long-leafed herbs; or with a lens-shaped cautery.
And sometimes a cauterizing agent is added at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; and if they are not believed and the superfluity is broken up by these means, they are cured by these means.
However, this must be done alongside bloodletting.
Chapter 56.
Of cauterization of accidental blood flow by arrow incision.
Many times there is blood flow from an arrow wound that cuts toward the affected area, or toward an incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and similar cases, and it is difficult to control that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, you should hold the arrow wound opening with your hand, and place your index finger over it, pressing it repeatedly until the blood flow stops under your finger and does not come out again.
And then place the olive cauteries, small and large, in a number of them, in the fire, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of those, small or large, according to the location and wound where the artery is broken, quickly pressing it onto that vein after you've stopped the bleeding with your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding is cauterized and stopped.
And if the blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and lift the cautery, then take another cautery carefully from the cauteries prepared in the fire, and keep doing this repeatedly until the blood is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and to cause further harm to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not already extracted, for when it is extracted, the patient's extremities are more easily burned and the bleeding is stopped, or it is bound with a thread or bandage by firmly tightening, or medicaments whose virtue is to stop the bleeding are placed on it; and they are tightly pressed with a cushion with appropriate constriction.
However, whoever administers constriction with bandages or by applying burning substances, does not achieve success quickly.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present nor is there medicine, then stop the bleeding by applying pressure with the index finger over the opening of the vein as we have said, and apply great pressure until the blood is stopped in the primary part of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from over the wound; and over the wound, sprinkle with very cold water until the blood has congealed and thickened;  and more care should be taken where cauterization or medication is needed.
Of incisions, perforations, leeches, phlebotomy, wounds, and similar matters.
We have already stated in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire is appropriate, along with burning medicines, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments necessary for those cauteries, along with the forms of those cauteries; and I have organized the chapters from the supremacy of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker may be relieved of this, concerning whatever he has inquired about.
And before I begin this, children, it is necessary to understand that in this chapter the content is similar to the first chapter on cauterization.
And for that reason, great caution is needed, for in the operation described in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs, which is with blood, the lifeblood, from the incision of a vein or an incision over an abscess or the opening of a wound or the purification of a sore or the removal of an arrow or the incision of a stone, and their similar cases. And with all of those [actions] are associated fear and trembling, and in them often comes death.
And I warn you that this, which brings forth danger, should not befall you, for sometimes in the treatment of men with numerous illnesses, [dangerous] situations may arise. And of these [situations], some will be angered by their illness, and death is easy for them, and this is due to the intensity of their illness, and the duration of their illness, and the illness itself is a fear that signifies death.
And among those is the one who gives you their possessions and says, "You hope for their health," and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to the one who comes to you with this kind of treatment; and your caution should be greater than greed and your rashness; and do not presume any cause for it except for certain knowledge that verifies it for you, and that leads to a praiseworthy outcome.
And in the treatment of all your patients, use prognosis and indication of the way to health, for in that is help for you in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold direction and protection from you, for that is in his hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, concerning the treatment of the head to the feet, so that what you seek and require concerning this may be made easier for you.
First chapter.
Of the treatment of water which is contained in the head of children.
Know that this illness often occurs in children after birth and when the nurse tightly holds the child's head without support.
And sometimes it arises from a hidden cause that is unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those I saw, death resulted, and therefore I leave the treatment of it to others.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and its head was always thus enlarged until it could no longer support itself due to the size of its head, and that the moisture increased until death.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the scalp and the bone, or accumulated beneath the bone, on the skull.
When the operation is on this part, if the moisture is between the scalp and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to cut into the middle of the head with a fissure, and the length of the fissure should be about two inches until the moisture flows out.  This is the method for treating the swelling/abscess.
And therefore, if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures to be made in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of this is that you see the seams of the skull opened on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press on it with your hand in those areas and it's not hidden from you. You must cut into the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
Then remove all the moisture from the incision.  Then compress the fissures with cloths and bandages.  Then apply wine and oil to the wound until the fifth day, then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with dressings and ointments, and support the head evenly; and have the patient eat dry foods with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, considering where the size of the abscess and collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore, make the incision where the abscess and the fluid collection are most apparent, and do it in the manner that seems best to you.
And be careful not to cut the artery, so that blood does not flow and kill the patient through that blood flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Second Chapter.
When there is a persistent cold or inflammation in the eyes or the feet, and the usual treatments with medicine are not effective, then the final cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incise those (arteries) if the illness affects the head, first rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries are made visible, and then tie the patient's neck with a cloth; then, consider where the vein pulsates; and mark the locations of each of them near the ears, for they are hidden in some individuals.
And then, mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with a sharp instrument with an incision that reaches the bone, and this is done over the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the instrument under the artery and cut it at the incisions on either side.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers together, for when any vein is cut, the blood is released with a pulsating outflow, which spurts out with frequent spurts.
However, if the artery is not visible, then you must measure from the ear a distance of three fingers, then mark with a probe, and cut to the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be drawn is about a wine cup, and more or less will be drawn depending on the strength and filling of the patient's artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of inflammation remains on the bone, then cut away that so that a festering abscess does not develop.
And then press the wound with lint and strips of cloth, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When you encounter a persistent headache or a sudden severe pain, due to acrid humors and the quality of the tissues of the temples, or a similar severe and persistent pain, and it is not treated by the usual methods of medicine, then in these conditions we have found effective the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or the cauterization of those, as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient shaves the hair in the temples; and identifies the artery appearing in the temple, because it is visible to you through its pulse, and is hidden from most people due to the severity of the cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's head should be firmly wrapped with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or warm water to make the artery visible. And then you take the instrument, of which this is the shape: And then you carefully scrape the artery with that instrument until you reach the artery; and then you cut it in parts to remove it from the artery, and expose the membranes beneath it, from all sides.
But if the artery is delicate, then wrap it with the end of the lancet, and then cut it in a portion that is proportional to the lengthening and shortening of the extremities, and a flow of blood will not occur, for if it is not cut completely the blood will not all flow.
And then drain the blood by a quantity of one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk or with ropes, and do not loosen it before the wound is healed, otherwise there will be a flow of blood.
And then cut the excess that is between the two ligaments; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that with a cautery, going down to the bone with a scalpel cautery, until its extremities are cut, and the same operation will then be done.
And it is better if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot temperament; for cautery is of those things that help to eliminate harmful moisture, and therefore it is better in a beneficial way.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the area be filled with old cotton, and powders made properly be placed on it, and afterwards be treated with drying medicines that make flesh grow and with certain dressings until it is healed.
And if during the operation, there is a bleeding from the artery, at that time you must try to stop the blood, either with cautery, or by filling the area with cotton, and pressing your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those things are available to you, then place your finger over the area until the blood is coagulated, and apply water of intense coldness to the area until the pain subsides, and it is tightened as needed.
And the easiest way in extracting an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two knives, since you have marked the two places with a probe, and placing each one, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities is stretched, because it is not completely consolidated by this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two knives is sufficient. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two knives, it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives, it is near to each other, and it does not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those areas, the heat of the fire is held in those places and the flesh is cut easily.
And this method is best of all and the easiest.
And the space between the two knives should be the width of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of bodies suffering from acute and acrid humors of the oils.
When the humors are acrid, and the vessels on the top of the head are affected, and you find no medicinal cause for the cure, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and feels a crawling sensation on their forehead, as if ants were crawling, and the oils are weakened, dampened to the point that their skins are apparent, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acridity of the tears, the ancients, experienced in the treatment of such cases, used a specific technique for this treatment, and called that treatment "spassa".
And you command the patient to shave the hair on their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, following the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers, the first incision should be equidistant from the nose's length in the middle of the forehead, the second should be a little further along the movement of the muscles around the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries which run along both sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of both jawbones. And the space between each incision should be about three fingers wide.
And if you have a prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which you can absorb the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two pointed ends, of which this is the shape of the incision: which is from the temples to the second incision. Scrape away with that all the flesh that is between the two incisions, using the chisel which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that instrument against the flesh adjacent to the tissue, and the blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But continue the incision to that part of the tissue, and then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And when a quantity of blood flows, squeeze the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old cloth, and place on those powders mixed with wine, oil, and vinegar, and make sure it does not become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basil ointment with roasted oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the treatment of sores and ulcers descending from the parts within the head.
When a patient has sharp and persistent sores, and the ulcers on the patient's body are small and weakened, and their appearance is poor, and the eyelids are ulcerated and hair loss is occurring, and there is sharp pain and subsequent exhaustion on the scalp, then know through these symptoms that the sores and abscesses originate from numerous veins deep within the head.
And the best treatment for this is this: order the patient to lie down, and then make a small incision in the center of the forehead, from the left temple to the right temple (and begin with an incision from the left temple to the right temple; and make the incision down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the temporal lacerations which are commonly sore near the chewing muscles), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the gap between the two edges of the incision with old cloth or linen bandages. And then apply a poultice made of powders mixed with wine and oil so that a painful abscess does not form.
And when you have removed this and see that the abscess is reduced, then it is necessary to clean the bone until it begins to grow flesh, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth, just as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, mix them, and from this create a plaster to be applied to these wounds to stimulate flesh regeneration.
Chapter 6.
Of the treatment of that which affects the ears.
Every ailment affecting the ears belongs to one of four types: either it is a mineral or something similar to a mineral, like iron or glass; or it is plant-based, like cedar or beans; or it is a flowing substance, like water or sour wine and their like; or it is some kind of animal.
And therefore, when a stone or other similar substance that does not belong nor grows in the ear enters it, and you place the ear in the sun, and the stone is loosened, then instill into it some kind of perfumed oil or balm, and then apply an extraction method, and make it sneeze with medicine, and plug its nostrils to prevent the expulsion of the sneeze. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear outwards, for often it is forced out by these methods.
And if it is not forced out, then administer an extraction with the instrument called a *gesti epicicarios* [small spoon-like instrument for ear extraction], of which this is the shape:
And if it is forced out with the instrument, good; and if not, then administer an extraction with a small, slightly curved spoon.
And therefore, if it is not forced out by that, then make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening, and seal around the tube with softened wax and oil so that only the tube remains open. Then extract with your breath with strong suction, for often this is effective with what we have described.
But if it is not forced out in this manner, then take a heated, or pre-warmed, piece of cloth, a small amount, and place it on the end of the ear, then gently wrap it around that cloth. And then gently insert that into the ear opening, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not forced out by all the methods we have described, then you must consider cutting it out before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the way to cut it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to its effect, and then place the cut between your hands, and turn the ear towards the upper parts, and make a small incision at the base of the ear towards its cartilage, in a well-pressed location. Let the incision be shaped like a crescent moon until it reaches the stone, and, once the stone is found, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; then close the incision immediately, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause of the swelling in the ear is one of the growths that swells and becomes inflamed, then administer the cure and extraction of it; but if you do not comply with this, then take a thin, subtle substance in this manner: And administer with that the excision of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already been moistened by the ear's vapor; instead, put it into small pieces, and remove them with tweezers or with a subtle technique, or with a small incision, as we have mentioned; for this makes the removal easier.
However, if water has entered the ear, the patient should initially use sneezing, filling the ear with some old cotton, and lying down on the affected ear. If the water is thus expelled, it is good; otherwise, take small, smooth stones about the length of a finger and heat them slightly in the fire.  The patient should then insert one of these stones into the ear canal, and then tap the stone with another stone on the part of the head above the affected ear. Therefore, continue this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, continue this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And when the water is thus expelled, take some paper or linen, place one end of it in the ear and hold the other end with a fire until the majority of it burns.
And then put in more linen and repeat this as many times as necessary until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a tube, as was described above for the stone extraction.
However, in the removal of a small animal (or similar) that has entered the ear, treat it as described in the section on smaller objects; but if it is a large object that appears to be in the ear canal, then extract it with instruments and forceps, as this is easier than other things that enter the ear.
However, in the removal of a worm that has grown in the ear, if you treat it as described in the section on smaller objects and in the treatise on distillation and your treatment does not improve it, then you should expose the ear to the sun's rays.
And thus, if any sign of worms appears, remove them with delicate instruments or forceps; but if no sign appears, then take a narrow-mouthed, wide-mouthed tube, of which this is the form: Insert the thin end of the tube into the ear according to how much the patient can tolerate; then, strongly suck with it, repeating this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if this does not work, then you should seal and close the end of the tube with wax, as previously described.  Then apply distillations that are known from ancient treatments for worms, and these can be found in the treatise on distillations.
And use the method of pouring medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, of which this is the form: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole at the top, and flat on the surface.
And so it should be used to push what is in the cavity of the tube, wherever necessary. And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its end suitably with wool.  Then, pour oil into the cavity of the ear, or the juice of an herb, or whatever medicine you want, into the tube.  Place the reed covered with wool inside the ear, and press gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is poured into the ear should be slightly warmed by fire. And be careful that the substance you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Of the treatment of ear congestion.
Sometimes children inherit this from their mothers' wombs, and sometimes it occurs in adults,  a congestion in the ear canal caused by a plaque or a growth; and this congestion sometimes occurs at the opening of the ear canal, preventing the passage of fluid, and sometimes it's in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the opening of the ear, which does not allow the passage of fluid, is in the most difficult situations to cure.
And in that which allows the passage of fluid, you should place the patient's ear towards the sun and observe it. And therefore, if congestion appears, open it with a very small instrument, of which this is the form:
If its extremity has a small width, with one part sharp and the other not; and the instrument has two thin ends so that it does not damage the ear.
And therefore, if the congestion is due to flesh growing in the ear or in its canal, then remove it with small hooks and cut it out with vigorous ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the congestion is in the front of the ear, then take a thin, slender rod and warm it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have detected congestion with which the patient finds difficulty in hearing, ease the pressure on it gently; and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear.
And then place on the ear a cloth, fitting the width of the opening that you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for some days until you are certain of the wound's healing; or that you take some and soak it in water and powder over it, thoroughly crushed, and use it; and if the ear seems to be already abscessed, then you should extract the pus and replace it with another pus-covered cloth wound in a cerate made from rose oil until the abscess is subdued; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cool water and place it over the ear, and use another treatment that constricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of the swelling which comes to the eyelids.
Swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes sometimes is moist, sometimes is dry.
Therefore, you must hold them with forceps or tweezers, and separate them from their roots with a spatula, and then apply a poultice to the affected areas.
But if pain with blood flow comes, then you cauterize them with a thin, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is close to the incisions, and often times they return when some cause remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids.
Often, in the eyelids, a cause resembling swelling in its strength and hardness is present, and therefore it is called swelling.
And it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the procedure for them is that you should consider if the swelling is originating in the area visible on the eyelid and is spread in all directions; and the cause of it is slight.
Therefore, make a cut across it (the swelling) with a scalpel, and then scrape it away from all sides easily until it subsides, and then suspend it (the eyelid) with a forceps and cut it away.
And if the swelling is large, then you should close it with stitches; and heal it until it is cured.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you because the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the swelling is growing inwards from the eyelid's surface, then lift the eyelid, suspend the swelling with forceps, rather than making an incision, and press it from every side.  And if the eyelid is stretched by the incision, that is of no consequence.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and heal the area with something that promotes healing until it is cured.
Chapter 10.
Of the treatment of a cyst on the eyelid above the eye.
A cyst is a swelling that is generated in the eyelid's tissues, and it is more common in children, it aggravates the eyes of those afflicted and causes them difficulty in the morning; and they cannot look at the sunlight because of it, because tears accumulate around it.
And because of this, you see them lying on their faces constantly, and they sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below their eyebrows are wet, which has already become swollen, and the appearance of a cyst is imminent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel a cyst there.
And a method of operation is this: have the patient rest their head on your lap, and then place a cloth over them and heat it, and make a circle around the size that contains the whole cyst, and then place that over it and press with your fingers to make the cyst gather in the middle of the circle, then pierce the middle of that wetness with a small incision with a slit, and the slit should not be larger than the slit that is made in bloodletting.
But in the process, you must cut through the skin completely until you reach the cyst, because in most cases the cyst proceeds through a slit like a white grease.
Then remove it with cloths that you have wrapped around it with your fingers on the outside and twist it between your right and left hand until it is gone.
And be careful not to press too hard into the slit, so that with the incision you don't pierce the eye and damage it.
But if the cyst does not appear at the beginning of the incision, but you gently press into the slit until the cyst proceeds; then remove it as we have said; and then soak cloths in vinegar and warm water and place them over the area, and press them down with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to absorb any remaining moisture.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if there is a hot abscess in the area, then treat it with cooling poultices until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Methods of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, there form lumps beneath the natural skin and become hardened, they press on the eye and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids and tissue, to the point of causing damage to the eye, which is called "tactinir" of the eye.  It is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine as previously described in the chapter on cautery; or the tactinir is treated by incision and suture; or by canes, as I will describe.
And therefore you should place the patient's head on your lap; then gently lift the eyelid with your left hand, and if it lifts easily, that is good.  If not, insert a needle into that part of the under eyelid where the problem is, pushing the needle through the eyelid.  Do this – near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow – close to the hairs, and pull the lump outwards through the eyelid and then lower the eyelid.
Then, in the part beneath the eyelid, under the hardened hairs, pierce with a spatula from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.  Then remove the lump and place beneath the eyelid small powders of cotton or cloth, and then gently press on the eyelid with a probe, creating a shape similar to a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape must be adjusted according to how much the eyelid is raised, for this varies in different cases, and some cases require a larger incision in the eyelid, corresponding to how much the eyelid has softened.
And then, using the spatula, trace along the two lines you've drawn, starting from the larger tear duct and continuing to the smaller tear duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, it should be as wide as the king's finger.
And then place a compress on one of the two corners of the wound. Then scrape the entire area, and then use stitches to close the two lips with fine wool or thread. Clean the blood, and apply any excess thread to the two eyebrows with some adhesive substance, if desired; otherwise, do not bother.
And then leave the stitches in place for three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is lifted towards the wound's sealing and adhesion; however, stitches are better.  Thus, the ancients of this tradition say this.
But nonetheless, be diligent with the patient, and it is good practice, and do not be afraid.
And there is another method in this tradition, which is to draw a figure on the eyelid like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three separated and grouped tweezers in this manner:
But if that is not possible, hold the tweezers, and this is not appropriate, then take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the figure, and place the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads with equal tension between your fingers, and then, with a coordinated upward motion, lift the entire flap above the drawn figure as we have described.
And then stitch together the two edges of the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with plasters and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes the eyelid's eyelashes become inverted, in which case you should use what we have said about incisions; however, a suture in each case is more artful/skilled.
To cauterize with reeds is according to this form/method: and you should turn the eyelid and cut the figure within it as I have described; and then, by skill, make two thin reeds or sticks whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the gap. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you hold the threads.
Then carefully attach each one to the excess skin of the eyelid, and tightly bind the reeds at each part, and leave it for a few days, because the skin will die due to the constriction and will become loose and decompose until it falls off on its own.
However, if it has taken too long, then break it with tweezers, and then treat the wound until it heals.
Thus, once it is healed, the eyelid is raised and the skin is not irritated.
And this is the method for two reeds, which you will do in this way: and have a length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of lifting irritated skin with a needle when the skin is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough hairs irritating the skin, then the procedure for them is that you take a fine needle and place it on a very fine and thin piece of linen or silk, and then carefully adjust the ends of it, placing each one in a very subtle manner. And the length of the linen threads should be about one palm's width.
And then you place another fine thread beneath it, briefly, and use the ends of that if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on your lap, and position it near the light so that your work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
Then insert the needle into the root of the hair that needs treatment, and carefully pierce the eyelid quickly until you extract the foreign hair from the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out and put it into a container, and there should be one, two, or three hairs, and no more.
Then pull your hand with the hair until the hair is removed from the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the container is pulled and the hair is not expelled, pull the container outward, using the medicated ointment you made with it, until the container is expelled from the wound.
And look at the wound, for then you will remove the container and the ointment, and everyone will wash and close the wound, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows there.
And if the hair is too short, then you take a long hair from the patient's natural hair, and lift it with that, or you let it grow until it is a suitable length, and then you lift it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of an injury that occurs on the upper eyelid.
When an injury, a laceration, occurs in the eyelid, and it is a contraction of the eyelid, when it is contracted upward, either on the right or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cauterization, and is called "leporine" (hare-lip shaped), and this laceration or injury is either natural or accidental, and is caused by poor healing from a wound, incision, or cauterization, or by similar poorly treated ailments.
The method of treatment in this case is to cut through the scar tissue and separate the edges of the wound, and place a piece of linen cloth between them, and bind them together until they heal.
And you should not use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do, the injury will return worse than it ever was before.
Use treatments that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice made of water infused with marshmallow root and linseed, or diachylon ointment (a type of medicated plaster), which has been liquefied with one of the oils. Soak the cloth in this preparation and use it for treatment.
And the key to your treatment is to break through any scar tissue that hasn't healed according to its original form.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing other than a correction of a healed injury that does not restore the area to its original form.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a healed injury that has occurred on the lower eyelid.
This healed injury, which occurs on the lower eyelid, is truly called a healed injury; and it can be either of natural or accidental origin.
But it is accidental if caused by a wound, a cut, cauterization, or other similar injuries.
And the way to operate on it is for you to take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and to make it pass from the tear duct on the left side to the tear duct on the right side, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh apart with the needle and stitch it with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula. And then if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that is good; but if not, take the thread and place it in the split, and with that, close the eyelid, and close the two fissures at the lower eyelid's edge.
And let the extremities of the two fissures be the two angles of the incision you made until they meet, and let the angle be formed where they join.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then remove the flesh as much as is needed at the sharp edge below it, that which is the eyelid.
And then bring together the separated parts and stitch them with the wool thread; and then treat them with the remedies we mentioned, softening ones and poultices, until healed.
And if it must be treated by fissure, suture, or cautery, then you should make a flat fissure on the skin of the eyelid, as previously described. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In summary, the treatment of a protruding or recessed cataract, during the operation, should proceed according to the specific type of cataract, and that comes in various forms.
And skilled craftsmen always prepare every possible method until they restore the shape to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient, according to what suits them, manages the operation and instruments with the greatest care.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in such a way that the eyelid is firmly attached to the white of the eye, and its natural movement and functions are restricted, then you should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it, or extend it with forceps.
And then you carefully cut the adhesion with a blunt instrument, avoiding sharp incisions, using a blunt edge so that the patient is not distressed by the procedure, and maintain the instrument to prevent it from damaging the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should be made in such a way as to easily separate the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you apply salt water to the eye, using it to wash; or you can apply a solution of lead dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with care, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and after three days use healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the incision of the nail and the protruding flesh of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, either nervous, and is like a hard, subtle chip; or non-nervous, like congealed white moisture, which when touched by an iron, or when forced to be taken with a forceps, is detached and the forceps do not stick to it.
And both types [of nails] begin from the major tear duct, gradually extending to cover the eye and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye.
But the way to operate on the incision is that the patient should rest their head on your lap, and then open their eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and then collect the nail with forceps of little width, and extend it to the upper parts. Then take a needle and insert into it a horse's or ox's or cow's hair, or similar, or strong thread, or gradually narrow the end of the needle, and place it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it with the needle, and bind the nail with thread; and extend it upwards, and scrape the nail's edge which covers the pupil with the hair. And thus you follow it with the hair until the back of it.
And then you cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a thin blade or small shears, and leave the natural tear duct tissue intact, so that cutting it does not cause a continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with a single forceps or thread, as we have said, and then scraped with a lion's tooth, of which this is the shape:
And be careful not to touch the cornea with the instrument, lest it be ruptured, and the pupil be pierced.
Then place a little powdered salt or a prepared poultice on the wound, and leave it on overnight; and then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive, and you cannot insert a needle, or forceps are not placed on it, then often this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division.
And if you want to cut it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a sharp, thin lion's tooth instrument, in this shape: with subtlety. And if it is often thin and fused and adheres to the root, then pour from your flask into the wound a poultice made of herbs or a red herb or powdered salt, and close the wound overnight.
And then repeat the operation until all that is on it has been removed, unless a hot abscess has formed in the wound. If so, you leave it, and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
If the lacrimal flesh (possibly referring to a swollen or infected area around the eye) is evident in the wound due to great harm, it should be suspended with a bandage.  Cut it away from that wound, but do not cut too deep, so as not to cause tears to flow.
Then apply a poultice of red herbs and herbs to the lacrimal area until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a boil or abscess and what arises from flesh congested in the wound.
Sometimes in wounds of some people, red flesh grows, and it overgrows until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or squeezes the eyelids and strongly presses the eyelids outward, and it resembles the roughness of a balustrade.
But the operation on him is that the patient should rest their head on your lap; then open the wounds there and collect all that flesh with appropriate forceps, and hold it with a pair of forceps or shears; then cut the flesh from the beginning until everything is finished with the scalpel, and be careful not to injure the wound in your operations.
And your incision shall be with that which you cut with, or with a spatula as we have described in the incision of a nail, or with small forceps, with which you collect the abscess, as will be shown according to the form of it in this chapter.
Then, when your incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, fill the wound with powdered salt or a red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place over the wound a cloth with egg white until the abscess is safely closed.
And if any cause of inflammation remains and a hot blood is present, and you fear a serious abscess, then leave the wound and treat that abscess with whatever subsides that inflammation, and then repeat the operation until it is healed, and similarly treat any inflamed flesh that occurs in the wound of this kind.
However, you must avoid all treatments of the wound by natural or accidental means, using iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the limb has tolerated the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus in the wound.
Pus comes in red spots that are clustered on the wound and prevents the healing process, and the wound must be treated for a long time.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the wound containing pus is severe and has no other ailment besides pus, then you collect that pus.
And you order the patient to place their head on your lap, and then apply those [red] spots with one ounce or two, according to your judgment; and that ounce should be of a fine, twofold preparation, in this manner:
or two ounces gradually mixed in one vessel according to this method:
And then those spots should be collected with delicate force, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood gradually, until you see those spots be removed from the wound and rolled up.
And be careful not to damage the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is during the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you only cut those spots.
And when you have finished, then you distil into the wound green or red juice, so that with its sharpness it may corrode what has been removed from the sore.
But if that is not possible for you to collect it all at once, then you apply a plaster to the entire area that relieves the pain, and leave it for several days until the pain subsides and a gentle inflammation is ensured.
And then repeat it according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nosebleed.
When you treat a nosebleed with a cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, after the narration of it and it is not healed, then there is no use in it, but rather you should lance the abscess just before it matures, and remove all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
And so, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called a "sharp head," and is made of iron, and the head is round, like a chisel, which is made pointed by filing or by finely scraping (as in the following form).
And place that on the corrupted area of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this is done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown in it, and the body is free from pus and remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and there is no abscess or other accident, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not healed, but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, in this manner: and you should uncover the second bone with iron or a sharp medicine, and when you have uncovered the bone, you should take a certain substance according to this form:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and the shaft of it be thin and tapered towards the tip, like this.
And then place that on the bone, and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand a little from the opening, and then turn your hand with the substance until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient will feel air escaping when he feels your hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent, drying medicines, as you have been taught.
So, when the flesh has healed and the area is hardened, then the material that had spread to the outside returns to the nose, and this is easier for the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the swelling of the nose.
When the nose swells completely and there is no accident of injury or diminution, then you should leave the patient alone, and then follow them, and then apply leeches to the neck without incision, and draw them for a good suction; then place on the nose a liniment made of acatra, aloe, and enses, and sarcocolla, and then bind a plaster on the nose with fine powders.
And the way of the powders is that you take very fine linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded in four folds; and make of those many.
And then place those one upon the other according to the amount the nose needs. And then bind over those with a strong, firm cloth; and repeat the leeches with suction without incision; and then remove the leeches and leave the nose bound tight day and night.
But if, meanwhile, the swelling is softened, then it should be bound very tightly.
And then remove the bandage at approximately the same time, day and night, as we have said.
And if the nose is already reduced, it is good, and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders, the binding and the leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the choroid layer.
When there is a rupture in the choroid layer, and it is protruding and pressing out from the eyelids like a bunch of grapes, and the shape of the eye is distorted by this, and you wish to incise it, then the procedure there is as we have recounted, that you insert a needle into the root of the choroid from the lower to the upper part, and then place another needle, which has a double thread attached to the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate, and leave the first needle in its position; and then you cut the area with the double thread and remove the part of the choroid along the needle's trajectory, and tighten that area firmly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white and leave it until the thread and the grape-like protrusion come away.
And then treat the eye with something that strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, gathering material from all around with a cloth circle to support a large protruding part of the eye, and then piercing it with a fine instrument to get to the eye's surface, and allowing the albuminous moisture to drain away, and the eye will descend and quickly settle back into place.
And then hold it firm until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of falconers.
This illness, called alconati, is nothing more than a fluid accumulation in the eye, resembling descending water, but it's not that.
But the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat.  Then, take their head in your hands in two places and hold it until you see the fluid (sanctuary) descend to the lower parts; then, it should be dried and not descend further, the light (sight) should be stopped, and the patient should see things as clearly as they can.
And if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid has not been prepared as we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands.  Then take a fine, soft cotton (spatum subtil) and, using it, dab gently on the conjunctiva (pannicol) near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea (in the hollow area/into the empty space), until the fluid is expelled.
Therefore, once it is expelled, then instill warm water into the eye, in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of eye water in the division, and which ones are suitable for puncturing with a lancet, explaining, then that which suits the health.
Then you should place the patient between your hands on a bed and bind his eye tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his eye if the eye with the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if the eye is the right eye.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
And then place the tip of the almond near the brow,  along the width of the ray (possibly referring to a blood vessel), on the white part of the eye near the smaller tear duct, and then gently press and rub the almond with your hand.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space (or cavity).
And it is necessary that the distance of the almond from the eye's anterior surface be equal to the space between the pupil and the edge of the dark area, which is the brow of the eye; for you will see with that pupil with the sight of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond in the location where the fluid is, and pull it down a few times, and if the fluid descends immediately, then tell the patient to immediately look at what is in front of their eye, and the almond in their eye.
And then rest for a while; if the fluid has descended, then you pause again before the almond is thrown out.
And then, when it is dried up and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently roll it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the fluid and wash the eye with it; and then place a cloth or stopper or wool infused in warmed oil and egg white over the eye and close it.
But we, and those of our time, place over this crushed [substance] egg white.
And if you are unable to insert your almond into the eye due to its hardness—for some people's eyes are very hard—then you should take the substance called "alberid," which has this form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva with it, and do not push your hand into the hole, but instead create a subtle path for the almond to follow.
And then insert the almond as we have said.
And to complete your work, have the patient prepared in a soundly made sleeping chamber, where he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and all movement is prohibited.
And apply this to his nature so that his nature is calmed, and do not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain according to its disposition until the third day.
And then, in that dark room, remove the bandage, and show him some sights, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the time of treatment or immediately after the infusion. Having done this, you must remove it because the water can easily cause great and vehement irritation.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you must remove the bandage before the seventh day, and treat it with what will cause the abscess to subside.
Then, you remove the bandage from him and place a bandage on his face, through which his vision is managed, keeping him in the dark room for a few days.
And gradually, he should be taken out of that room and brought back to his usual activities.
And know that in a complicated case, the student is not excused from observing it several times, and then you should be bold in your procedure.
And it has come to our attention from some of those who are in Artach, and some said that a fire was made at Ayrac, a hollowed-out place through which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has accomplished this, nor is it read in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of cauldrons so that whoever is ignorant of them may know them:
And they are made of earth or iron, properly, and their extremities are made with this triangular thinness, the sharp end in such a way as the form is.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various growths of flesh are born in the nose, some of which have a cause resembling a scorpion's tail, or a fish's polyp; and this illness is called polyps because it resembles that represented fish. And from it is cancerous, ulcerated flesh, of dark color; and from it is lion flesh not of dark color.
Therefore, in those growths of flesh which are not fraudulent or cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands, and placed in the sun, and clear the patient's nostrils, and poke your lancet into those growths. And then remove that to the outside, and then separate what you have grasped from those with sharp, thin spatulas from one part until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any part remains from which excision is possible, then you must cut that with one of the sharp instruments with ease until nothing remains. But if it swells with blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is appropriate; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize and cut it until the blood is separated and all the cavities are removed.
And then put in the nose, after the incision, sharp wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is flesh and excessive pus on the bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Therefore, then it is necessary to introduce into it a piece of lead, which has some thickness, and make many small incisions, and place between each incision the quantity of a finger or less, and cut the diseased area and insert an extremity of the lead into the nose with the probe or with another instrument possible to do so.
And after this is done, draw the lead's scent in until it reaches the channels of the nose, and it comes out over their throat, for often the children in schools mimic this action, and it is an easy task for anyone who wants to do it.
And then place the two ends of the lead, one end emerging from the nose and the other remaining inside, and then cut away the flesh with the incisions that are in the lead, and do this until you know that the flesh is already with the incisions of the lead.
And then remove the lead, and place a poultice over the nose near the extraction of blood, and do this for three days or more until the ointment has corroded all that remains of the flesh.
And finally, place a lead tube in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you require a more extensive cure, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument for nasal purging, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And make this of silver or brass, which should resemble a small, open lamp, like a small shell, and similarly shaped.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and the tube of the nasal purging instrument should be flat, open; to which there should be a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when heating oil or water or whatever juices and subtle substances you want in it.
Chapter 25.
Of the ulcers that arise in the extremities of the nose.
Often an ulcer forms at the extremities of the nose, and it grows and worsens over several days until the sight of it is most distressing.
And therefore, you should incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. And then apply a cautery or a burning medicine to the area.
However, if its incision is delayed until it has grown, then consider if it is hard, dark-coloured, and insensitive. If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a hard, deep-seated abscess; because frequently, those who cut into this abscess suffer great harm from the resulting spread of disease.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not dark in colour, and if incision is possible throughout it, then drain the patient and cut it open without fear, and treat the area with things that dry and constrict until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, lips, and ears when their continuity is broken by plague or similar afflictions.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, you will achieve little in that operation except in skilled hands.
Therefore, when encountering any of those causes, consider if it's a fresh plague wound with its own blood, and if so, then you should rejoin the two lips of the wound with stitches, and then treat it until healed.
And if the lips of the broken continuity are already separated, and each is made whole, then you must scrape each part of their apparent edges until blood comes out. Then rejoin the two lips with stitches, and tighten them.  Powder the stitches with dragon's blood and crushed emery.  Place a piece of diaphanous plaster, or any other consolidating plaster, over the powder.  Leave it bound for two or three days, then remove it and replace the plaster.  Leave it until the pus has cleared, then treat with ointment until healed.
However, the method of stitching is that you join the break either with needles as we have described in abdominal sutures, or join the break with glue, as you have been taught.
Chapter 27.
Of extracting those things that are found between the two lips in the inner parts.
Often, in the inner parts of men's lips, some hard abscesses appear, resembling the seeds of grains, and some of these are smaller, and some are larger.
Therefore, you must turn back the lips and cut away each of those hardnesses from every side, and then fill the wound with a crushed herb until the bleeding stops, and then wash the area with sour wine and treat the area with a styptic agent, until it heals.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, flesh adhering to the gum, which the ancients called albulus, forms; in that case, you should hold it with tweezers or forceps and cut it at its base, allowing the pus or blood to run out.
And then apply crushed herbs or other styptic or drying powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, for with cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
About removing teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes black and yellowish or greenish scales form, causing gum decay and making the teeth sore.
Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, and place their head on your lap.  Clean the teeth where those scales and similar gritty substances appear, until no trace remains.  And do this to remove the blackness, yellowness, and other such things until they are cleaned.
If what is at the beginning of the procedure is removed, that is good; but if not, then repeat the procedure the following day, and again on the second and third days until you reach your desired outcome.
And know that teeth require many different kinds of tools and shapes, according to how you prepare for the operation. And therefore, the scraper used to scrape the inner portion of the tooth is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth in other ways, and these different scraper shapes you should prepare yourself, which you will see shortly.
Chapter 30.
Extraction of teeth.
You must treat the tooth's pain with every means and be thorough in every extraction, for there is no cause to hurry when extracting it, for it is a subtle substance within that must be dealt with during the extraction process.
However, when the patient requires a tooth to be extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is the painful one, for often the pain deceives the patient and suggests it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the experience of barbers.
Therefore, how should you be certain which tooth is painful, and that you know it well?  Then you should make incisions around the tooth with a substance possessing some virtue, until the tooth is detached from the gums on every side, and then gently remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little, until you dislodge it.
And then, apply strong pliers for good grip or strong leverage, and place the patient's head between your knees to hold it firmly so it doesn't move, and then pull the tooth straight, in a way that doesn't break it, and doesn't cause the patient further pain.
And if it is not completely dislodged, then take one of those instruments and gently place it under it from every side, and exert the removal force in the same way as you did at first.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you should cover that crack with cloth and compress it with a thin, sharp instrument so that it is not fractured during your application of pliers.
And you must carefully make incisions around the gum on all sides, and keep a good grip to avoid breaking it and leaving a piece behind; and return to the patient, for fear of causing greater pain than the initial discomfort.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their rashness and audacity when removing teeth, without administering what we have described; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are harder to treat than the original problem, and their roots remain, either all or some of them, or they pull out the tooth with some of the jawbone, as we have often witnessed.
And after the removal, rinse the mouth with warm wine or sharp wine with salt.
And if bleeding occurs, as often happens, then sprinkle some alum on the wound; and if that doesn't help, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers with which the tooth is initially grasped should be of long, slender jaws and a short, thick handle, so they do not bend when using them.
And they should be like that, with a thick handle, so that when you squeeze with them, the jaws don't bend; they should have short jaws.
And they should be made of Indian iron, with straight jaws; and on the jaws, there should be teeth that interlock and tighten with a strong constriction.  Sometimes, the jaws have the shape of a stork's beak (or similar pointed shape), and are very strongly constricting.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you need to remove a broken tooth that has some remaining cause, then you should place a cloth with lint over the area for a day or two until the area is softened; then, insert forceps or pliers whose jaws are shaped like the beak of a stork (or similar pointed shape), like the form of forceps:
The jaws of them should be made smooth like a file or a rasp.
And if you are unsuccessful with these forceps or pliers, then you must cut away at the root and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument called, for example, a small lever whose form is this:
And it should have a short, thick end, a little bit thick, and not be too thin so that it doesn't break.
Therefore, if the root is thus forcibly extracted, good; and if not, use these other instruments, whose shapes are: the first instrument has a triangular end, of some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is to have a triangular and more slender end.
And having used this instrument, now use another instrument with two handles, whose shape is approximately the following: and with other instruments, which I will describe later for scraping teeth; for it is useful with this instrument, which resembles a large spoon, and this is the form:
of a triangular, bent or short end, which should have some thickness, and not be sharp so that it does not break.
And you should know that the instruments for teeth are very similar to the other instruments.
But the skilled and subtle craftsman in the art, discovers for himself, according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify for him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not name or prescribe a specific instrument, due to the diversity of their forms.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth are fractured or decayed, then apply a remedy to it in its place with whatever is suitable from the instruments and forceps that we mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and assist with the technique, which is as follows:
And apply some small, gradual pressure, and hold it with a mouth-like device, so that it doesn't escape or leak until the bone is completely fixed; and afterward restore the area with suitable medications.
But if there is a small swelling on the bone, then remove that swelling and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth protruding above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, causing a misshapen form, especially in women, and especially in young, venerable women, then you must consider: if a tooth is directly adjacent to another tooth, and separation or suture is not possible, then remove it; but if it is not adjacent to another tooth, then you should cut it using a tool of this shape, resembling a pig's snout, made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And your incision should be made over several days, due to the tooth's hardness, so that it does not damage the other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is exposed to filing, then file it using an Indian iron file, of which this is the shape:
And it should be entirely made of Indian iron, easily marked; and it should have very small points, like the files used for making needles, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then, finally, line it and remove its roots with small razors.
And if a part of the tooth is fractured and the tongue is injured, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of the fracture is removed and smoothed, and filled so that the tongue is not irritated, and the speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of restoring damaged teeth with gold or silver filings.
When teeth are damaged by impact and removal through blows or by a fall, and the patient cannot hold what is missing, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then, so that it does not decay, it is better to fill those that are broken with gold filings and not silver, because silver turns green and can become spoiled after a few days, but gold never changes.
And the filings should be so fine and thick according to the amount that can enter between the teeth; and the method of application is to take the filings and place double the amount between two healthy teeth, and then to join two twisted portions of the filings between the broken teeth, or if there is one or many, until the material reaches the sound tooth on the other side. And then repeat the process until the starting point, and gently and skillfully compress it until it is no longer broken.
And your pressure, with which you press the filings against the tooth roots, should be such that it does not escape.
And then you trim the excess filings with forceps or pliers, and place them in each place with precision, and mold them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the broken tooth, so as not to injure the tongue. And then leave it thus compressed and secure.
However, if it is loose or broken, compress it or them with other filings in such a way at all times.
And this is the method for teeth, and the manner of correcting two broken teeth and two healthy ones, as often happens in these situations:
And when one or two teeth are returned to their correct position, and they are regrown as we have described, and remain stable.
And only skilled and wise artisans can do this.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is fashioned into a tooth shape, and placed in the gap where the tooth is missing, and is compressed as we have said, and remains in service for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the binding of the ligament which is in the tongue and prohibits speech.
This ligament, which is sometimes under the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a wound that has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth, their head resting on your own; you lift their tongue, and then cut that nervous ligament along its length until the tongue is freed from its constriction.
But if there is any hardness or knotting in that area, and this is from the healing of a wound, then you apply a cautery and cut through it along its length until you have severed the ligament and the knot has been broken.
And be careful not to create a fissure in the underlying flesh, and that you don't accidentally cut through a blood vessel and cause a flow of blood.
And then wash the site of the incision with water or sour wine or cold water; and then place a linen under the tongue; this is a medicament the patient should keep under their tongue every night so that it does not heal again.
But if you cause a flow of blood, place powdered vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding continues, then cauterize the area with a cautery appropriate for this purpose. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the extraction of a ranula (or cyst) under the tongue.
Sometimes, an abscess forms under the tongue, resembling a small tumor, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows significantly, filling the mouth.
And the procedure for it is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the abscess.
And if you see it to be dark in color, or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation there, then do not touch, for that is a cancer.
And if it has turned whitish, indicating moisture, then you place a probe there and carefully cut it with a sharp scalpel, and divide it into sections.  If blood flows during your procedure, then you apply pressed, crushed zegi (likely referring to a type of medicinal material, possibly alum or a similar astringent), that is, vitriol, until the bleeding stops.
And then return to your work until you have completely removed it, and wash it with sharp wine and salt; and treat it with further remedies until it heals.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses from both ears and those that are on the neck, and of other abscesses.
When there is a boil on the throat, these are glands that are gathered together, which burst outwards and are called boils, the ones that when treated with what we have discussed earlier and do not heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and insensitive; then do not touch it with an iron.
And if it is reddish in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron for the sake of blood flow; rather, let it mature, and then either you will lance it, or it will burst open on its own.
And if it is whitish, soft, and its root is subtle, then that is what needs to be incised.
And the operation on it is that you should consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already been calmed by adequate rest or if it has diminished with some reduction; and then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and let their head be in your lap, and open their mouth, and the attendant holding their hands, press the patient's tongue downward with a very special instrument, the shape of which is:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a knife.
Therefore, as you press the tongue with it and the abscess is shown to you, and you have positioned your sight on it, then take a lancet and insert it into the swelling, and pull it outwards to the sides as much as possible. After that, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut it with an instrument that has this shape:
After that, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut it with an instrument that has this shape: and it is similar to forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is towards the other, very sharp, which should be made of hardened iron.
However, if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a scalpel of which this is the shape: And it should be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other.
And after you have incised one wound, cut the other in the same manner of incision, and then the patient will recover from the cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply water decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves, or similar astringent remedies until the flow of blood is stopped, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise around the two ears, and cut those according to what I have described in the incision of two wounds as well.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat.  This abscess was dark-colored, with little sensitivity, and it had almost completely closed her throat.  She was breathing with difficulty and had been forbidden from eating or drinking water, and she was close to death if it had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had created two channels/tunnels until it emerged through two openings.
Therefore, I treated it fistularly (by creating a channel) and inserted a probe into one of the openings.  I extracted a considerable amount of [pus/matter].  Then I cut/incised the area where I understood the other opening was, and then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, and inserted the probe into the abscess.
And then I excised a large portion of it, and only a little blood came from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was now clear, and she immediately began drinking water and soon ate food.  Thus, I continued to cut into that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in the same place, which I cut into until that one also healed.
So I cauterized the woman's throat, which was now healed; and after that I wandered about, not knowing what God had done to me.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision of a boil when it is abscessed.
When catarrh settles on the uvula, and it is abscessed and long, it is then called a perpendicular boil; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, it is called a boil.
However, when it is treated with what we have said in the section, and you do not find your treatment effective, and sometimes a boil that is already gone is subtle, then you must incise the one that is round and inflamed; and if it is of that length, and it is sanguineous, of a dark colour or black, and there is no feeling there, then you must test the incision, for there is fear for the patient in that.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, that you make the patient sit and press his tongue with an instrument that reveals its shape, and then put the lancet on the swelling, and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of two ulcers.
And you should only incise what is adjusted to the natural boundary without adding more, for if you incise further, you will worsen the patient's condition.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of two ulcers, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use a cautery without fear, and the way to cauterize it is only with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head on your lap, then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and then take the water, as described in the cauterization chapter, and apply it with a live coal. Make sure it is neither too thick nor too thin, and fill the cavity of the instrument that has this shape:
The end of the cavity where the medicine is placed should be like the cavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the ulcer.  The patient lies on their side so that any saliva or mucus from their mouth flows away from the medicine, to prevent anything from dripping down the patient's throat and irritating it.
Then place your hand with the medicine and press it against the uvula for half an hour until you see it blackened and calmed by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and dip the cotton into the medicine.  Insert the spoon with the cotton in a tube until the cotton adheres to the tube. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it to dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  Then, clean the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in broth, removing any remnants of the medicine. Wash with cool water, then apply an external ointment and internal remedies until healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less prone to fear.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with something more subtle than cautery or incision, as it is cured by fumigation in this manner: take calamint, yarrow, rue, rue, arabic scicados, chamomile, and similar herbs, and combine all, or some of them, in a pot, and simmer them in sour wine. The pot should be properly sealed, and a small hole should be made in the middle, over which a concave instrument of bronze is placed in this way; it should be made of silver or bronze.
And the tip should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is considerably softened.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry.  Beware not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, for it would worsen the abscess, and you should not do this unless the abscess is already ripe/mature.
But if you do not have this instrument, then take a reed and place a shell of an egg at its end, so that the patient's mouth is covered, as the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the removal of thorns and that which adheres to the throat and other things.
Often thorns or fish bones or some other thing adhere to the throat.
Then you must remove whatever of those is apparent, which you observe, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of a light, so that you may discern what is in the throat.
And whatever is hidden and unknown in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, because a thing adhering to the throat will be more easily expelled by vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or have the patient take a piece of dry sea sponge, and tightly bind it with linen, and the patient will then swallow that, for when it reaches the place where the thorn is, it will be expelled. Or take an eel and drink it wrapped in linen, and it should be swallowed whole and quickly be drawn out; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly withdraw it.
But if it is not expelled by these methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this way:
And it should be a little larger than a fingernail, and at its tip there should be a cavity which you can easily insert into their throat.
And have the patient hold their head up high, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that it does not hurt them, and with that you will push the bone or thorn, or the doctor will do it with his hand.
But if the patient themselves can better, by their knowledge of the place of the related cause, push it down, and pull their hand with the instrument up, all according to the quantity that has been prepared until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of blood-sucking parasites attached to the throat.
When a leech is treated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not work, then consider the leech on the patient's throat in the sun, after you have pressed the patient's tongue with the instrument we have described.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small knife or with skillful, gentle hand gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat) and keep the patient away from water all day.
And then take a bowl full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth to it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not let the patient swallow anything and keep the water in place with their hand for an hour, because as soon as the leech feels the water, it will detach.
But if it is not dislodged by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with incense or asafoetida using the instrument we described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it falls.
And there is another method of fumigation for this: you take a bowl containing burning charcoal, and the bowl is covered with a cover in the middle of which there is a hole, and the tip of the instrument is placed in this hole; and then start the fumigation; and the patient should place their mouth on the end of the cannula, and close their mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will fall as soon as this occurs.
And if it does not fall, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and give them salty foods and herbs, and do not let them drink water, and with this regimen it is necessary that it be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is treated from the throat when it is visible; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, except that it has some curvature in it. which is placed on the throat, and its tip is like a crane's beak, which is gloved, on which a file is applied, so that when grabbing something, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and the incision of them.
Abscesses are many types, of many manners, according to their remembrance, each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their puncture and incision in two ways, of which one is through the type of abscess itself; and through what we take from the humors.
And the second way is concerning the locations on the body where they occur, for the abscess occurring in the head is different from the abscess occurring in the buttocks; and the abscess in a fleshy area is different from the abscess occurring in a joint; and for each of these there is a judgment for treatment.
And some abscesses should not be incised until the pus in them is mature or until they are fully formed.
Other abscesses should be lanced when they are inflamed and not yet fully formed, as with abscesses near joints.  For an abscess near a joint, its presence extends until what is in its surroundings can be dealt with, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are often severely damaged, causing contraction of that limb.  Or the abscess is near a major part of the body; if you delay lancing it until it matures, it might spread to the major part. Or it is near the buttocks; in that case, lance it while still inflamed.  You should not lance an abscess that's inflamed but not fully formed, unless it is near the buttocks, lest the infection spread to other parts within the buttocks and create a fistula or an incurable condition. However, you must know the proper time for lancing an abscess, and this is when it is mature.
And you know it is mature when there is cessation of pain and fever, and a decrease in swelling and throbbing, and a clarity in the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And therefore, the incision must be made in the pus-filled area beneath the abscess, and out of the swelling that comes from healing the prominence.
And the incision should always be made along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the limbs or feet, and away from the tendons, nerves, and arteries; and, in short, in all such places where there is no reflection.  For in those places where there is reflection, use an incision suitable to that part of the body.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave the incision until the digestion of the area, as we have said, is confirmed.  For if you incise it before this, you prolong the duration of the sickness and the foulness within, and it makes the edges of the wound hard and the depth worse.
However, some abscesses must be incised according to the breadth of the flesh or body, depending on the necessity, or as dictated by the affected limb.
And you must administer a small incision for small abscesses, and a large and wide incision, or many incisions, for large abscesses, according to the varying sizes of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which the cavity must be scooped out and incised when it is done properly, in order that it may drain, as happens with boils and buboes.
And some are incised with a three-angled cut; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses on the joints.
And some are given a round or crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones.
But those which are not like that, such as superficial abscesses, you should pierce superficially, or simply cut flat.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should pierce it and do not try to remove all the pus at once.  Having removed a portion, you should then close the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and repeat this several times according to the degree until it is completely drained.
And especially if the patient is frail, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly, decrepit person, for the animal spirit is often weakened by the discharge of pus, and the patient often dies quickly, and you should be cautious with their treatment.
Observe this chapter with great care, and when making your incisions into these abscesses, clean the sores and then consider whether the abscess wound is small, or a flat incision; in this case, you apply liniments or old lint.  But if the abscess is large, and the incisions are numerous, then you must put a medicament into each opening until they join together.
And if, in the abscess, a portion of the skin has been separated or has been cut away around the area, then you should fill it with old lint or with cloth strips, as when you have pulled out splinters or thorns, without moisture; and compress it until the third day.  Then you should treat and heal it with appropriate ointments until it is cured.
But if a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then you should apply cold water and vinegar in which you have soaked a linen cloth, and place this over the bleeding area many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must apply the regimen and remedies, and powders, which are described in many places in this book and in different sections.
However, if it is wintertime, and the abscess is located near many nerves, then you should mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply this to the affected area.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders mixed with water and oil, or with wine and oil, and keep it cool until the third day, as we have said.  Then you should drain the abscess, clean it, and apply the appropriate remedies until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for understanding the treatment of abscesses in general; however, I have already described how to treat each type of abscess in detail in separate chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses that arise on the neck of the head.
Small abscesses form on the neck of the head, and they are often like lumps that contain membranes surrounding them; and their contents are often thick.
And from them come pus, and this pus contains moisture similar to lime. And some of these contain moisture similar to dust, and others like them; and some of them are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of these there is no fear, as extracting them does not cause opposing archery.
And the procedure for the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is similar to this, which is called a probe, until you know what they contain.
If what it contains is moisture, then divide it with an incision along its length by a superficial incision in this manner:
And begin the incision along the line from B to G.  Then, when the moisture has been evacuated, you scrape off the skin that contained that moisture, and leave nothing of it, because it often returns if any part remains.
Then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if available, and otherwise in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, because with this you corrode any remaining skin particles.
And then apply more Egyptian ointment to the cotton a second and third time, if needed, until you are confident that no part of the skin remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains greasy matter, then you incise it in this manner: with an incision shaped like a cross, and insert hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane containing it.
But if your efforts are unsuccessful, then do as I told you before.
And do the same for a calcified abscess in terms of incision and treatment as we have described; and incision on a calcified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head of some men, with no moisture at all;  the reason for this is that I incised an abscess on the head of an elderly woman and found the abscess as hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if one were struck by it, it would hurt.
But in other abscesses on the head, this is not the case, as with abscesses that occur on the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, but the incision of all of these should be superficial.
And make the perforation in those from the lower part so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lower parts.
And then treat them with what is appropriate for their treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas which occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck, armpits, and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those which occur on the neck, and many are generated among them, and every scrofula of those is within its own tunic, and thus as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for of those some are stony, and of those some contain moisture, and of those are malignant ones which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that which you find to be well-disposed upon feeling, whose apparent color is similar to that of the codena (a type of swelling), and is soft in all directions, and is not attached to the neck's nerves, veins, or arteries, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, along a line from G to B, and drain it thoroughly, and spread the edges of the swelling with forceps, or many forceps if needed, as we said about abscesses on the head, and remove it little by little.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And if the swelling is not very acute, do not use a deep incision with your hand, or distress the patient, or cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and your operation prevents it, then apply powdered vitriol or other powders that stop bleeding, and compress the wound, and leave it until the inflammation subsides and the wound softens and begins to suppurate. When the blood is removed.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then examine with your index finger if there are any other small causes of scrofulous sores, then cut and clean those.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the scrofulous sore, it is necessary then not to cut that sore from its roots. Before that, you must tie that with a tightly folded bandage and leave it until it falls off on its own without harm.
And then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scrofulous sore, then you must close the two edges of the wound and stitch them as soon as there is no more excess fluid.
However, if you see that there is excess fluid due to the size of the sore, it is necessary to cut the root of that sore, and drain it, and administer sutures and what is stated.
And that of the scrofulous sores that contain moisture, pierce it with a superficial incision where you see the area of maturation, and place an incision to drain the pus lower down the body, as we have said.
And then apply poultices, some with ointment and similar to those, so that they corrode what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound is already cleansed, then you treat it with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the boil of the abscess that is in the throat.
The ancients said this incision in the boil, and no one in our land has seen it done.
And this is the writing of the teaching of those people.
However, in those with back pain, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, because it will not be helpful, as all the veins and major blood vessels of the patient are located there.
But in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the disease is not in the lungs, the incision of the boil should be used to avoid the harm caused by burning.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the boil below the three or four circles of the boil, with a small incision along the area between two circles.  The incision should be made in a wedge shape, not through the cartilage, because this area is suitable for incision, as it is free of flesh and the blood vessels are distant.
And if the physician is hesitant, he should then extend the membrane of the throat with a probe, and then slit the membrane until it reaches the channel, but avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
And then, cut the wedge according to what we have described; and the incision of the channel is indicated by the pus that comes out from the broken part and by the cessation of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time has passed in which perforation is feared, bring together the two edges of the wound's membrane, and stitch it together without including the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the procedure we have described, the explanation isn't just about seeing if some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's airway, and the patient has come close to death, and their breathing is cut off, and some people would cut the epiglottis so that the patient breathes above the wound site for some respiration, and be saved from death.
And because of this, I command leaving the wound open until the virulence of the illness is consumed; and its virulence lasts for three days; and then I command closing the wound and treating it until healed.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and put it into their throat and cut a portion of the windpipe, and I was called to treat them, and I found the sound like the sound of the dying, and I discovered the wound and found that the blood which had come out of the wound was little.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming out of the wound, and I treated it until it was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant if she did not have a cough, and after a few days she returned to better health.
And now I say that there is no fear in the treatment of epilepsy.
Chapter XLIV.
Of incision upon an abscess that occurs outside the throat, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and is common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental case is in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty lumps, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the knotting of an artery, and in that case, there is fear (of a worse outcome). And it is not appropriate to apply cauterization with iron except in the case of a small one (abscess). And you should try and investigate this with the probe, and if you find it similar to a fatty lump, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should cut it like the lumps and remove what contains it from the skin and pouch; and if not, then its entire nature must be examined, and subsequently treat the area with the necessary treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of lumps/tumors.
There are many types of lumps, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division.
And it is necessary for me to recount the difference between a lump/tumor and a fistula, in case of doubt.
Thus, I say that with a fistula, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is subsided; and when the putrefaction is complete, the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a lump/tumor, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it resembles that lion's share, which is in the proper pouch/sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a boil and is formed thusly, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two types, either fat and containing moisture, and the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you approach the treatment of a lump/tumor, you should examine and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument called an "intromes," as its form will be described in the chapter that follows this one.
And it is a method of inquiry into abscesses and all lumps, that you take this instrument and insert it into the moistest spot you find in the abscess, and you will revolve your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then, finally, place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the intromes and consider what has come out on its surface.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you incise it superficially with a cut, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture from the instrument's track, then know that it is fatty.
And dry it with a cross-shaped incision, following this shape: In the way that I have taught you, and suspend it with hooks, and carefully scrape the skin away from it on all sides, and if possible, save the skin or bag over it, and remove that pus with the probe.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to remove all that pus, and often this happens, and then you remove it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if any part, little or much, remains, the probe will return according to the most.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders, compress the wound, and apply a warm poultice over that area, and cure it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if it is a large wound, then you stitch the two edges together and cure it with what causes the flesh to grow together.
But if there is a pulsating vein near it, or if it is not pulsating, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed verdigris (which is vitriol) and leave it for two or three days until the wound has calmed and the blood's bubbling has stopped; then return to incising what remains of the wound.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of those, there are three types of instruments, some large, some medium, and some small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, or bronze, with appropriately sharpened ends, so that they penetrate easily into the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called "albereds," and one of them is called a "berid.
And there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large instrument, its shape:
The form of the medium instrument, its shape:
The form of the small instrument, its shape:
It is suitable for those abscesses, fistulas, and buboes, because within them are bones and other things.
And make them round, thick, strong, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of citrus wood, or of horn, or of iron, or of silver.  And the best are when made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which is believed to open fistulas in their cavities, where reflections are present, which are reflected by their lightness through these reflections.
And there are three types, for some are long, others medium, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some are simple, having only one curve, and these are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them are hooks without [a] handle, and these are of three types.
And of those are hooks having two curves, and these are of three types.
And of them are those having three curves, and these are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium-sized hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium-sized hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and they are of three types, for of those there are large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium-sized scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are blunt, and they are not positioned in such a way that the scraping of the nodes is done gently, to avoid accidentally cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be healed and find a little tranquility by the cauterization which is applied to the area around the abscess opening.
And these are the forms of lancets, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and are similar in shape to a ray, with which a cautery is made.
And it has a pointed end, hidden by a sheath, and in it, the parts are running both inside and out, as you wish, just as you see.
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers near the openings of abscesses and are not seen by the patients, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those (things):
The shapes of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is removed, are of three types: large, medium, and small; the shapes of them are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and are thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be available so that through them the flow of blood is removed quickly when needed, and then when it is initially not medicinal.
However, do not use them to remove blood from every part of the body, but only on fleshy areas, such as the parts of the legs and thighs, the arms and breasts, the abdomen and knees, and similar fleshy and moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments like the skins of bladders are made in this shape, by which blood is drawn when done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of male breasts that have grown like those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflamed during puberty, and then the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and become sore and painful.
And for one who sees this, it is necessary to cut those (breasts) with a lunar incision, following this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the swelling, and then fill the wound with a flesh-healing medicine, and then sew the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast inclines downward and is softened by its size, like those of women, then it should be split into two parts, using two similar lunar-shaped incisions, each one being contained within the other at the end of each, so that the larger line encompasses the smaller, according to the shape of lines B and G.  Then scrape away the flesh that is between the two edges of the wound and remove any excess fat.  Then apply the remedies of stitching and powders mentioned previously, which are necessary for healing, until it is cured.
And if you do not complete the incision as necessary because of the patient's distress or bleeding, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until the fat is removed by the corrosive, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the opening of abscesses that arise below the navel.
These abscesses that arise below the navel are of the scrophula type, hard, and contain a pouch-like skin.
And some of these contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a lunar incision, following this figure: from line G to line B.  And when all the pus from the abscess has been evacuated, then you should fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
Then the cotton should be removed and the wound treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes or scrofulas, then you should make an incision on it in the same way as we described in the section on scrofulas.
And if the ulcer has spread to the point of becoming open, then apply a cautery to it, as we previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur from arrow wounds or vein injuries.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the surrounding tissue is inflamed, often an abscess develops.  And the signs by which one recognizes inflammation and abscesses originating from arteries or veins are: for when an abscess is due to an arrow wound, it is often positioned along a limb's course; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you sense a rumbling sound.
And the one caused by a vein injury is round and obvious on the body.
And making an incision into this abscess is a mistake, especially in those under the armpits, in the knees, in the neck, and in many other body locations; and if it is large, its treatment with iron should be avoided.  And those on the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided (i.e., avoided as an incision point).
But for those abscesses that develop from the inflammation of the arrow wound's opening, make a longitudinal incision into the inflamed tissue.  Then, open the incision with hooks, and then the arrow wound, and free it from the surrounding tissues until it is exposed.
Then place a needle on that spot and have it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the arrow wound with a double-threaded thread in two places. — which I show you in the extraction of two arrows, which are in the Templars' hands.
Then pierce the area between the two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood that is in it is expelled, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment where pus is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat that with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the inflamed tissue, and then insert the needle below the area you have held with your hand, and have it penetrate; and use a double thread so that you pull it out from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a strong ligament, as I have shown you in the ligament of the grape vine with two parts and two ends of the thread.
But if you fear pulling out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle beneath the entire abscess, below the initial puncture site, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its central area until what is inside comes out, then you cut away the excess inflamed tissue, and leave what is tied in place.
And then place on it a poultice that has been soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that arises from nerve twisting.
Thus, abscesses arise in the arteries and veins, and similarly abscesses arise in the nerves when they are injured by a blow or excessive work, and by similar causes.
And it is most common in the areas of the tendons or heel, or in any place where the joints are strained.
And it is a serious abscess, and it is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in its most severe forms without pain, and when it is tight with vehemence, the patient feels a kind of numbness.
And it is not an abscess spreading throughout the body, and therefore it remains below the skin, and it is painful on all sides and does not spread to the front or back parts.
Therefore, those abscesses that are in the joints should not be opened with iron, for this would easily lead to contraction.
However, that which is on the head or forehead should be incised with a lancet. But if it is a small abscess, then you should cut it with scissors and remove it by the root.
And if it is large, then you should suspend it with forceps, scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess which occurs from a boil that arises in the belly.
Many men frequently develop boils in their bellies and other parts of their bodies; these boils are called "fungal" due to their resemblance to fungi.  Their roots are subtle, and their heads are large.  Moreover, the edges of these boils are folded over, and they can be small or greatly enlarged.
And I myself have seen one, and in its belly were two boils that resembled fungi even more, and there was no difference between them, being white, with thin roots.
And their edges were inverted and split open, and moisture flowed from it constantly.
Therefore, I incised them and found one to contain eighteen ounces of pus and the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider if the patient is humid, and the boil's color is white, moist, with thin roots; then you should make the incision with a broad spatula, and have cauteries ready in the fire, for frequently much blood is expelled from the incision; and if blood is released, cauterize the area.
And if the patient is weak and fearful, beware of incisions with iron; but then take fresh lead solder and press it against the boil, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease pressing the lead firmly against the boil until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the boil has thick roots, then the incision of it presents some cause for fear and anxiety, especially in one located in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you should incise half of it, and then cauterize the area so it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful that you do not presume to incise a boil which is dark-colored, with little feeling, and of a slow healing nature, for that one is possibly cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer in this case.
Chapter 52.
Of the treatment of a protrusion of the navel.
A protrusion of the navel is caused by many things; either by cracks in the fascia covering the abdomen, and then it is a section of tissue or intestine as in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by trapped wind in the area.
However, if it is due to a rupture in the fascia and a consequent protrusion of tissue, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is painless, and often appears in various locations. And if it is due to the intestine's protrusion, then its location is significantly different from what we have described, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden and then returns; and it is very light there, and it is greatly magnified near the opening of the bath and causes a great deal of struggle.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is painless and does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it believed to be.
And if it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears with a darkening.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, and hard, and it is fixed according to a certain quantity.
But if it is due to windiness, then touching it is painless.
And the treatment in such a case is to consider whether the swelling near the navel is due to blood from an artery or a vein, or windiness; then you should refrain from treating it, for there is fear and dread in that, just as you have been taught in the chapter where I discussed abscesses due to arteries and veins.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to an intestine or a hernia, then you should instruct the patient to hold their breath, and to remain standing; then probe around the entire navel with a probe, and then have the patient lean between your hands on their sides; then circumscribe the area around the navel with a wide spatula at the spot you marked with the probe; and then incise half of the abscess outwardly with a large incision; and then bind around it with strong thread or linen in a proper manner.
And then drain the center of the protruding abscess over the ligament, and insert your finger into that opening and look for the intestine; and if you have found it and secured it with the ligament, then you pull it out gently and push the intestine back into the abdominal cavity.
And if you have found the hernia, then take it with forceps; and cut away the excess tissue.
But if it is contrary to an artery or vein, then circumscribe that area, and then return to your initial treatment; and take two needles and put strong threads in them and insert the two needles into the circumference you have made around the abscess in a cross shape, pushing them in; and then press the abscess into four sections over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the protruding flesh can fall off on its own; or incise it when it is softened and is ready to fall off, and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the protrusion at the navel is of flesh that has grown there or due to humidity, then it is necessary that you drain the abscess as we have said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, and then treat it with the appropriate remedies to consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the different types of cancer and how it is treated with medicines, and that a surgical treatment with iron is to be avoided because it would not be healing; and we have discussed cancer that originates in the breast and the cautionary aspects of its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer can be eradicated in places where it is possible, such as in the nipples or the thigh, and similar areas on the limbs, by removing all the affected tissue, especially when it is small and in its early stages.
But when it is old and severe, one should not attempt to remove it oneself, for I have not been able to cure any such case, nor have I seen anyone else who has been successful in doing so.
And the surgical procedure, when it is located as we have said, is that you should first let the patient rest and purge them of black bile sometimes, and then bleed them if a manifest fullness is found.
Then prepare the patient with the preparations appropriate to the location for surgery, and then insert hooks into the opening that are appropriate to the location; then thoroughly scrape away any tissue with a bone spatula until no trace remains of the roots of the tumor. And allow the blood to flow, do not cut it off lightly, and express the spots, and clean away all the thick blood with your hand or with any instrument you may have.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood, cutting a vein or artery, then cauterize the area until the flow of blood is stopped, and then treat the wound with the other treatments until healed.
Chapter 148.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already described, in the division, the types of water dropsy and the signs of each type, and the treatment of them with medicine.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of "althitas" (a type of dropsy), and it is not appropriate to treat with iron the types of "timpanistes" or "yposarcha," for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanist dropsy with medicine and your treatment does not work, then consider: if the patient is already weakened, or has another illness or other type of dropsy, like in the chest or abdominal cavity and similar to those, then be careful not to treat it with iron, for there is fear of that.
But if you observe the patient with exuberant vigor, and the illness is only dropsy and not a child or an elderly person, then the method of operation is that you lift the patient with your hands, and the assistant presses the patient's abdomen with his hand, pushing the water towards the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a spiny spatula in this way:
It should be two parts, pointed, with a sharp tip like a spatula; however, there should be some slight shortness to it, so that in the operation with it you do not penetrate the intestine and wound it.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for then you must, with the incision, move away from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, on the right side above the abdomen.
But if the dropsy originates from liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the left.
And it is not appropriate for your incision to be on the side on which the patient intends to lie, lest the excess fluids flow to that restrained area.
Then pierce with the instrument all the membrane, and then insert into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the skin, and you scrape that; and if the quantity is of a fingernail or similar.
And then pierce the skin until the spatula reaches the empty space, and it is the place of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles a thin silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on which, at its lower end, is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is cut in the shape of a feather, like this:
And at its highest end is a little ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately clamps onto the instrument, thus evacuating a moderate amount of water, because if you evacuate more than necessary at the time, the patient will quickly die through the resolution of their animal spirit, or approaching death by the violence of the disease.
But evacuate it according to the strength of it and according to the indications given to you by the patient's constitution, the strength of their pulse, and their condition.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water—the reason for this is that it is immediately retained by the cord which covers the hole that is on the part of which I have told you to pierce in this manner.
And then repeat the process on another day, if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small amount of water, and do this for several days with caution, and be careful of mistakes until little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then cure that with burial in hot sand, and inducing sweat in a bath, and waiting in the sun for a long time; and treat that with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize on the stomach, and the spleen and liver after the extraction of the water, as I have described in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children who are born with places where the urethra is not perforated.
Sometimes one of the children is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its penis is not perforated (or it is a very narrow opening, or it is not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with a perforation as soon as it is born with a very thin, sharp instrument using this method:
And then place a thin lead rod in the opening, and tie it, and keep it for three days or for four.
And when he wants to urinate, it is released and he urinates; and then it is returned to its place.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine, which goes onto the area, will not allow this opening to close.
But that part where the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead rod, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But in those cases where the opening is not in its proper place, as mentioned, the cause is one of those who are born with the opening near the end of the penis' head, so that they cannot urinate properly, until the penis is raised with their hand upwards. And it is not a generative condition, because the sperm cannot reach the mother properly, and it is a very prolonged illness.
And the method of the operation in such cases is that the patient is placed on their back, and then you extend the head of their penis with your left hand with forceful pulling, and cut the foreskin from the place of the prepuce with a sharp scalpel, similar to a pen's incision, or that you remove any part, so that the middle of the penis comes to be similar to the head of the penis and the opening falls into its proper place as required.
And be careful, in your surgical procedures, for often bleeding happens; and apply something to stop the bleeding, and heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of the white discoloration that occurs on the foreskin, on the head of the penis, and of the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Often this white discoloration occurs on the penis, and is a swelling of loose flesh.
And of that, one is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant kind, you should suspend it with a fine thread and cut away the affected area until it is all gone; then apply a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment; and following that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the white discoloration is malignant, of a dark colour, then you must apply cautery near the incision and its root.
But if the white discoloration is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and part of the discoloration is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you must remove the discoloration inside first until it is consolidated; and then treat the outside part, for when you treat both at the same time as the foreskin, it is not certain that it will not be torn.
And if you see blackness and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you must excavate all that which is already blackened and about to corrupt or that which is already corrupted; and then apply a liniment on that area, made of honey mixed with ground pomegranate bark and crushed and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
for a beneficial cautery is for two conditions together, that is for a flow of blood and for the plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed at once, then you must insert a lead cannula into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to plague or abscess), you must scrape with an obtuse spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely freed.
And if it is difficult to carefully separate them, then you must scrape with a spatula some part of the penis head and foreskin, because when the foreskin is thin, it is easily pierced by its own thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again.
And then it should be treated with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Concerning the purification of children and the treatment of complications arising from circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds, but as it is our operation and our will, and its use is primarily in children, it is necessary to devise the best and easiest way to ensure their well-being.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not prescribe circumcision in any of their books, for they did not use it in their laws, and it is only through experience that we have come to know it.  The reason for this is that I have found most craftsmen and barbers using circumcision and purification with a scalpel and with forceps; and they use ligatures with thread and incisions with the fingernail.
And I have already tried all these methods and I find no better purification with forceps, with ligatures of thread, than with fingernail purification, for often the wound is more superficial, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, making further incision necessary and causing unnecessary pain. And with the purification performed by means of a rasp, a digital rasp, used by cobblers, the incision of the end of the male member is not secure, because it easily penetrates the opening.
But in the operation with a fingernail, it is very easy to damage the tissue and ruin your work. And a child's foreskin is naturally short, and many times it is born in such a manner that it doesn't need purification, and I have seen that.
However, the purification done with forceps and thread ligatures, its goodness, experience has shown me, because the forceps are for a proportionate incision, because the sharpness on top is similar to the sharpness below; and thus, when you press your hand, both sharpnesses are proportional, and it cuts in a consistent way in an instant; and a compression of the thread is made, encompassing the foreskin of the penis from all sides, with this there's no risk of error at all.
And the first method of the operation is that you should position the child, especially if it is one that understands a little, and you should only tie the thread to its penis and leave it until the next day.
And then do whatever you can to reassure him in every way possible, to accept the situation. And then, keep him still, holding him in your hands properly, and do not be careless; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so the child does not see them or any other instruments.
And then, place your hand on the penis and blow into the foreskin, pulling it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then cleanse it of any dirt or buildup.
The shape of the forceps for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail's root is not severed.  The length of the two cutting edges should be the same as the length of two handles combined.
But the error in cleaning is when you forcefully pull the entire, or part of, the foreskin away from the incision.
Therefore, you should extend it (the foreskin) with your finger before making the incision, and cut it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with forceps and make the incision.
But if three days have passed and that which is inflamed beneath the penis remains after the abscess, then you let it be until the hot abscess subsides, and carefully peel off that area, then incise it as you have prepared.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not benefit him.
And then treat that with what consolidates the wound from the powders that we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if the incision is made too deeply in the tendon, and you cut into the parts above it, that will not be beneficial to him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by blockage created by a stone or congealed blood, or by pus or carrion, and similar to those things we have discussed regarding the methods of treatment in the division [or section].
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and a violent cause is applied to the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction from the patient using an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be of silver and have a slender, concave shape, like a bird's feather pen, with a slender, long reed-like shaft about a palm and a half long, to which a thin tube is attached at its end.
And the manner of drawing the urine with this is to take a doubled linen cloth and tie wool or cotton to one end for a good fastening; and insert the ends of the cloth into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if any excess wool is present, but insert it into the tube with force. Then, lubricate the syringe with butter and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and lubricate their bladder and penis with moist oils, and olive oil and herbs.
Then insert the syringe with ease until it reaches the base of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the pubic area; and then push the syringe into that area; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder, and thus the patient will have reached the empty area.  And this is not done in this order, but rather along the meatus, which has a tortuous path.
And then pull out the cloth with the wool little by little, for the urine will moisten the wool.
Then remove it and use the urine for treatment.  Continue using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Of the quality of bladder flushing with a clamp or similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When the bladder has an ulceration or abscess, or congealed blood within it, or is obstructed with pus, and you wish to distill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form:
but instead, the end of it is closed, sealed. And in it are three holes: two on one side, just like times.  (or "two on one side, twice").
At the beginning is a concave space, in which that which is expelled is contained; and be according to the quantity which obstructs it, without addition, until when any cause is with it drawn from the humors, it is drawn, and when it is expelled, with this is drawn, and when it is expelled far, according to how the clamp is used to put naphtha into naval battles.
Therefore, when you want to introduce liquids into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the liquid, and draw with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, because the liquid is drawn into the cavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp into the penis, as we have recounted in the previous description; and then push the fluid with what you are pushing, because that fluid reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient is cured of that.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is drained, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the topmost head resembles a small feather, and below it a tube within it.
And then take a bladder, and place in it the liquid you want to drain from the bladder, and then tie it between two objects with a strong double-rope bandage, and heat that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the end of the instrument into the penis.
And then press your hand on the bladder containing the liquid with a downward pressure until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and pierce it all the way through; and then insert strong ropes into those holes, as if it were wound; and then attach the circle as if it were attached to a container, so that you put in it what you wish of the liquids, oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and press with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed stones in which the operation is done by hand, and by incision.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly that which is lodged within the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children; and among their symptoms is that the urine passed from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and sand appears within it; and the patient rubs their genitals, and often groans, and is restless; and with this, they often thrust forward their buttocks.
And the cure is easier for children before they reach fourteen years of age; and the cure is difficult in the elderly. But in young people, it is easier because it is among them. (or "among their peers", depending on the nuance intended)
And of those with a larger stone, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to reach a cure for this, it is necessary at the outset to cleanse the patient with a clyster which removes all the inflammation in their bowels; for this inflammation sometimes hinders the expulsion of the stone from the area surrounding it.
And then the patient should be raised with their feet, and be beaten and rubbed downwards so that the stone descends to the bladder, or jumps from its location, or sometimes.
Then make that incision between your hands, and place the patient's hands under their thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to slope towards the lower parts.
And then remove that and all of that outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you should immediately cut into it.
And if it does not completely fall downwards with your touch, then you must anoint your left index finger (if the patient is a child), or your middle finger (if the patient is a full-grown youth), with oil, and insert it into their anus. And remove the stone until it is below your finger. And gently move it little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it away from the place from which you extracted it.
And instruct the attendant to press on the bladder with his hand; and instruct another attendant to, with his right hand, pull the genitals upwards, and with his other hand hold the folds that are below the genitals, at the site of the operation.
And then insert a spatula, which is shaped like this: And cut through the area between the anus and genitals, not in the middle, but slightly to the side of the left thigh; and place the incision over that stone, and have your finger in the anus, and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal one narrow, according to the amount of the stone's protrusion.  Do not make it larger, for pressing your finger in the anus while the stone is near the incision, it will be forcefully expelled without difficulty.
And know that there is some portion of the stone to which the angles and edges adhere, which makes its removal difficult because of this.
And of that part which resembles a gland, and is round,  its removal is easy.
Therefore, if it is the part with the angles and edges that is wedged in the fissure.
And if it is not thus expelled, then it is necessary for you to gently press on it, or to exert pressure on it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and do not move it; or to insert a subtle instrument with a curved tip underneath it.
But if you cannot act on it, then you widen the hole a little, and if you see blood flow, stop it by firmly applying crushed vitriol.
But if the stones are more than one, then at first you push your hand against the opening of the bladder, and then cut into it; and then push a little further in; and similarly do so if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is foolish to cut it with a large incision, for you cause the patient one of two things: either death or a continuing dripping of urine, because the place is not completely healed.
But administer expulsion of it until it is expelled, or work on its fracture with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
So, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and compress it. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and cool water, so that a hot abscess may be quelled.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have loosened that, anoint the area with water and a little oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a hot, burning and corrosive abscess arises, and it resembles that of blood frozen in the bladder, and urination is prevented by it (and this is recognized by blood exiting with the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will provoke putrefaction of the bladder and further corruption.
And then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with any other suitable remedy, using whatever is appropriate for its healing until it is healed.
And during all the healing process, you should bind the thighs together and apply the medicines that have been placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the opening of the penis, and is embedded there, and urination is also prevented, then treat it with what I recommended before to prevent incision, for many times such treatment has been accused of causing incision; and I have experienced this, and it is necessary that you take a sharpened iron drill, of which this is the shape:
of triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take linen, and bind the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, puncturing easily until the drill reaches that stone. And turn the drill with your hand on that small stone little by little, and you enlarge the hole until you cause the other part to penetrate; for then the urine will soon be released.
And then press your hand on that which remains of the stone on the outer part of the penis, for that is fractured and has been expelled with the urine, and the patient is cured.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for any reason which prevents it, then bind a linen cloth below the stone, and another linen cloth above the stone. And then apply a cauterization to the stone on that penis, between the two bandages. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and remove the congealed blood, which has formed in the wound.
And a bandage of linen below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder; the other bandage above is necessary, because when the linen bandage is loosened above the stone's expulsion, the stone returns to its place and heals the wound.
And therefore, when you tie the linen bandage above, it is necessary for you to lift the stone upwards, or it will return to its previous position, and heal the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Concerning the removal of stones in women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
However, if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult and is prohibited by many methods.
One of them is because the woman is very young.
And the second is because you don't find a woman well-informed enough to reveal herself to the doctor when she is chaste, or is a married woman.
The third is that you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation using the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision over a stone in women is distant from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
However, if necessity compels you to do this, then it is necessary that you take a knowledgeable female physician, and few are found.
But if you are deprived of such a person, then seek a skilled and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has considerable expertise in this art.
Therefore, present her, and command her to do everything you tell her, from the examination for the stone at the beginning;  this is to determine if the woman is a virgin, and then it is necessary for her to place her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she must press down on it with her finger, and then command that she make an incision over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, then have her place her left hand on the bladder and compress it gently.
Therefore, if it is found, then it is necessary to gradually pull it out of the bladder opening, downwards with the force of her strength until it reaches the root of the thigh.
And then make an incision over that, in the middle of the vagina towards the root of the thigh, wherever it is lodged, and extract the stone from that area, and the finger should not be removed from the stone while pressing down on it.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; then insert the finger into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then enlarge the incision according to the amount needed to remove the stone from that location.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and sharp and rough, and long and round, and having ridges.
Therefore, you know how many types there are of it, so that you may signify what you wish concerning it.
And if you see blood flowing, apply crushed vitriol to the location and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And ensure you prepare the instruments needed for the extraction of stones in men, so that you are assisted by them in your operation.
And if you see blood flowing, and know that the blood's expulsion is from the incised artery, then you apply powder to the area and constrict it with bandages and a tight dressing, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will die easily. And then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area is healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of the incision for strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sac, which is below the scrotum that contains the testicles, and is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper pouch that nature has prepared in the part of the testicle, until it is seen that there is another testicle; and the scrotum is between the white sac that we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a delay.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that befalls the testicles, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it is caused by a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black, or foul, or watery white, and that is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white sac we mentioned, then the abscess is round, sloping slightly lengthwise like an egg, and the testicle appears, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper pouch, then the abscess is round with a part of the testicle, and therefore one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the root of the testicles and the white sac, then it is felt below (i.e., deeper down).
And if you wish to know the color of the moisture, then you probe the color of the moisture in the abscess with a pointed instrument whose shape is known in advance; and according to what emerges in the trace of the instrument, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary to instruct the patient to be bled, if possible, and to empty the patient's body.
And then lay him on his back on something slightly elevated, and place many cloths under him.
And then sit on the patient's left side, and instruct the assistant to stand on the right side, who should extend his rod to one or both sides of the root of the testicles and the area of the navel.
And then take a broad spatula and split the root of the testicles in the middle lengthwise, almost to the groin.
And the incision should be made along a straight line, equally distant from the line that you would cut the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white fibrous tissue (scrotum) encompassing them.
And scrape that, and observe, and take care that you do not cut it; and your scraping tool, with which you scrape the area, should be suspended by the hook, and delicately examine the scraped area according to the quantity possible for you.
And then pierce the water-filled scrotum with a wide opening, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two edges of the incision with forceps, and spread the scrotum apart; and do not touch the root of the testicles, and cut the scrotum in that way that is possible for you. And cut it (the scrotum) either entirely or in pieces, and especially its thin layers, because if you do not meticulously scrutinize the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the testicle protrudes from its sheath during your procedure, then when you have completed the scrotum incision, return it inside, and then stitch the two edges of the root of the testicles together, and then treat it like other wounds until healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another ailment, then you must tie the vessels that are on the supporting structure, and remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
However, if the fluid is gathered in two distinct areas, understand that there are two hernias; therefore, make an incision in that area as you did in the other swelling; and if it seems to you to be a single operation, then you should do it as one.
And then cleanse the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or in rosined oil; and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over the two testicles and the area of the abdomen; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and tie them on top with a bandage that is in this form:
And then take two cloths and fill them with wadded wool according to this pattern; and have their extremities bound with cotton or damp wool, and they are attached with a tight bandage to the braguier of the breeches, and one extremity goes from the anus up to the groin, and the second goes to the area of the crotch, and two extremities over the thighs below and two others over the knees, and the entire bandage should be adjusted to the braguier of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin knife cautery and that you cut with it the skin of the genitals, and it is heated as we have recounted until the white pouch containing the fluid is exposed, and then you take a cautery in this form: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce that pouch, and heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then extend the pouch with hooks, and scrape it with hooks, and scrape it with a heated, thin cautery; and cut it as much as possible until you have eradicated everything; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
And know that this operation is safer and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with an incision.
But if you encounter a suppurating abscess during the incision or cautery, or a blood flow, then it is necessary to treat whatever problem arises from this with the treatment that suits it, as said.
But if the patient is weak and does not endure the second operation because of its horror, then administer the piercing as I recommend; and it is when you are certain, from what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is acute.
Then it is necessary for you to have the patient sit on a raised surface, then pierce the abscess in the lowest part of it with a wide blade, and place the puncture along the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide until all the water runs out.
And then place a cloth over the area, bind it, and leave it, so that the remaining water drains out. And then treat that until the wound is healed.
But if there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at that time, you pierce that: and this is not done except because the white membrane in the opening of the wound causes obstruction and prevents the water from leaving, then you must place in the wound a device or instrument with which water is extracted from hydrops, the shape of which is described earlier; or apply a small poultice to the wound's pressure.
And know that the water returns, and is collected again approximately six months or thereabouts; and when it is collected, then it should be pierced again in the same manner, so that the patient may pass through their days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia, there is a fear of causing harm in the majority of cases;  therefore, I have witnessed its release and subsequent recovery as a better outcome.
And I remember the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the parts where the humours are congested, and this is caused by various things: either by a sharp, acrid excess which is discharged into the tissues, or by a blow.
And the colour of the abscess is according to the colour of the body part, and if there is no pain found within it, then it is a serious abscess.
And a particularly bad abscess is a calcified one, whose colour is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by the blockage of the arteries, and by the inflammation of those, just as it is already perceived in the memory of it, or by the inflammation of the veins.
However, that which is due to inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when you press on it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein does not disperse from it by any means when pressed with your fingers.
And it is possible that, on this type, a section be made and on the other flesh; and it is that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then stretch the testicle upwards, and extract that from the white tunic, and free the suspensory ligaments, and tie them, and incise the suspensory ligaments more than you have freed that part from all parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already bound up with those tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and cut it.
And if there is an adhesion to any part of the tunic, or between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion that is behind, then it is necessary that you cut everything that is there, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
So, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in warmed oil and wine; and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of a hernia (or rupture) that is of the groin.
The groin is an abscess enclosed by some swelling similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, fear is important because of what precedes it (or, because of the preceding memory/consideration).
However, it is necessary to describe the operation in the order in which it should be performed.
And I say that you must make the patient sit upon a raised stool; then pull down the suspensory ligaments of the testicles; then grasp the scrotum with your fingers and the tissues around the penis; and let another assistant do the same, and pull them with forceful extension.
Then, with a sharp, pointed scalpel, make a transverse incision along the side of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then, scrape away any part in the same way as we have described in the extraction of arrows that are lodged in the temples.
Then, insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it in the first of the places where you have encountered the vein, and tie it again at the back of it. Then, cut them [the affected areas] open in the middle, in a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove whatever is accumulated of the foul and corrupted humors.
Then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds where you want pus to be generated, so that the vessels that nourish one of the two genitals are affected, for it is not harmful.
However, if you encounter veins in all of the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles are tied off along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be hardened, or tied off so that they are no longer useful.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that extends onto the abdomen's surface from the groin area of the lower abdomen, causing the intestines from that rupture to slip into another part of the intestines.
And this rupture is either from the groin or from a stretching of the area, and these two types occur due to various causes: either a blow, or a jump, or a sudden effort, or the lifting of something heavy, or similar things.
The sign of this, when it is due to a stretching of the groin, is that it occurs gradually over a long period, and not suddenly; and it is a gradual swelling towards the groin because the groin compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a tear in the groin, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and it is a diverse swelling visible below the groin area, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and the body of the intestine to the parts outside the groin.
And sometimes, the intestine is accompanied by the membrane and is called this a 'circumscribed intestinal hernia'.
And sometimes it is caused by gas, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is trapped there, and this is a great detriment to the patient; and sometimes it causes intense pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this illness with iron there is fear, therefore, the use of iron in that case should be avoided.
And the method of the operation for this is to tell the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity if it is possible to return it, and then place it over his abdomen between your hands, and elevate the patient's legs.
And then separate the cord that joins the testicles, slightly above the testicles, and cut the cord of the testicles completely along its length; and then insert two hooks into the sides of the incision, as necessary to widen the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount possible for you, allows the testicle to be removed.
And then scrape off the skin that is underneath the cord of the testicles, until the hard, white scrotum is exposed on each side.
Then insert your finger into the area that is the testicle, which is between the white scrotum, which is below the testicle's cord, and the scrotum on the other side, and detach any adhesion that is on the back side of the testicle.
Then pull the cord of the testicles outward with your hand, and with this, lift the white scrotum upwards with your left hand, and raise the testicle with the scrotum to the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle up, and you dissolve the adhesion behind it with proper solution.
And check with your fingers that there is no cause for the intestine to be wrapped inside the hard white scrotum. However, if you find any such cause, then you push it back into the abdomen below.
Then cut into the area below the testicles' cord, making an incision through which blood and pus flow, as we have described in what we have already said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the bandage we have described (and sometimes the white scrotum is cauterized, which we said to stop the flow of blood after the incision, for often this happens). Leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the wound's healing is delayed, then hot water should be applied, and kept on it until it falls off, as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of the windy hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that has been scorched by treatment with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done in this way as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the section over it with ease, and then dry the middle area around the abscess with what opens it, until the vessels fall.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the dislocation that occurs in the ankles.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the ankles, as we have said, and you should remove the displaced part.
And do not leave any cause of intestines in the groin; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all times.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is created in the groin until the intestine descends into the groin; and this happens because of the extension of the groin, which is in the ankles as we have said, which causes the groin to be stretched, and then softened, and the area is suppurated and removed.
And the treatment for it is with cautery, as previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron according to this method: the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then the area of the rupture of the abscesses is dried with a cut across the width according to the amount of three days.
And then tighten the white groin that is under the groin until it is uncovered.
And then take the reed and place it on the prominent area of the groin, and press it against the belly button.
And then sew the two prominent places on the reed/groin's extremity, and join one of them to the other with stitches.
And then remove the reed/groin extremity, and do not cut the groin entirely, nor extend the testicle, nor any other thing thus as I have made you aware in the healing of an intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment of ulcers, and as you cauterize the fils, cleanse it and restore the ulcer until it is consolidated; for the groin is contracted and the rupture's prominence has not been adjusted.
Cauterization is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of softening the swelling of the testicles.
Often the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the tissues around it are softened, and care is given to it.
Therefore, it is necessary for whoever is charged with the cure to lay the patient on their side, and to spread all the softened tissue over the natural tissue; then to stitch the two edges together with sutures.
And if you wish, sew the excess softened tissue at the beginning with three or four stitches, and with firm sutures.
And then you cut between the sutures; and then treat for the healing of other sores until it is healed and the pus has drained.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, yet it is permitted to me to mention it in this book; and its mention is only necessary in two ways. One is so that, when a physician is questioned about it, he may know how to treat the affected person. The other is that we often need to castrate other animals for our benefit, like oxen, goats, pigs, and similar beasts.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion or by incision and section.
But in the method done by abrasion, the process is to immerse the beast in hot water until its genitals are softened, relaxed, and hanging. And then grasp them with your hand until they are resolved and no longer appear beneath the touch.
However, in castration performed by incision and section, you must hold the beast and press the scrotum with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and make an incision on each testicle until both testicles are separated.
And then cut them further, once each is skinned. And do not leave any cause on them except the subtle film that is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better which is done by attrition, for strong attrition leaves no cause in the testicles for the beast to desire intercourse.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men comes in two ways: one is when something appears in the space in the scrotum, between the testicles, shaped like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs.
And sometimes from that area urine flows, which is in the scrotum.
But in women, it's one type: the vulva of the woman on the pubis is like two testicles of a man, a bit smaller and protruding outwardly, like the foreskin of a man, and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: for two types in men and one type in women. And it is necessary that you cut the adhering flesh until the infection is gone, and then you treat it with the cure of other wounds.
And in the second type of men, in which urine is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of the swelling and protruding flesh, due to causes affecting women.
A mild swelling is caused by natural reasons until it becomes compressed and slightly visible; and sometimes, it grows substantially in some women, spreading as widely as in men, and even impeding intercourse.
Then you should remove the excess swelling with your hand or with forceps.
And do not use incisions, especially near the root of the hair, lest you cause a flow of blood.
And then treat it with the same treatment as sores until it is healed.
But flesh born within is flesh that grows within the mother's womb until it fills it, and a mild swelling emerges at the edges, resembling a tail (and therefore some early writers called this "tailed disease").  So we must treat it as we treat swelling, and cure it until healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of a certain illness.
A certain illness is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that has preceded it, and that illness is caused either by poorly fitting flesh, or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it is located either in the mother's womb, or in her ribs, or in the upper part of her body, or in the lower part, and prohibits coitus, impregnation, and childbirth, and strongly prohibits menstruation.
And the knowledge of this is determined by the examination of the midwife, if the blockage is apparent, immediately; but if it is not apparent, then you seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the blockage is due to a thin membrane, and it is near the two lips, then you should cut and break it apart.
And you should place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers from both hands on top.
And the woman should lie on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully spread the two lips until that thin membrane is broken and the blockage is open.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let the patient rest with a man by their side all day so that the incised area does not become solidified.
But if the membrane is thick and large, then you should cut it with a wide bladed knife or a myrtle leaf.
But if the blockage is due to flesh, then suspend that with hooks, and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing bites, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and osier, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And hold it for several days and administer lukewarm water.
And then let it be treated with another healing treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes the disease affects surrounding tissues, and then it is necessary to make incisions in this manner. But if this is due to a cranial abscess, no iron should be used against the cranial abscess in any way.
Chapter 73.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of tail and red swelling that occurs in the female's vagina.
Hemorrhoids are a collection of many veins, from which a continuous flow of blood occurs; and when these hemorrhoids have become old and are painful.
And I have already discussed the types of those and the symptoms of them, and will now state those that receive a cure and those that do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and painful ones, when they are deep inside and do not appear on the surface, then in those no cure should be made with iron.
But those which are on the surface, where feeling is possible, are those which can be cured.
And you should place the woman in a cool place, then carefully cut away the inflamed area with scissors, or a rough cloth, and cut them away from the roots.
Then sprinkle over them a powder which stops bleeding, from among the incisive powders without biting, like acacia and similar ones.
And then you should soak her feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumat [possibly a type of plant], and the bark of pomegranates and walnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a poultice with this and place it on the back of him/her.
And if the blood has stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two leeches, to the nipples without incision.
Then take wool and soak it in the juice of coriander or the juice of arnagloza or the juice of rue with diluted wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a hard swelling in the breast.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the breast, such as cancer, stony abscess, ulcers, boils, and eruptions, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and sores, and other abscesses. And I have already described these diseases and their varieties, their symptoms, and their treatments in the division.
And it is necessary for me to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the breast when it collects pus, and if you wish to know how the operation with iron is performed.
Then you should consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with percussion, phlegm, and fever, and if it sometimes reddens, and if touching it creates a sensation, then do not proceed with a perforation, and treat it with what helps maturation until the sharpness of the symptoms ceases.
And then you should have the woman lie on a bed with two supports; and lean her back on them, and position her feet at the lowest part of the abdomen, and her thighs spread, and place her arms under her elbows, and bind each limb with suitable bandages.
And then the midwife, positioned on the right side, will administer the instrument with which the opening in the breast is made, the form of which will be evident in the actions to be taken thereafter.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you should use its tip to insert it into the nipple of the woman's breast, and that part of the instrument which enters the breast should be no more than the nipple, and ease the patient's suffering. But if the instrument is larger than the nipple, then you should place powders on the texture of the nipple, so that the insertion of any instrument into the nipple is prevented.
And you should place the fluid (or, possibly, the lubricant) that is contained within the instrument on the upper side and have the person administering it hold the instrument, and rotate the fluid until the nipple opening is made.
And when the discharge appears, and is touched with the hand and is wet and sticky, then you should dry that area around the head with a linen cloth.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then you should place a cloth soaked in rubbed or green oil, in which there is some astringency, on the wound, and place the compress on the section near the nipple.
And place externally over the nipple and surrounding area a clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And approximately two days later, apply the appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes the nipple and the wound are washed with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long-leafed aristolochia has been boiled, and then return to using the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the nipple, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, instead treating it with what we described in the section.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living embryos when they are not developing naturally.
It is necessary for the midwife to understand the natural process of childbirth from its signs.  When you see the woman straining downwards and desiring fresh air, and when she is relieved by the pressure of the birth, and hastens the delivery of the embryo, then know that this birth is in accordance with nature.  The delivery of the child will be on its head, and the afterbirth (placenta) will be suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, the woman's abdomen should be compressed so that the embryo descends easily.  For when it descends on its head, it leaves behind the placenta, which is cleaned of excess material through proper cleansing.
However, when the birth is different from this, it is unnatural and undesirable.  For when the embryo emerges on its feet, its body emerging before its head and feet, or one hand or foot emerging, or its head and hand, or its belly protruding, and its head turned sharply away, or its posture different from these natural shapes, then it is considered unnatural.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and astute in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these things, and the ingenuity within them so that they can be understood and observed.
When the fetus emerges on its head through natural expulsion, and the process is difficult for the woman, and the woman's strength is weakened, then perform this treatment:  Let the women hold it, and evaporate its membranes with collected fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife should gently insert her fingers into the small gap and fissure, and with that, detach the afterbirth, or scrape away the moisture within it. And press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary to treat the woman with a poultice of ptilium and a poultice of fenugreek with cumin.
Then command the patient, have them cough, and induce them to sneeze with incantations; hold their mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled soon.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then it is necessary that you return them gently, little by little. But if you do not succeed in bringing it back inside, then place the woman on a stool and raise her feet up, and then lower the stool to the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the commotion.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the fetus dies, then cut them open and remove the remains of the fetus or tie its body to the woman's hand with a cloth and remove it equally, for that will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must push them upward, and then turn the fetus gently, and then swallow it, and then take one of its feet and extend it gently.
But when it has emerged into the thighs, then you command it to strain, and make it sneeze with a medicine, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you gently return the fetus to its natural position, for then it will be expelled easily.
And if it is still not expelled by all that we have described, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, pound them well in a mortar, and then apply this mixture to the vaginal opening, to the lower part of her abdomen. And then apply a compress in lukewarm water, until the hypochondria (the lower ribs) are relieved.
And when the parts below him are calmed, then give him a fumigation of myrtle and apply it to him. And when the fumigation has been applied for an hour, then place him on a pillow, and make him cough and restrain his mouth, and remove the fumigation and gently compress the lower part of his abdomen, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
The fetus emerges lengthwise, hanging from one of its hands. Be ingenious in reducing the hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then elevate the woman and make her walk.
And if walking is not possible, then have her lie down on the bed, and forcefully compress her thighs, and then administer compresses which I have recommended of mucilaginous substances.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, and then study the reduction of the hand, and draw the fetus in a natural way, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
The fetus emerges on the mother's abdomen, its hands and face are on the other side of its mother. The midwife should hold the child's hand and gently and gradually turn it, facilitating its movement.
And when it is drawn out, then apply to its head what we have recommended of oil and mucilaginous substances.
And then command her to move slightly, and when you have done this, have her sit on a stool and command her to lean to her right side, and then command her to strain; and make her sneeze with the appropriate conditions. The prepared fetus is placed on its side.
When the mother is delivered of the afterbirth in this manner, consider, and then you cut the placenta with your fingernail until the moisture is expelled.
And if the fetus is suspended on its face and neck, then you cut it at the umbilical cord, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus into the parts within until you place it as is proper, and tell the woman to strain herself several times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and soon dies; but some are born contrary to nature, and do not live.
And count them, whether they are multiple, a second one, and separate them by cutting the ligaments at the umbilical cord of each.  And sometimes they are expelled as easily as a single fetus, in a natural way, and sometimes in an unnatural way, as we have described.
And if some of them are difficult during delivery, and reach the point we've discussed concerning unnatural forms, then treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is clever enough to adapt to each unique situation to bring about recovery.
A recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and those that are aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  I have verified that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all fully formed.  This was determined by the measurement of the learned sages.
And all this must be within the midwife's knowledge, for it is easy to misinterpret such subtle appearances, and therefore one must proceed with caution.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus using the methods we have discussed in the division of medicine, and it has not emerged naturally, and you are forced to use manual extraction, then you must consider if the woman is of healthy constitution and not suffering from any of the conditions that might cause her to be in danger.
Then the woman must be positioned on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her thighs elevated.
And the attendant should hold her (the woman) on both sides or bind her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with soothing oils and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the location where she can hook her fingers onto the fetus.
And suitable locations for this: then consider if the fetus is positioned so that its head is presenting, and then you hook your fingers into its neck, or the head, or the mouth, or the palate, or under the chin, or in its armpits, or in the appropriate areas of the ribs, or under the flanks (hypocondria).
But if the presentation is on its feet, then in the groin, or in the middle of the ribs.
And it is necessary that the fingers of the right hand grasp the curve of the fetus in the area between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and place the fingers in one of those locations we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space (meaning the birth canal).
And then place another finger, or a third if necessary, in contact with it, so that there is a pulling action, and not an extension according to its natural state alone.
And be moved in every direction, so that its exit is eased, as is done when a tooth is removed.
And it is necessary for the part between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary for the midwife to anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert those fingers and gently manipulate what is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the fingers should be moved to a higher location; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if the hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to return it by applying pressure, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is entirely expelled, and cut it either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.
And thus it is necessary that you do the same for the other hand and the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or if pressure is applied to it during delivery, or if water is collected around the head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the bony parts, and break the head open and remove the water, or to pierce it with an instrument called an "alundat" (the form of which will be found with the forms of other instruments in the chapter near this one).
And similarly, do this if the fetus has a large head naturally; and then it is necessary to pierce it with an algematu, or to take it with an alunda as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has emerged and is pressed against the pubic bone, then it should be incised until the moisture contained within the feet is expelled.
But if it is not complicated, nor resists delivery, then you incise the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is swollen or hydrops, then you must pierce it until the moisture within it drains out.
But if the fetus is positioned on its feet, then the traction on it should be gentle, and the direction towards the mother's mouth should be gentle.
But if it is pressed against the abdomen and feet, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and you must cut the abdomen and feet until what is inside them flows out.
But if the other limbs are out and the head is turned, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the air space, and search for the head with it, and pull it with the fingers toward the mother's mouth, and then insert a single or two fingers, and pull it with those.
And if the mother's mouth is blocked by a hot abscess that has occurred on it, then it should not be disturbed.  Instead, a poultice of fatty, moist substances should be applied. And apply poultices; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisturize.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned; and what we have described for a living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary to not leave any cause within the afterbirth.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of abscesses that occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then place it in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb a fetus was dead, and soon after that fire another time pregnant, and soon after that fire a dead fetus was again formed. A long time ago, an abscess occurred on his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and medicated him for a long time, and the wound was not healed.
Then I applied some strongly-attracting plasters to him, and one bone came out, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised, since there are no bones inside the belly.
And then I concluded that they were bones of the dead fetus.
Then I treated the wound, and removed many bones from him, the woman being in her usual condition, and she lived in that manner for a long time, recovering from the pus.
And I did not consider this strange, for in this there is knowledge and help for what the skilled physician administers with their hands to heal.
Of the forms of instruments necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of vertigo with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of constriction in which the books are bound, with two twists at the two ends of two strings. However, this twist should be finer than the constricting one, and should be made either of silk or of wood.
And the width of each string should be two fingers and the margin of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle place of the two strings are two joins of the same string, which are already fastened, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mother's mouth so that it may be opened with these when you rotate the two prescribed twists.
Another form similar to this, but finer and lighter:
Let it be made of silk or wood, resembling forceps. However, at its extremity are two additions, just like before, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the mother with these, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging down, opening the area between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with forceps, according to the amount you want to open the opening of the mother until the midwife does what is desired.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
A form of pushing by which the fetus is pushed:
A method of assistance by which the large head is contained.
And it is similar to forceps, with teeth at the end, as is sometimes the case.  And sometimes it is made long, like forceps, in this form,  similar to what happens, with teeth like saw teeth with which it is incised and contained. A method of assistance that is less involved/less difficult.
A method of grasping using a spine/spike.
A method of grasping using two spines/spikes.
A form of spatula with two ends, with which the head is severed/cut off.
Form of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments are used, and the more the kinds of those instruments are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the lighter their operation is and the more valuable to men for their quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, wherever they are or may be available to you, for the necessity of those is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth/placenta.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should tell the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a stimulant, and firmly press your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a bowl, pierce a hole in its cover, and place in it herbs opening the mother's mouth, such as wormwood, rue, fennel, chamomile, arabic gum, cassia wood, and holy thistle. All these herbs, or some of them, should be immersed in water in the bowl, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed tube in the mother's mouth, and hold it in place until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it hasn't been expelled, then you order the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or in marshmallow mixture, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it.  And when she has found it, then take it and carefully pull it out slowly.  But if it's attached to the uterine wall, then insert her hand as we described, and when she has found the afterbirth, pull it out slowly, little by little, so that the mother does not suffer from excessive pulling. Beforehand, it is necessary that it be moved easily to the right and left sides.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and herbal remedies.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then be careful not to continue pulling at it, but rather what has emerged from her mouth onto the woman's lap, and then dress it with an ointment and a four-herb medicine; for that will cause it to rot within a few days and dissolve, and it will be expelled.
But when it rots, there is a bad odor rising from the head and stomach, and this afflicts the patient; and then fumigations and appropriate remedies must be administered.
But some of the ancients already used fumigations of juniper and dried figs.
Method of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And the slender end should be placed in the vessel, the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed over the embers of the fire.
And hold it until the fumigation is consumed and repeat another.
For the treatment of an unperforated infant's anus.
Many infants are born with their anuses not perforated, which are then very narrow and obstructed. Then the midwife should perforate that narrowness with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the sphincter muscle.
And then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the infant wishes to suckle.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a plague or abscess; then that consolidation must be incised, and then treated with what we have mentioned regarding healing and lead.
Of the treatment of fistulas that develop afterward.
The fistulas that develop in the lower part, pus-filled and swollen, which develop near the anus externally or in the space of that part.
And it is a fistula or abscesses.
And when that swelling is old and comes from watery white moisture or subtle decay, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known by the fact that things come out of them through discharge and by windiness; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and worms are frequently expelled from them.
And sometimes those fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some of those penetrating ones go into the joint of the thigh and into the bone marrow of the thigh.
And how a penetrating fistula is known from a non-penetrating one in the rectum is that you place your index finger into the rectum, and gently insert a thin probe of bronze or iron into the fistula, when there is no twisting.
But if there is twisting in that place, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel any of that, nor does any discharge, worm, or windiness proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then work towards a cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the urethra, then the sign of that is incontinence of urine and the prohibition of it until the area is consolidated with medicine.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone, and pain in the surrounding area, then the sign of that is that the probe goes in straight if there is no twisting into the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that it will always be painful; and that no medication will work there, nor will it be healed with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the cure for those is the work and vanity of the experienced physicians, on which one must rely.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected, as I have told you, and this I have already tested/tried.
And it is that the patient lie between your hands on their back, raise their legs up, their thighs bent towards their belly, and then insert a lead probe, or a ram's horn if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe goes straight.
And if that touches the patient around the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe itself penetrating through your finger, or something else between your finger and that tissue or flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
But nevertheless, some might say that it is cured in some men slowly.
And the treatment through which improvement is expected in him is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those flesh tissues that are connected and fistula-shaped, like a bird's feather quill, are burned.
And then treat it with some bandages until all the burned flesh has healed, and then treat it with medicinal ointments that cause the flesh to grow and heal, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it is not curable at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate your finger inside the anus, and between that and the probe is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula extends into that area which touches the surface of the skin, then cut the skin at the beginning of the fistula, and you cut it with the probe, and keep it inside the fistula until the cut reaches the point where the probe's tip arrives; and through the probe it is freed and extracted.
And then cleanse those fistula-shaped tissues which are connected like a bird's feather quill, and leave no cause of them behind.
But if blood flow comes between you and your operation when you are burning those tissues, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire has two good habits: it burns those attached tissues, and it removes blood and excess moisture.
And then treat it with bandages or strips of cloth until the wound heals, and then treat the wound with ointments that cause hard flesh to grow and heal.
And these are the medicines that involve astringency and excision; when this is done, it is already healed and you need not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula has already pierced the anus and is extended from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
And therefore, if you feel a resistance and there is a layer of hard tissue or flesh between you and it, and it is close to the penetration, then there is no operation on it but rather a way of trust and hope.
This condition can be treated in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or excise it until you reach its cavity, so that it is possible for you to insert remedies and proper treatment; and do not proceed much with excision, so that you do not cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that it happens to the patient in the way of a spontaneous expulsion; and then treat it with what we have said, for it will be easily healed; or extend the membrane and clean the pus that you cut close to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp tip, and then clean those fistulous flesh which are in the incision, until you can close it with a scab; and then strive to complete the healing of the entire wound by excision; and if the opening above is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the area of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the fold of the anus around the body's surface with its edge and at the margin of the anus, then use a probe with a pointed tip, which is like a needle for preparing the skin in this manner:
and insert into that a probe wrapped with five threads or around those; and then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches the cavity.
But if it is penetrating into the margin of the anus close to the inside, then you remove the thread from that hole in the same way you put your finger into the anus; and you pull out the thread's end and bring the two ends together, tie each one, and leave it for a day or two.  And when you cut the thread into the flesh, hold it tightly until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
However, if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever manner you have prepared, but not too deeply, because it is not your job to do so lest you injure the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the probe with which the fistula is probed: one curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows into the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are between the buttocks, similar to bunches of grapes, or they are like the grapes of a bunch. And of those there are small and large, and whether the blood flows from them constantly or is one, or many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those outside the anus are according to the measure of little humidity, from which flows yellow water or a little blood with a continuous consistency, and they are according to the color of the matter.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is that you order the patient to sit down and to press until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear before you. Then you grasp and suspend them with tweezers or hold them with your fingernail, and then cut them near their roots.
But if the tweezers are not holding them due to their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or wool pad, and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them and sprinkle some warm powders onto their incision so that they stay in place instead of using a cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not open, then prick the patient with a prickle containing a small bite, and wash it with whatever is in the anus to gently open it when the patient is pressed.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your fingernail or tweezers, cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And for the incision you've made, you should apply a suture like this: take a thread wrapped around it and insert it into a needle. Then, pull the hemorrhoids apart and use the needle to pierce the base of the opposite side, wrapping the two ends of the thread around the area below the needle, in a transverse manner.  Tightly compress the hemorrhoid, then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this to all of them, and leave one unsewn so that the excess blood can drain from that one.
And then place a cloth soaked in warmed oil or a plaster over the anus, and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointments or another treatment until it is healed.
And if they are old and the previous medicine is not working, then you should scrape them with the tip of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are soft and the skin pus above them is removed, which prevents healing; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first until much blood comes and they are scraped; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that "alamermar" (likely a specific type of skin condition), that is, a key point, is a reddish round spot, like a nail head, that appears throughout the body, especially under the feet and on the fingers, and it often signifies inflammation.
And then it is necessary to cut what is around the spot, and it should be held with forceps or tweezers and pulled out by its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described earlier in its chapter.
However, a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round elevation on the body's surface, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to cut or scrape it with a knife or with a file until it closes. And if you wish, cauterize this, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
However, a pimple is a small, scabbed or pus-filled, large elevation on the surface of the body, often found on the groin, and when the cold encounters it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt, and it appears around the body.
And the treatment is to take a hollow tube made from an eagle's or hawk's feather, a strong one, and place it over the pimple until it surrounds the pimple's circumference with the tube; then, turn your hand with the tube until you have scraped what's within the pimple's circle, and place it in the groin of the flesh, so that the pimple is eradicated from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron, following this method:
The part above the tube should be thin, closed (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the grip on it is smoothed and its rotation facilitated.
And if you wish, cauterize the pimple according to what has been previously described in the chapter on cauterization of boils.
Of the forms of instruments that are used to give treatment.
Sometimes treatment is done with silver or brass or bronze melted or hammered; and sometimes it is done with those small and large instruments, depending on those to which they are applied, for that which is used in the treatment of small children should be small; and of those whose legs are swollen or painful, the treatments for those should be small.
The form of large and small treatment:
The head of the cannula above it, to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a clear distinction where the bag is tied, just as it is usually done.
And the lower end of it, which is inserted into the buttocks, should be closed (that is, not open) very tightly, approaching thinness; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the holes should be according to the thickness of the rays, and the largest one slightly smaller.
And the bag, in which the bladder medicines or sheepskin are placed, should be one palm in width.
And it should be perforated with many holes, just as it is folded; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, hot blood, which should be from ten bloods, or about that; and attach the bag with that.  And when the bag is placed on him, tie it tightly at the head of the bandage between two distinctions, with strong constriction, and then bandage each hole with that.  However, the quality of bandaging with that is that you fill the bag with medicine, which should be warmed to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs up, and place a cloth underneath them, such as linen or a sheet; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then insert it into the buttock with ease, and then the attendant takes the bag and squeezes it with both hands and forcefully until everything within the bandage is expelled into the bowel; and then remove the bandage, and the patient lowers their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine causes such expulsion, keep it in place for as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it for a whole night, it is more beneficial in recovery.
But if you use the bandage for ailments of loose bowels and to prevent expulsion, then you repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or abscesses in the buttocks, then the bandage should be very thin and delicate, like the bandages used for children.
Concerning the treatment of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of plagues what was appropriate to the book, and I say thus the treatment of them with hands and with medicines according to the requirement.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diverse depending on how the plagues are caused and on the location where the plagues appear.
And the causes why plagues are often caused are like a stone thrown, or a cut with a blade or knife, or a blow with a spear, or a stick, or an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the plagues that are in the parts of the body are like a plague that falls on the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues so that you can apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the remembrance of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from a thrown stone or similar, and the skull has only been slightly fractured, and it is a large wound and you fear the onset of a festering boil in the patient, then you should quickly bleed the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw from it the amount of blood appropriate to the patient's strength, unless some reason prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is meager.
And let the bloodletting be on the opposite side of the afflicted part; and guard the patient from repletion and from rich foods and drinks.
But if any cause prohibits bloodletting, then reduce the patient's food intake and do not allow them to eat meat or drink strong wine.
And if a festering boil occurs on the wound, apply a poultice of roasted olive oil or wine that has been made astringent.
But if a festering boil is certain, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and the air hasn't changed the powder I will shortly describe.
And if the air has already changed that (i.e., if it's no longer recent), then apply various ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from a cut or similar injury, and its edges are not properly aligned by themselves, then draw those edges together with stitches according to my description of suturing them.
However, if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendons, and it's not a significant injury but a slight separation, then cut it open and subsequently treat the wound with medicines, and bring the flesh back together in the manner of a splint, and order the patient to consume foods that are rich in substance, such as heads of cabbage, legumes, and the like, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the splint and it's not adhering to the bone, then you cut away all the putrefied material and discard it, and subsequently treat the area.
However, if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood may flow, and it has not been severed by medicine, then you must look for the artery.  And if you find it uncut, then you cut it with a scalpel, or tie it off; and if the situation demands that the methods previously described are not sufficient, then you cauterize it until the blood flow is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause of them is slight; therefore, you should sprinkle this powder on them, for it will solidify them before the air alters them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched lime; all must be finely ground and sifted.  Then fill the wound with it and bind it tightly until it adheres well to the area and is coagulated with the blood.
And then you bind it on top with bandages and leave it, and do not loosen it until it has become suppurated, because the medicine is not eradicated from there until it is healed.
And sometimes this alone is enough, when you don't have frankincense and dragon's blood readily available.
And you perform this same operation on large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it and bind them, especially on recent wounds with their own blood, which the air has not yet altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then this powder is not suitable for application. Instead, treat them as we have described,  or put on some digestive ointments or dust on the wounds flour from barley mixed with water and honey until it forms a paste.  Then treat them with other methods until they are healed.
But if a small bone fracture occurs in the wound, then you remove that with care.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of wounds of the neck.
But if a wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment between a simple wound of the neck and a simple wound of the head.
However, if the nerve or artery of the neck is cut, then if it's a nerve, there is no remedy, but rather avoid treatment with anything that causes strong astringency, such as zinc or verdigris (copper sulfate) and similar substances, for they damage the nerves and worsen the situation. And do not apply any cold substance to the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if this is treated with mild remedies, such as washing it with fresh water, sometimes infused in olive oil (either processed or unprocessed), and turpentine when washed with fresh water, and other similar softening stones, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or stitch up its edges, and then treat it with powders until it heals.
However, if the wound is deep or has reached the underlying hard tissue, then drill through it at the lowest point.
But if an artery is already cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then either separate or tie off that artery, or cauterize it if necessary.
But if the vertebrae of the neck, or the entire neck, have been severed and the veins of the neck are saved, then you should join the edges of the neck wound with sutures along the spinal column, and do not touch that; first straighten it and return it to its natural position, and then bind it with appropriate bandages, and leave it for several days; then treat it with ointments that are astringent and stimulating until it is healed.
But if the wound has already affected the bone significantly, then you must treat it, and if there are bone fragments there, remove all those you can; and what you cannot remove, leave until the wound has become suppurative, and the separation and discharge have lessened.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder, as instructed, on it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what is mentioned in the relevant section of this chapter.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you assess its depth, then consider further if the wound is creating windiness as the patient breathes; then know that the wound is fatal.
And if the wound is not deep and is fresh, with its own blood, then you place powder on the wound in the first hour, but do not press it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but instead place an attractive ointment there, and apply it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available, then you place old wool in the wound opening to absorb the moisture; and have the patient sleep on the wound so that anything there that is stuck to it may be released.
But if three days or more have passed since the injury, and the patient shows no spasms, tremors, or bad heart condition, or constriction of the airways, and the other bodily functions are good, then know that the wound is salvageable; and then treat it with poultices and other remedies until it is healed.
But if healing is impossible, and the wound remains open, then know that a fistula has already formed; treat it therefore according to its specific treatment.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or a sword, and is superficial on the foot or back, then treat it with sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if the wound has already affected the bone, and pieces of it have already been cut out, then you should clean the wound and try to remove those pieces if they are loose. But if they are not loose, then leave them until the wound can heal, as removing them would be painful.
And for other wounds that may occur on other limbs, the treatment is similar to what we have already described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment which occurs in the abdomen is either severe, mild, or moderate.
A small rupture is more difficult to repair in another way, and if the reduction of the affected part isn't done quickly, it becomes more difficult because the opening enlarges and the return of the organ becomes difficult.
Therefore, a moderate rupture is the best, because in that case the reduction of the bowel is not difficult, unlike in the two aforementioned types.
And know that abdominal suturing is done in four ways, but two of these suturing methods are common and appropriate for wounds/suturing in other parts of the body.
Two other suturing methods are unique/appropriate for other injuries, but are particularly appropriate in abdominal suturing.
And I will explain each one to you with explanation and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the bowel has protruded through it, and it is difficult to reduce, then this can be in one of two ways: either due to the small size of the rupture, as we have said, or when the bowel has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, you should warm it by submerging a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in water infused with vinegar, cyperus, and spikenard, and use this to soothe the bowel until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, using this in a way that has astringency is better than plain water for resolving inflammation.
And when you see the inflammation resolved, then you should moisten the bowel with water in which elderflowers and mallows have been boiled, for this will ease its condition with little difficulty.
But if the condition of the protrusion is not eased by this treatment, then you should cut the rupture slightly with an instrument, such as used for hemorrhoids.
And the initial treatment is better when it is successful without needing a cut, and there should be no attempt to cut when it is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
Of the instrument, take note of its shape:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the tip is slender, but not as slender as a spatula, rather slightly blunt.
And if the protrusion is large and the intestine is outside, then its return must be according to its natural shape, to its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then raise their head and feet higher than the lower parts of their body.
And similarly, if the protrusion is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then constantly direct your attention and consideration to this, so that the part where the protrusion is is higher than the other.
And so you must administer this in large and moderate protrusions.
And in small protrusions, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant place their hands underneath, the one holding the protrusion completely with their hand and joining the edges, and then determine if any other cause is needed to aid in the suture.
And this is the common method of suture: take a needle, or several needles, according to the size of the protrusion; then place the tip of the needle at the edge of the protrusion on the ring finger, and thread the needle, making sure you don't place the thread on both ends of the cord, using the two ends of the thread from under the cord of the interior parts, until you make that part penetrate; you have now joined the two ends of the cord and the two ends of the thread, and created four stitches.
And then tighten the double thread around the needle, sometimes from two sides at once, and then close the two edges and the protrusion in a neat closure; then leave the width of the finger and insert another needle, and then tie it with thread as with the first needle; and do not cease to do this if necessary with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the protrusion.
And the needles should be of medium thickness, neither too fine nor too thick, for very thin needles easily pierce the flesh; and thick needles are difficult to insert into the cord, therefore they must be of medium fineness and thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too close to both ends of the cord, so that the flesh is not easily pierced, and the wound breaks open before its healing.
And the sutures should not be too long, so that the wound is not hindered from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient during their sleep; and you shall place on the suture powdered substances spread out on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound has healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles (or thereabouts) suffice in their suture.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you close the four extremities of the cord and two extremities of the  slips (or strap) at once with a needle that is of faithful wrapping (or carefully wrapped), whether it is thin or thick.
And then, when you have pierced these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same point from which you began, so that the thread retracts from the most superior part of the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture, with which the cloths are tightened.
And place between each suture the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture is known (or, and this suture is well known/used by men).
And with such a suture, I closed the wound that had befallen a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was greater than a palm, and the intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle part, and the rupture was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced that, after the intestines had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I healed him and he is healthy; and after that, he lived for many years, and he is remembered for his accomplishments.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be healed; and by a miracle it was, for I did not treat it with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed old cloth over the wound twice a day and bathed it constantly with honey water until he was healed.
But I will tell you two kinds of sutures, proper according to the narration of Paraula.
And it is that you begin with a suture of the cord, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus, as the needle penetrates the cord and in that same laceration, following its direction and length throughout the body, and leaves the end of the thread where you inserted the needle; and push the needle from the inside to the outside of the other end of the thread.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make that penetration again in that same end of the thread, from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this loop, and push the needle into the other end of the thread from the inside to the outside.
And push with that your penetration, with which you make that penetration into the thread at the end of the thread which is on his side until all of it penetrates.
And then, starting from this same side, stitch it with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the cord which it penetrated, and then return it to that cord and stitch the end of the thread which is on the other side with this end of the thread; and remove that from the cord which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once more until you have sewn everything on the outside according to that example.
And the sum of this method of suturing is that you sew with a suture of hides, with which one sews hides, in such a way that you stitch the thread once from the end of the cord, and then leave the other end until you have completed it.
However, the second kind of suture, which you correctly call Gallic, and this is a description of it and its use, is that you sew it according to a similar method as some healers sew it, in such a way that they join every part to its corresponding part on him, as is natural; and they apply the one end of the thread and the end of the thread to the other end of him.  And this is done as I have described to you.
You must insert the needle into the end of the thread close to the outer part, and make it penetrate into the inner part of the wound, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside through the two ends of the thread.
And then turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other ends of the thread, on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the usual, simple suture, and it is the suture of which we have previously spoken.
This is the Gallic method.
And some might say that the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles; this is to say that you insert a thread into each of them, and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who know how to sew the skin equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is the judgment of the other plagues.
Which means that when you catch the plague fresh, with its blood before the air alters it, and return the intestines and sew it up properly, then place the incarnative powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then place upon it some ointments which are present with you until they form a hard stone and the threads fall out, and they are consolidated completely and watched; and then cure it thus as is the cure of other plagues until it is healed.
But if the medicines are not present with you, then place it on it immediately, as soon as it begins to shed pus, old matter, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need other medicine in many situations when the plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague is spreading to the main limbs, then you should soak linen in oil of a tempered quality, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas between the armpits and under the arms.
And if pain or putrefaction is felt in his intestines, for this often happens, then cauterize it with black astringent wine, especially if the pustule has broken through the intestine and created a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called the "jejunum" does not receive healing from a plague that strikes it completely; and this is because of the great multitude of veins in it, and because of its size, and because of the delicacy of its structure, and because of its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if the plague's result is a membrane, and you find it recent, reduce it according to the method by which you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has spread to the surrounding space and is already green or black, then you should apply a strong pressure with a cloth on the location that is blackened by it, so that blood flow will result, for there are veins and arteries in the membrane.
And then, cut through the material next to that ligament, and place the two ends of the cloth hanging below the affected area outside it, so that the pulling away of the affected area from the binding of the membrane and release of the plague's extension is relieved.
A reminder of the plagues when they affect the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, it is possible in some cases for it to be restored.  Because I saw one who had been afflicted in their abdomen with a lance thrust, and the plague was on the right side of the stomach, and the plague was old and had formed a fistula, and expelled gas and flatulence.
Then I considered the healing of him, though I was not confident in his recovery, but I focused on subtly treating it until it was healed and the area was consolidated.
And I, seeing the area already consolidated, observed the patient for any further trouble in their abdomen; and no further illness arose from that accident, and they remained in their usual state, eating and drinking, and subsequently entered a bath and engaged in their usual activities.
And some experienced practitioners have said that when a rupture occurs in the intestines, and it is small, it should be treated in this manner: You should take ants with large heads; and then bring together the two edges of the rupture, and place an ant with its mouth open on the two edges of the rupture; then when it bites those edges and closes its mouth, you should cut off its head, because it adheres and does not dissolve.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease doing this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire rupture.
And then you compress that and close the rupture; and those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.
And it is also possible to bind the intestine with a fine thread, which is made from the intestine of an animal similar to it, once it is threaded onto a needle;  and you should take the end of this thread made of intestine, and it should be very thin, and then tie that end to the thread surrounding it, and then thread that thread onto a needle and bind the intestine with it and return the thread to the opening.
And this method of suturing with ants is only according to a method of trust and hope.
But if the rupture is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, because then there is only subtlety, and not a complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, and forms an ulcer, and is not healed and discharges pus continuously and is not surgically removed, then, wherever in the body it may be, it is universally called a fistula and we call it an ulcer.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, fibrous tumor, without pain, and with a cavity similar to the cavity of a bird's nest; and for this reason, it is called a 'knotted ulcer,' that is, a nest.
And in some people it is moist, which discharges pus; and very easily the moisture is removed in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes large, and sometimes subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their cure with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you aware of the cure for a fistula, which is performed by means of surgery with the hands.
And know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for some are fistulas that penetrate the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the spinal cord, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the spine, or to any of the joints composed in this way, like the hand and foot; and those that are near the main limb and similar ones.
And therefore, those fistulas that are of this type are among the difficult-to-heal illnesses, and they do not receive a cure, and to deal with them is laborious and ignorant.
And if any of the fistulas is not deep enough to reach those places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and you want to learn about it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula is in a straight line, investigate it with it.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is suited and bends towards the winding path.
And if the fistula has many horrors, it is not possible for you to examine it with a probe.
Then irrigate the openings with its openings, for the moisture you irrigate with goes to the other openings and runs through them.
And then carefully inquire, in whatever way possible for you, if there are bones or nerves present, and if the fistula's cavity is distant or near, or if it is a fistula with many openings, and consider all of this with the full force of your knowledge, your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the location of the pain in relation to your pressing your hand on the area, and the signs and causes similar to an abscess.
And when you have considered all of those things with careful judgment, then proceed to the cure according to your understanding: and consider whether the fistula is an obvious, nearby fistula, or in a salty place, far from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places that I have told you about.
Then you should dry the fistula as previously described, and remove what is in that filtration and decaying flesh, and what is growing in the opening of the flesh, or pus and similar things, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the fistula is of a deep, hidden nature, as determined, then it must be incised as deeply as possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh; and then apply medicated dressings, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have cut open with an iron.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine has consumed everything that remains in the fistula's cavity from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you should cauterize it as we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you should explore and dry it as we have described, if you do not find any cause of a vein, nerve, or major limb in the way, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and continues to break out as it did before, then know that you have not achieved complete eradication of the corruption; and then you must uncover it again thoroughly and carefully scrape and cleanse it with the full strength of your tools, and then restore it.
And so, if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that that corruption is in the distant depths of the body, which you have not reached, and therefore, there is no remedy for you but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then you pull it out with delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then carefully extract them all, and leave no trace of them with your strength.
But if any cause of moisture presents a difficulty, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh, if present, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place over the wound whatever can cover that wound, and leave it until it is approximately surrounded by those bones, flesh and ligaments, and watch that the wound does not become consolidated, and the incision you made in your operation is constricted.
However, if you fear, place on it cotton soaked in crushed oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, the removal, and their extraction, is eased.
But if there is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone, or similar to those, and only the surface is corrupted, then scrape that with a rasp just behind until that blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the part of the bone that is corrupted is large, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to close that and to cut it all the way to the point where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is consolidated.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and help in your operation.
There was a young man, about 30 years old, who suffered pain in his thigh.  And the material (or malady) spread from within the body until it reached the thigh, and it was a matter of an abscess with a large abscess.  It was not an external cause.
And then the time was prolonged by the doctors' error, until the abscess opened, and many materials flowed out, and its healing was delayed until the leg became fistula-like, and many openings formed in it that all expelled pus and bodily fluids.
And then a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and none of them had skill in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the materials that flowed from those openings, a great deal; and already the man's body was all wasted, and his complexion was yellowish.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.
And then I probed all the openings and found them extending to various parts of the leg.
And then I probed and incised one of those openings until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it decayed, already brittle and blackened; and a part of the leg was already decayed, having penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sealed what I had uncovered and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I judged that it was not in the bone but that decay which I had cut out and sealed, and I had already drained it.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I again probed and uncovered the bone a second time over the first discovery, and found continuing decay with the bone.
And I sealed what appeared to me of that decay, and then I was forced to make its cure and restoration, and it was not restored.
And then I discovered it again and did not stop cutting the small bone piece by piece, and forced its restoration, but it was not restored until I cut around a palm's width of it, and extracted its marrow, and then restored that with medicines, and it was slightly consolidated and healed.
And no further repetition in the operation or section of it is necessary except for the weakness of it and its little tolerance and fear of death, for it suffered at all hours from a bad fainting due to an excess of evacuation.
And therefore healed entirely, and nothing is in place of bone but hard flesh; and its arrangement within its body is good, and its virtue has returned; and it has been restored to its proper condition, and it caused no hindrance in walking nor harm in any way.
However, if there is a prominent bone in a displaced part of the body, then you should cut it in this way: you should take a bandage and tighten it at the end of that prominent bone, and order someone to extend it upwards; then place a thicker wool bandage over the first one; and then tie that over the flesh beneath the bone, and extend its end so that you pull the flesh down towards the lower parts, and you expose the flesh over the place you wish to cut so that the cut doesn't damage the flesh.
And place a stick or board under the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut is not forbidden from not cutting the corrupted flesh.
And the cutting should be done over the corrupted area little by little, for if the corruption is in the hollow of the bone and does not appear in its surface to the touch, then you should cut it again.
And if the bone is corrupted but not prominent, with one part continuing onto the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then you expose the flesh from all sides; and then place a stick underneath, and then cut that from the first part where the corruption is until the cut continues to the other part.
And the cutting should be done precisely over the area of the corruption, a little at a time, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not a reasoned cause, but something else.
And if the corruption is in the flesh of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever way appears to you, and expose it, and clean it according to each possibility you have, and with every means possible, as long as it does not cause conflict with a vein or nerve.
And know that the instruments for cutting and sawing these bones are very specific to the location of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their fineness and size, and their hardness and rarity; therefore, you must prepare appropriate tools for every kind of operation.
And know that this operation will indicate to you the type of instrument you need; when you have great study, long experience, and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience in dealing with diseases, then you will already know what tools are appropriate for every disease.
And I am giving you, at the end of this chapter, a list of the instruments you will need, which you will use in your procedure, which you will experiment on others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or ray-like shape). Let the head of this ray be shaped like a star-shaped keyhead, and its points be shaped like the points of an asterisk.
And it is only fitting that with this [the described ray shape] the heads of the joints be rubbed when they are corrupted, or the opening is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor.
Shape of a broad razor.
A well-made saw's shape:  an arch should be made on it, high and strong, its iron sharpness, and the blade of it should be a well-made wooden dagger. Shape of it (the saw, or possibly another previously mentioned tool).
Shape of a razor with a concavity.
Another subtle/refined shape of a razor.
Shape of another razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small razor resembling a tentacle.
Shape of another smaller cutting instrument.
Shape of another cutting instrument; this one resembling a ray, with a saw-like end, and is used in many places in bone surgery.
Shape of a ray that is suitable for the treatment of a bone that has been perforated.
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, all the things we have mentioned about razors, cutting instruments, and saws should be made of it.
Of cutting edges and the sawing of bones.
The extremities can be affected either by an internal or external cause, or if your treatment with those remedies does not improve the condition, or if the disease has advanced to a part of the limb that has not been affected by any cause, then you must cut that part of the limb where the illness has reached, in order to prevent the patient from dying or suffering worse damage to the limb.
And the sign of that which is happening is that the limb turns black, as if fire has burned it, or the blackness spreads until the hardness enters that limb, spreading throughout the body; then, cut it [the limb] with incisions.
And similarly, if the cause of the illness is the bite of venomous creatures, such as scorpions, vipers, or spiders, and the like...
And if the illness or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger and do not allow the illness to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if the illness reaches the hand, then you cut it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the illness to spread so that it reaches the arm's forearm.
And if instead of that, then cut the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the illness passes beyond the elbow, then in that case, it is the patient's death; and to administer any other treatment for this is a waste of effort.
And similarly, do the same for the foot. When the illness reaches the toe of the foot, then you cut it up to one of the ankles.
And if it takes hold in the arch of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it ascends up to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the illness has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy but resignation, and to leave the patient to death.
And the way to cut or sever the limb is to tighten the ligament in the area just below where you want to cut, and tighten another ligament above the spot; and the attendant should pull a ligament downwards and another upwards; and you separate the flesh between the two ligaments, widening the space until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be cut or severed.
And it is necessary to place a cloth on all sides so that it does not touch the affected area, and that the patient receives a regulated and carefully applied wound.
But if blood flows when you are working, then you cauterize the spot carefully, or place some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your procedure until it is complete.
And then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I relate to you what happened to a man on his foot, the same accident I and you have recounted, which is that a blackening of his foot occurred from a burn that was similar to a fire's combustion.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it extended to the entire foot.
And then the man himself prepared, since he saw the treatment proceeding to the affected limb with the intensity of the pain and burn he had experienced, and he incised that foot down to the joint, and thus was healed.
For a long time, that same corruption happened to him in the finger of his index hand.
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to dispel that superfluity with the application of medicinal remedies to his hand, effectively purifying his body; and the superfluity was not dispelled, and began to spread to the other fingers until it spread throughout the hand.
And he asked me to cut his hand open, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the superfluity to be dispelled, and fearing that cutting his hand open would lead to his death, because the patient's strength was at its weakest.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and it came to my attention that that man prepared himself and cut his entire hand open, and was healed.
And I have related this story not only to be helpful in understanding this illness, but also to serve as a sign, by which it is recognized and by which it is treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicinal remedies.
When an abscess occurs on fleshy parts of the body, and the abscess cavity becomes prolonged until it collects pus, and then it bursts and is pierced, and pus comes out, leaving an empty space like a vessel, and the surrounding skin is like a thin cloth, and it hasn't progressed to a deeper corruption, and it doesn't affect the bone, nerves, or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the cavity is prolonged until the corruption reaches any part of the body, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment for it is to cut through that surrounding skin, just as it is rolled, especially when it is thin and like a cloth, and making sure that it does not adhere to the affected area because of the corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres and that the corruption hasn't yet penetrated deeper, and there is a gap in the skin, then treat it with an enema.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large, and the discharge has a foul odor, then inject it with an Egyptian medicament, which is olive oil, sour wine, and vinegar taken in equal parts, and combined in a vessel, and heated over a fire until the mixture becomes reddish and takes on the consistency of honey.
Then, take what is necessary from this mixture, dissolve it with water and honey; use this to inject the sinus, and compress the opening, leaving the medicine there for about two hours.
Then, remove it with care; and do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the bad odor is gone.
And sometimes, if this medicament is unavailable, it is injected with ash water; and you should take the ashes of wood, and mix them with water; and then strain it and inject the sinus with it until you are confident that the sinus is then closed off.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicament or the ash water, then inject with water and honey, mixed with crushed vinegar, and inject with wine and honey mixed, for the nature of honey is to cleanse and wash, and wine helps to constrict the sinus, especially when the wine contains an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are confident that the sinus is now healed, then inject it with something that promotes flesh growth in that area.
And you should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent wine; or inject with other medicines and ointments that have the properties that I have already described in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the enema tube cannot be inserted, then you should enlarge it gradually with a small iron, and apply heat wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the lips together with sutures, leaving a quantity in which the enema tube enters without additional space.
And if the opening from which the protrusion is elevated to the upper parts, then dry that area in the lowest location possible so that the protrusion descends, for when the protrusion is cut into the depths of the sinus, flesh will be generated there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to the lowest bone as desired, then you must prepare the limb with a preparation through which the protrusion flows easily according to your equipment, and so that no cause retains the protrusion.
But the one over the sinus opening, which remains all the time to prevent what is adhering to the protrusion from coming out. And so that you may know if what comes out of the protrusion is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And with this, consider the location of the sinus; if the patient feels pain there, and if it is an abscess.
And when your treatment continues in this manner, and you see the material covering the sinus opening has adhered or is becoming attached, then on the third day, carefully remove the adhesion.  When you remove the plaster, change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle virus spreads, then do not be discouraged by the adhesion, for healing in such cases takes time; for some individuals, flesh generation takes longer in their wounds, while in others, the opposite occurs.
And if from the sinus undigested matter has been discharging for many days, then know that the sinus has not adhered; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause prolonged, then adjust the drying properties of the medicines.  If the medicines are moist in their substance and potency, they should be dried, like diaphanous ointment, when superfluous additions of zegi (possibly a type of medicinal ingredient) are adjusted in them.
The final remedy, with which to treat this, is to take diaphanous ointment, dissolve it in rubbed oil, and add aged wine that is viscous in its substance to it.  Mix these thoroughly and use the resulting mixture.
And similarly, in cases where there is no discharge, use diaphanous ointment, honey that has been boiled until thickened, and apply it; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind them all into powder, sprinkle it onto the heated honey, then spread this mixture on a cloth and bind it to the sinus.  Or use the thickened boiled honey, sprinkled onto a cloth, and apply that.
Sometimes, long-stemmed aristolochia and the roots of the lily of the valley (and it is the lily of the valley), and the flour of eryngo and centaury, are used. Grind these simple ingredients, sift, and sprinkle the powder onto the honey previously mentioned; use this mixture.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the underlying bone, or in other hard members or ligaments.  Then treat it with a fistular cure, as described above.
Of the treatment of whitlow, and of the afflicted nail, and of the incision of the added finger, and of the sectioning (or division).
Whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of a finger of the hand or foot, and frequently arises on other fingers.  If it is prolonged, and its treatment is less successful, or if it is an abscess from a hot abscess, or if it is corrupted, and puts forth pus until the root of the nail is eroded, and often entirely corrupts it, and often carries its corruption to the bone until it has a foul odor, and the fingertip is made gangrenous, and its color becomes dark.
And therefore, when you have done as we have said in the division, and your treatment does not succeed, then you must cut away all the remaining superfluity of the nail with an iron, and then cauterize the wound with this, for cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail's additions have already compressed the flesh to the surrounding parts, and are beginning to pierce and tear it, then you must place a fine needle under the angle of the nail that is piercing the flesh, and lift that flesh up and cut that flesh easily, and apply to what remains of the flesh burning and corrosive medicines until it is completely removed; and then treat it with salves until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then you must cut into that bone and remove it, for a bone corrupted in such a place is never healed.
And if the corruption and decay have spread to the finger, then you cut into it at one of the joints according to the means of its recovery, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail has suffered a blow or friction, and there is severe pain there, then you must first draw blood from the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument, making a transverse cut from above downward, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh underneath the nail, for this will cause the patient extreme pain and lead to a growth of unnecessary flesh in the area; and then treat that area with whatever relieves the pain.
But a finger that has grown abnormally large in some people's hands, is often fleshy, and often has excess bone, or extra nail growth.
And some of these growths are born at the base of the joint, or are born in some of the joints of the fingers. But that which grows in some of the finger joints is not harmful, and that which grows in the joints is often painful.
And for those that are fleshy growths, the cutting is easy, and you should slice it away from its base with a broad blade.
But for that which grows at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, be careful of cutting it off.
But for that which grows on the finger near the joints, you must first cut away the flesh around it, making a circular incision down to the bone, then use one of those appropriate saws to sever it, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the fingers stick together, either due to birth defects, or through a wound, burn, or similar, then you must sever that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place strips of cloth soaked in warmed oil between them to prevent them from adhering too quickly, and separate them, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until they have healed properly.
And similarly, if the fingers adhere to the palm, you must sever that adhesion according to the appropriate preparation and the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incisions of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are swollen, thick veins filled with melancholic superfluities that appear in various parts of the body, but most commonly in the legs, especially in travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purge of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
But the treatment of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they should be incised and the black blood drawn out, and the other method is that the vein should be raised and completely extracted.
The incision is done in this way: first, soak the leg with very hot water until the thick, phlegmy blood in the leg is resolved.  Then, tightly bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh down to just below the knee with a bandage. Then, cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.  Next, elevate the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upward, and then downward, until the desired amount of blood has been drawn, which will lessen the patient's illness.
And then bandage it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are filled again and this is noted in the patient.
But the raising of them is done this way: you take the patient's leg, if it is very hairy, then place it in a bath and soak the leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins are prominent; or, if a bath is unavailable, you apply a vigorous exercise until the limb is heated.
And then cut the vein on the right side of the vein, by incision either along the back of it from the knee down, or lower on the back of the foot.
And then open the vein with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears sensitive, and you see the reddish colour turning to black.
And then, as you evacuate, you see a white cord-like substance from the vein.
And then you place a rag under it until it is raised and pulled out of the vein, and suspend it with a hook or a lion's claw.
And then make another incision near that incision, after three days, and scrape the vein on the upper side until it appears.
And then raise that [part of the vein] and cut it in a posterior incision towards the heel.  Then pull that out and lift it until it emerges through the second incision, and then pull it out of the incision that is above it.
Do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until it is all out; and then cut that [the remaining part].
And if you are unable to pull and raise it, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and pull it out, or place a rag under it and rotate your hand around until it is expelled. Be careful that it is not cut; for if it is broken, it will be difficult for you to raise that vein, and it will cause harm to the patient.
And when you have completely removed it, then place on the wound area wool soaked in olive oil (both plain and medicated), and treat it until healed.
And if the vein is twisted, having contortions and folds in its parts, and is not straight as we have said, then you must cut on those contorted parts and folds in it, and then grasp it with hooks until you have lifted the whole vein.
Be careful with your incision not to cut the vein and cause it to be damaged, for it will be difficult for you to raise it; and use your caution in this.
Shape of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not too sharp, like hooks, nor does it have a sharp point, so as not to damage the vein; and it should be of a thick and flexible material.  For if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness;  and therefore it has the necessary, but not excessive thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like in the land of the Arabs, and in the hot, arid lands of India, where there is little vegetation and no herbs or trees grow.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its formation is from putrefaction that arises from beneath the skin, like serpents, worms, and maggots that breed between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this [vein problem] is a vehement inflammation in the leg; and soon the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that blister, as if a plant were growing.
And then, when its extremity appears, you should wrap a lead weight around it, whose weight is of one drachma to two drachmas.  Secure it and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
And as many times as there is any cause outside the affected areas, wrap that in lead and secure it. And if the condition is prolonged, then you should cut away a portion of it and cover the remaining part.  And do not cut it (the affected area) so that it becomes exposed, for if you cut it it can become constricted and enter the flesh, causing a boil or ulcer and a bad wound in that location.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from behind it and no trace of it remains within the body.
And from this vein, some men have had it grow to a length of five palms and ten fingers, and it has come to my attention that one has extended to twenty palms.
And if it is incised during its treatment, then insert a probe into its opening and pierce it with a long probe throughout the body, until all that is in the material is evacuated, and apply a suppurating treatment to the area for a few days using medicines; and then treat it as you would an abscess.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and has many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening.
And therefore treat it as we have said in the division and with what has been stated above.
Of the cutting of worms generated beneath the skin, and it is called the bovine illness.
This illness is called bovine disease in some lands near us, because it often affects cattle, and is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh, and travels throughout the body up and down, and is felt by its movement from one limb to another until it bursts through the skin and exits.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, as occurs with worms, snakes, earthworms, and ascarids in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it travels through the body and reaches the head, and arrives at the eye, it strongly presses upon it and enters, destroying the eye, and this happens often.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is done only based on its movement and appearance as felt, and then it is necessary to tightly bind and constrict that which is above and below it, and then cut on it and extract it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the primary fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the area, as we have said.
And if you see that being near the eye socket, then press upon the eyebrow with a firm constriction, and then cut on it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of the body with medicines to evacuate bad putrid humors, and that they guard against foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the incision upon the ailment.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain that comes upon certain limbs, and then moves from one limb to another.
And I have already seen that, as I have told you. I was called to a sick woman in a town, and I examined her arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm's forearm.  After an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm ascending the arm, but more quickly than one might expect, like living silver moving from place to place.
And then the pain moved to that area and settled into the muscle, and then I remained there for an hour.
And then it moved to the other arm until it reached the other arm.
And then I observed it moving throughout her entire body as I watched; and I was greatly amazed by its movement from limb to limb and its speed. And I had previously seen something like this with my own eyes, but I have often observed pain shifting from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my own eyes in this way in the woman.
And I did not consider it to be anything other than that because the woman was old, with dry body and exposed veins, and this apparent shifting of the air/wind was felt in this way.
And it is necessary that this "backward-healing" (or "reverse healing") not appear in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, so you gently and lightly press on the area until that trapped wind/air is released, and cauterize the affected area.
But if you don't see it with your eyes, then you cure it with body cleansing and with things that expel wind/air, and use aromatic pills and pills of [herbal remedy "serapi"] and similar remedies.
Of extracting arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their type and the body parts they are aimed at, for their diversity lies in those with large points, small points, concave shapes, blunt shapes, solid shapes; and those with three angles, and those with tongues; and those with feathers.
And the signs of brain injury are when an arrow hits it and pierces the skull, and exits the cranium above the brain, for it causes sudden severe pain, dizziness, vertigo, and redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion of mind, and vomiting of yellow bile; and the ability to speak is severely impaired, and the voice is lost; and from the wound site, a white, dust-like moisture exits, and the area around the wound is similar to the watery consistency of flesh.
Therefore, if you see these signs, then you refrain from treatment and from extracting the arrow, unless it is protruding.
But the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left nipple, are that it feels as though it has struck a solid object, and not an empty space; and the arrow's movement is very similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound; and the patient feels coldness in the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; and therefore know that death is certain without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are profuse frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck become inflamed, the patient's complexion changes, they exhale heavily, and they crave a rush of cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the foot, the pain is then near the small ribs, and great pain and gasping are caused, and all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then immediately undigested food will come from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is embedded, there is a visible tear in the wound, or the intestines or flesh are ruptured, and there is no hope for a cure beyond removing the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine flows from the wound, and some cause of harm spreads to the exterior parts, and severe pain affects the patient, then know that it is fatal.
But the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, and limbs adjacent to them, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, the thigh, and the leg, and their similar parts, are safe according to the greatest dispositions when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I tell you this, what I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may consider this in your treatment.
Which is why, when an arrow hits a man's tear duct, near the root of his nose, and I removed it from the other side, below the ear, and he recovered, and no damage occurred to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the area of his eye, beneath the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden, and only a small extremity of it could be retrieved, attached to its shaft. It was a large, sharp arrow of the Turks, with a lion's head, which had no barbs.
And the Jew recovered, and no harm came to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat; it was an Arabic arrow, and it had barbs.  It had sunk into his throat, so I made a small incision beside it, and then carefully extracted it. The Christian recovered.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his stomach, and I thought he would die because of it.  However, after 30 days had passed and no change in his condition was evident, I incised the arrow and worked around it, and he recovered, and no further harm came to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his back, and the wound healed over it.  After approximately seven years, the arrow emerged near the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her stomach, and the wound healed inside her.  There was no change in her condition, and the woman experienced no harm to any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face, and the wound healed over.  The arrow remained embedded, causing little pain, and the outcome was similar to the previous cases.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's nobleman, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and had already shifted slightly to the right side.  The entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow was lodged, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight.  Then I probed it gently with a fine instrument, and felt nothing; but he felt a prickling sensation below his right ear, and so I concluded that this prickling was caused by the arrow's tip.
And I applied a plaster to the area, one with attractive and digestive properties, confident that the wound would suppurate so that I could see the arrowhead, allowing it to heal over.
And no significant event occurred at the site, that the arrow had indeed reached that spot; and I continued to apply the plaster for many days and no mishap occurred; and the wound healed in the meantime, and the patient recovered from the extraction over many days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and reported this to me.
Then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened, and with the probe I tested it, and found a small arrowhead, adhering to the shaft.
And then I carefully treated the wound with that sharp medicine until the arrowhead became visible, and I spent time with this for a period of about four months.
And then, since the wound had become enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and it remained immobile, I did not cease to explore and devise ways to extract it, until one day I began to extract it with carefully crafted forceps, as their shape is described at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed the wound.
Some doctors thought the cartilage of the nose was not reparable, but I repaired it and the wound healed completely, and the patient was restored to full health, and suffered no further ill effects.
I recount to you the method of removing certain arrows, so that you may consider this a rule and a guide for what I have not said, for the parts of this art and the definitions are not fully comprehended by narration nor does this book encompass them all.
Skilled artisans compare little with much; and with what is present, with what is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments for removing foreign objects from the art when accidents occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the limbs in which they are lodged except in two ways: either by traction of the place where they entered; or by force from the other part.
And that which is expelled through the place of entry, or is an arrow lodged in a fleshy area, is pulled and expelled.
And if you do not follow this method immediately when it occurs, then you must leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and the pull and expulsion are eased.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow this method, leave it for several days and repeat the extraction with traction and movement each day, and it will be expelled.
And if you do not follow this method for a few days, then you must make an incision around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine drill until the space around the arrow is enlarged, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden within the body, and is hidden from sight, then you should locate it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it out with instruments suitable for extraction.
And if you cannot do this because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the shaft, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then you should work on the wound until it is enlarged and the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is lodged in the ears, holding it, then you should free the flesh in which it is lodged from every side with all the skill you can; and work on that, if you cannot by making the flesh give way by breaking the ears and twisting them until you succeed.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any place where it is, then use twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until you make it yield; and be very careful so that the arrow is not broken and its extraction is made difficult for you.
And if you cannot do it at the moment, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues can heal, and then repeat the procedure when it is less inflamed. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then administer the treatment we have discussed in the relevant chapter.
And exercise your skill in cutting a vein or nerve, or tendon, and use every possible method for the removal of the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I and as you have been told.
And therefore, position the arrow so that the patient's position corresponds to the way the arrowhead penetrated their body, as this is more beneficial. But if that is not possible, then you should administer whatever is possible according to the procedures.
However, if the arrowheads are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow has already passed through the outer tissues, or if the arrowhead's tip has become embedded in the part of the body closest to the skin (and sometimes even more prominent), then you should cut it there.  The incision should correspond to the amount the forceps can grasp; and then extract it, as it has become loosened.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you should twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead firmly grips the bone, and expands accordingly, and then remove it.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is also there, then you should push it out with it.
However, if the shaft has fallen and you want to administer a push, then you should insert, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that its concavity fits into the arrow's tail, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrow is eased by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut away all the flesh where the arrowhead is, if possible, and then treat it with whatever is appropriate.
And if the arrow hits the foot, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or the side, and is near enough that you can touch it with the probe, and it is possible to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it, and then treat the wound if necessary, and heal it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Their tips should be like the beak of a bird, shaped like a saw when they grip the arrow so they don't let go.
And of those [forceps] many varieties are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and the patient's constriction.
like a ray so that the insertion of it [the object being pushed] into the concave arrowhead is eased and propelled by that [pusher].
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which there are thirty, of which some are in chapter sixteen, are: two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the temples; two veins in the tear ducts, called *aspicientz*; the vein in the middle of the forehead; the vein at the end of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip; these are called *algelic*; and two veins below the tongue. But the veins that are bled in the arms are five: one is the cephalic vein, located by the wild side (or, the wild part), and is called by the people "the head vein", and is a blunt, middling vein, and is composed of one branch of the basilica and another branch of the cephalic vein.  The people call this one "the vein of the whole body."  The basilica vein is the one located on the domestic side, and is called "citillar"  and the common people call it "the belly vein." There is the vein of the forearm, situated over the elbow, and that is the one that is bled, and is the one that appears prominently on the elbow.  There is the "salvatella", the vein that lies between the aforementioned auricular finger and the smallest finger, and is in two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins: one is located below the bend of the knee on the wild side; the second is the *sophena*, and its location is below the leg on the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, located below the leg on the wild side; and there are other veins similar to these in the leg.
The relief of the veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, and sores of the head.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I advise you, is to first smooth the patient's head, and rub the patient's head at the back of the head in the location of both the veins with a wide cloth with good friction. Then gently hold the patient's neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations near the ears in two depressions on the top of the head appear. Then probe with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then proceed with the incision.
Then take the lancet, which is the sharp one, and insert it under the vein in the groove until the incision reaches the bone. Then lift your hand along the vein and groove to the sides above and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And the length of the incision should be the amount of two fingers joined together or thereabouts; and let the blood flow out as much as you wish.
And then apply compresses and leave it until it is healed.
And the incision of these [veins] and their cauterization have already been discussed at the beginning of the book.
However, for the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for ancient migraines, often wicked and persistent, and eye inflammations (ophthalmia), and for the discharge of acute excess fluids in the eyes.
And the method of performing phlebotomy on them is as I recommend to you:  constrain the patient's neck until the two veins appear visibly, and the pulse of them is felt under your finger; and then you make the incision with the lancet.
And then you elevate the skin over the vein with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and elevate the vein upwards; and incise it just as you have done on the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the quantity needed.
And then release the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place poultices and powders over it and bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed.
And the remembrance of them, and of those incisions and extractions, is already preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, phlebotomy of the vein on the forehead is suitable for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for chronic facial ailments, migraines, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the procedure for phlebotomy is as I recommend to you; that is, the patient should bind their head with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument, which is called a "fossor," which has this form:
Place the pointed end of the fossor onto that vein, and strike it with a mallet or similar tool, in the manner described, and let the blood flow as much as you wish; then release the patient's constriction and bind it until healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, but the phlebotomy should not be with a sharp end like the other phlebotomies, but rather a blunt end, and phlebotomize it transversely, because the bone is close and strong, and the phlebotomy will break it if it is too thin.
However, the treatment for the two veins located near the tear ducts, for eye scabies, eye irritation, and eye inflammation, and for facial ailments.
The procedure for phlebotomy is that the patient should bind their neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over their head.
And the phlebotomy should be made transversely, a little lengthwise with a shallow incision, for there is no flesh in that location; and if the phlebotomy is too thin, the end of it will very easily break.
And then let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and apply a cloth to those places, and bind them for a night, and then unbind them.
However, phlebotomy of the nasal vein is suitable for acute fevers and violent headaches, and for facial ailments, migraines, and inflammation of the face, especially if it is chronic.
And the method for this phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck and then hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long lancet, and place it in the middle of the nose's top section in a straight line, for the vein is not apparent to the touch here, and so that the blood begins to flow immediately.
You should slowly move the small lancet with your hand and allow the blood to flow as needed; and then bandage that area for a night, for it will heal quickly.
However, phlebotomy of both arms is beneficial for constriction of the throat, the onset of leprosy, many illnesses, impetigo, and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the method for phlebotomy of those [arms] is that the patient should hold each arm below their neck with a bandage; and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a chair.
Then, carefully cut the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet, little by little; and then draw blood in a moderate amount, or according to the needs of the situation; and then do the same for the other vein.
Then remove the bandage, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not overly affected, and leave it on until morning, for the wound will be healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy on the veins of the face is for small boils and pustules of the mouth, and corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
The method for phlebotomy of those [veins of the face] is to have the patient sit before you, and tie their neck with a bandage.  Then, you should retract the lips, and look for two veins: one on the right side of the lip, and the second on the left.  The indication of each is the darkness of each, for in the vicinity of those are small, dark veins; and then make an incision on each with a sharp incision.
But if there is doubt, and you do not know which of those is the correct one, then proceed to the incision of the largest and most obvious of those.
And do the same with the two veins that are on the upper lips.
But for two veins located below the tongue, the benefit of phlebotomy is primarily for inflammations in the throat, for uvula ailments, and for illnesses of the mouth.
And the method of performing phlebotomy on those veins is to hold the patient between your hands in front of the sun, raise their tongue, and look under the tongue, locating the vein on one side and on the other side, and the colour of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each vein; and be careful not to cut too deeply on those veins, for below them are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which are customarily found in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either with a mirtillat or an olive-shaped lancet, with a subtly tapering point; or to cut with a knife lancet, and to call it alnessil, and this is their form:
Its blade should be as sharp as possible, and it is appropriate for opening full, prominent, large concave veins, and those containing thick, clotted blood.
This phlebotomy is of a smaller width and a more subtle tip, and it is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins containing thin, citrus-like blood.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilica vein, which is one of three veins, is that it draws blood from illnesses located below the throat and neck, and from those affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on that vein, to be very careful and extremely cautious, for below it lies an artery; and if they err and are careless in the phlebotomy puncture, they will cut that artery and cause a flood of blood. Therefore, it is necessary that one not phlebotomize it with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, but rather with a slicing one, like a lancet.
And if the basilica vein is not readily apparent, then you should leave it and move to another vein, or seek a branch of it; or you should phlebotomize in a visible area at the end of the arm, for that is apparent; and cut it with a slicing phlebotomy instrument, as we have said.
However, if you wish to phlebotomize that same vein, then you must first constrict the arm until you find the location of the pulse, and then gently press on it with your hand.  Then, tie the arm and slice the vein with a concave incision using a lancet-style phlebotomy tool, as we have described; and be careful to avoid touching the artery by a small distance.
And when, as you tighten the bandage, you see swelling in the area you have marked with your hand, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that area.
And if you see the blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is a thin, watery red, then understand that it is blood from the artery.  Then you should quickly cover and place your finger over that area for a short time; then remove your finger, and if the blood is discontinuous (i.e., stopped), because often it is discontinuous, then you tighten the arm and leave it alone.
And watch the patient carefully, and be cautious of the infection, and do not neglect it for several days until it is healed.
However, if the blood is not discontinuous, and you see that you don't have the appropriate medicine for this, then you should cut the artery, if it appears appropriate to you; for the extremity is constricted, and the blood is discontinuous.  Or take the bark of a fig tree, pulverize it, and take half of it, and apply it over the vein's location with a tightly bound bandage and powders until the following day.
And if the blood is discontinuous, that is good; and if not, then treat it with whatever was previously mentioned in the memory of the place, the powders, discontinuing the blood flow.
And the stopping of the blood from that location is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But in the case of the superficial vein, phlebotomy is useful in drawing blood from the superior part of the head and lower part of the body;  because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious in performing phlebotomy on this vein, for below it lies a nerve; and if, during the phlebotomy incision, the nerve is accidentally struck, the patient will experience numbness, and healing will be difficult, and often the patient will not be completely healed.  This nerve is often noticeable; but if it is hidden from some people, and is subtle and not apparent, then it is necessary that you perform the phlebotomy with a blade, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy on the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for illnesses of the eyes.
And in this case, if you want to perform phlebotomy, use a lancet made of olive wood or myrtle wood; for it is the safest of all the veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, an abscess is sometimes present in some men, when it is not opened by the first incision, and you do not discover that abscess.
The first of these is that you should understand that phlebotomy is performed only for the preservation of health and in the hope of preventing illness.  It should be performed on one of the veins in the arm, namely: cephalic, basilic, and the median cubital; and phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter, near the mealtime, when there are signs of fullness.
And phlebotomy should be performed either on the third day, or as soon as three hours have passed from the initial incision.
However, phlebotomy should be performed when there is a need or appropriateness for it, whether by night or by day, at any hour and any time.
And it is necessary that a child not be bled until they are 14 years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled until the fourth month until the seventh, and the elderly, who have already passed 60 years, should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled in any way, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a [herbal] enema, if they have much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the bowels during the phlebotomy, which are impure and might harm the principal limbs.
And those suffering from nausea, vomiting, or cramping, or from illness or drunkenness, should not be bled until this is relieved; nor should patients with dropsy.  Moreover, phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sexual activity, strenuous work, or exertion, or fasting or vigils, and any cause that weakens the body or spirit.
And one should consider the excess of humours beforehand; if the blood is thick, [treat it] with foods and drinks, and with medicines, if possible.
And if no reason prevents it, one should enter a bath, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood might be made thinner.
And perform the phlebotomy on the patient in the early part of the day, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful emotional influences, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all physical afflictions, such as excessive exertion, pain, sexual activity, and similar things.
And have present at his side things that are customarily used by people to relieve discomfort with aromatics, scents, balms, and similar things, according to what is possible.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion the person to be bled is sitting on.
And then, the phlebotomist should extend his arm, and rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the bandage with a strap and wrap it around twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not appropriate, or if it is excessive, then prohibit the flow of blood; or if it is too soft, then prohibit the blood's flow as well.
And then, the person to be bled should rub their hands together until the veins are inflamed and clearly visible.
And then the phlebotomist should anoint their lancet with a little of good, old olive oil; and then place their left index finger on that vein, below the place where they want to make the incision, so that the vein is slightly raised and the pulse is slowed, for it is the vein that is found beating like a string fleeing the incision, and from those that are full of air, when you place the lancet on them, it is drawn towards the incision, and the phlebotomist is aware of it; and if the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does, that vein is tight.
Therefore, for this reason, the phlebotomist must be careful and diligent in all these matters.
And then, they should apply the lancet again, but if the vein is opened in one attempt, then it is good; and if not, repeat this procedure slightly below that spot, or slightly above it, quickly, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will bring on a violent inflammation, nor should they bathe.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood is coming out as desired, then you should repeat the phlebotomy in the same incision, and adjust the opening slightly, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, for the area becomes inflamed in many people after only a small opening.
But if the area is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure, for there is no benefit to you; and apply a piece of oiled cloth over it, as this will ease the flow of blood. And oil is better in this location than other oils.
And similarly, apply oiled cloths in every phlebotomy, for the phlebotomy of veins aims to reduce the flow of blood.  This is done by applying theriac, aloes, and sagzenea (likely specific herbal remedies) once applied to the area, because the blood is refined and reduced when it becomes thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the phlebotomy, as often happens, especially in someone who hasn't been bled before or in cases of a small vein opening, then you must cauterize and apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the area, and compress it for an hour, for it will dissolve (the swelling).
And this should be done near the point of blood flow from that vein, along with pressure on that or another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the area for a few days, do not worry.  If you wish, apply a mixture of aloes and myrrh dissolved, or some mint or balm extract or something similar to it.
Often, abscesses and swellings occur following phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Therefore, place your hand upon it, and if you find softness under your pressure there, then that swelling is bad and dangerous; and then be careful not to place anything there, of what we have said, because blood will easily flow from the artery.
Make a poultice of something astringent, so that the area hardens, and then treat it with further remedies until healed.
It is necessary to draw blood from each person according to the amount of their strength and according to the color and appearance of the blood.
For if the blood is dark, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one sitting, that the vein be opened widely and the incision be deep.
And for one who is weak, the opposite must be done, and it is necessary to draw it out in several sittings, and the opening should be narrow.
The best method in bloodletting from a vein is a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting avoids excessive blood flow and nerve damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the length or width of the vein.
And for those who are prone to fainting during bloodletting, you should treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in mulberries or simple vinegar warmed up; and extract a small amount of blood in three or four sittings.
And if the patient has a cold constitution, then before bloodletting, give them bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup seasoned with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar aromatic syrups.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is caused by the excessive loss of blood, then the patient should drink water with meat broth and a very fragrant, subtle syrup; and use aromatics like rue, and gently bathe their feet with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on fainting caused by evacuation.
And those who want to improve their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, should be aware that bloodletting is a method of significant evacuation, and its virtue is slow, so it evacuates blood little by little, according to the quantity of virtue in the continuing days.
But if someone wants to improve their arm, and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then do so approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But if one wants to draw the blood of their body to the opposite part of the body where it is declining, then it should be improved on the second or third day.
However, in a body where the blood is already very heated and is causing a fever, blood must be drawn in one session, and a large amount must be released, increasing the procedure until fainting occurs, provided all bloodletting conditions have been observed.  And you should place your hand over the patient's pulse on their body part that the blood is drawn from, to ensure that the procedure doesn't result in death instead of fainting, for this often occurs when the bloodletter is ignorant and careless.
And when you want to improve the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, since the vein's opening is already closed and the blood flow is difficult, do not press on it forcefully, and do not unnecessarily stretch or bend it, for that is very bad.
Leaving it until the arm is blood-let a second time; or remove this by treating the blood clot in the vein's opening; or apply theriac, alfarach, or sagzenea to it, and compress it lightly until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you should draw blood from that spot or from another vein in the other arm.
And the vein called the "cord of the arm" is bled instead of the cephalic or basilic veins, when those are not found or hidden, because it is composed of those veins.
And the procedure for bleeding him is that the patient should immerse his hand in warm water until the vein becomes red and clearly visible.
And then apply a bandage around it with moderate tightness; and then bleed along the small transverse vein, not lengthwise nor laterally.
And if the opening is wide, make your incision with the lancet a little above the wrist joint.
And if the flow of blood is stopped, then you immerse the hand in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your desired result.
However, if you are in the summer months, you are excused from immersing the hand in warm water, and the patient's body is placed in warm water in the winter.
And the lancing of this vein is safer than all other veins, for below it there is no pulsating vein or nerve.
And the lancing of the vein on the right forearm is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the technique of the lancing is that you hold the arm with a bandage or with your hand, after placing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then make a transverse incision; and if you cut it all the way through, it will not harm it at all.
And be careful not to injure your hand during the lancing, for below it are the nerves of the exposed fingers.
And then return the arm to the warm water and allow the blood to flow from it, for if you don't return it to warm water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein, and the flow will be hindered.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the required amount, then place oil and salt on the vein so it does not clot quickly; and similarly, you should do this on every incision.
However, the benefit of bloodletting from the left arm is that it is helpful for diseases of the spleen.
And do similarly in the bloodletting of the other (arm), as you did in the first.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the cephalic vein is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the mother (meaning, perhaps, female reproductive issues), and for retention of menses, and for diseases of the kidneys, and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the procedure for bloodletting from that location is that the patient immerse their foot in warm water and apply friction until the veins appear; and tie the area around the foot with a bandage; and the spot where the vein appears is to be cut with a lancet,  and from there it branches out to many small vessels on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, lance the widest vein or one below the leg, near the heel, towards its confluence, because it is better and more effective.
And if you are bloodletting on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves beneath that surface, and make your incision across the vein, as if you were intending to cut it through.
And let the bloodletting be skillful.
But if the release of blood is prohibited, then you immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow out until it is evacuated.
And if the blood-letter errs the first time, then repeat the bloodletting slightly higher, for the spot is healthy; and do not fear harming them, but rather be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same on the sole of the other foot also.
And for the sciatic vein, the spot, as we have said, is below the heel, under the bone of the outer side.
And the benefit of bloodletting him is for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood.
And the procedure for bloodletting him is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly bind the thigh, from the wide part, up to above the heel with a long, thin bandage for four days, for it appears only through this.
And therefore, when it appears, then you should perform phlebotomy on that spot using any possible and suitable instrument; either cut it with an incision or make a section cut, for the site is good/suitable for the treatment.
And it is often hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it doesn't appear on touch, then lance a branch of it.  This is the one that appears on the back of the foot near the aforementioned auricular and annular (joints/areas).
And be careful of the nerves, and let the blood flow out in the quantity you desire.
And then, release the constriction and place a compress on the site of the phlebotomy and tightly bind the area, for it will heal quickly.
Of cupping and the qualities of their use.
Cupping is of horns, or of reeds, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with incision and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping that is without incision is in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And to the cuppings that are administered with incision and blood extraction are fourteen places on the body, of which the first place where cupping is placed is the occiput, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle place of it is of two parts of the neck together; and cuppings of the chin below the jaw and below the mouth; and cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and cuppings of the elbow, and are above the end of the forearm; and cuppings of the two biceps; and cuppings of the two elbows; and cuppings of the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the virtue of those veins, as happens with phlebotomy; nor is it necessary that cupping be done with or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
However, if necessity prompts cupping for illness or for a continuous condition, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
And therefore, when in any of these cases, and specifically if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we order cupping to be done after two or three hours have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it relieves heaviness in the head and what is affecting the eyes; but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the location of the cephalic vein's bloodletting.
And it is not permissible for one who is of a cold constitution, or in whom there is a cold, to use it, for it gives them great harm.
And therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly, or those with cold diseases of the head, to use it.
But for whoever is continuously affected by it, it causes oblivion; and therefore, you must command the cupper to gently move their hand a little below the cup, fearing the generation of oblivion.
However, cupping with alcohol is in the place of bloodletting from the vena fusca and basilica veins: and therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, constriction of the breath, splitting of the breath's instrument, coughs, and congestion.
And it is necessary that the alcohol cupping be slightly raised, for if it is placed lower, it engenders weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* is beneficial for accidental pains in the head, and for ophthalmia, migraine, and fevers, and for pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is a substitute for bloodletting from the basilica vein.
And you must instruct the cupper not to press their hand with incision, so that they do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and for similar mouth ailments, and it is in place of bloodletting from the vessels (or blood vessels) along the two lips.
But cupping done above the two shoulder blades is beneficial for heatstroke, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two sides within the armpits is beneficial as much as bloodletting from three veins, namely the basilica, cephalic, and brachial veins, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, and those small veins draw from the larger veins until the drawing is accomplished in the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to overdo the incision, for the area is lacking flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping treatment applied to the buttocks is beneficial for hemorrhoids and ulcers located lower down.
And you should instruct the cupper to use a large, strong cupping glass, because the area needs a strong suction; and weak, flimsy cupping glasses are easily broken and are better avoided.
However, cupping on the legs should be done sparingly, for they draw blood from the entire body, and it benefits old pains in the kidneys, liver, and bladder; it also brings on menstruation, and relieves heaviness and swelling; it is similar in effect to bloodletting from two main veins, and then, afterward, from two lesser veins.
However, it greatly weakens the whole body and can cause fainting in many people.
And the benefit of cupping in this way is similar to the benefit of cupping both legs.
And the quality of applying cupping is to place the cupping glass empty at first and to suck gently, and do not prolong the cupping, but place them lightly, and remove them promptly, so that the humors come to the area by flowing in. And do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the area reddening and swelling and the redness of the blood appears.
And then you make incisions and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the disposition of the body.
For that person with delicate, easily injured skin, you should make incisions only once, lest the area become ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the incision slightly, and to moderate the suction gently.
And if the blood is thickened, then you should make incisions twice, because on the first occasion, the path for the blood and its watery elements is opened. But on the second, the scrutiny gained from the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made to achieve the final result.
And finally, when we want to extract little by little or a small amount of blood, a single incision is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make deep incisions.
And the term for incision is one in which the depth is only the width of a fingernail.
And if the area where the fingernail is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, then the places for the cupping vessels should be rubbed with remedies that are soothing, opening, and resolving; if it is summer, such as almond oil or violet oil, or the oil of soft almonds, or the oil of poppy seed; and if it is winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be of amaranth, or balm, or almond, or dill, and their similar ones.
But if the person being cupped has wide pores in tender flesh, then it is necessary to prohibit the use of oil, and it is necessary that the areas around the cupping jars be washed with water or with cool water from solanum, or poppy water, or water of wood sorrel, and similar ones.
And for someone whose blood is of moist and heavy nature, wash their cupping jars with sour wine, or water of myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
And for those whose superfluities are thick, wash their cupping jars with old wine, or with water of balm (majorana), or with a decoction of dill, or chamomile, and the like.
And the cupping should be guarded before a bath; having been administered shortly after the bath, for one or two hours, and it is necessary that they rest after the cupping.
What is that which should be governed (or controlled) in the person being cupped (or bled) before the cupping (or bloodletting)?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person being cupped, or the one about to be bled, is choleric and has blood that is sharp and inflamed, then it is necessary that they take things that cool it, such as  milfoil (or similar astringents), endive in sour wine, lettuce, and secanabin, and juleps, and the like.
And give them foods like pomegranates, and the flesh of small birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and the like.
And for someone whose constitution is cold, it is necessary that they drink almiva syrup, or alsecanabin seed syrup, and sumac, and a moderately sweet wine, neither too old nor too young; and they should be advised to eat little and drink little, and give them foods like pomegranates, hempseed, pigeons, and small birds.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more than the food.
And it is necessary to give some people theriac alpharac, or musk-based medicines, that is to say musk, or alchelite, before the cupping or bloodletting or shortly thereafter, so that the main parts of the body are strengthened and the blood is refined;  and it is not necessary for them to take it heated.
But the cupping that is done without incision should be applied to the liver, spleen, gout, and navel, on the knee joints, and the groin area, because these parts do not tolerate incision on them.
And it is not sought for them, but rather the drawing of blood from a limb, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in a sickness of blood flowing from the nose; and we use this so that cold, trapped wind in the limb is dissolved, as we apply to the stomach and navel; for this action rarifies the limb, warms it, and lessens the pain, because it resolves the wind.
And it is already placed on the lungs when they are congested or full of phlegm, for by the power of strong suction it readily opens congestion and eradicates the phlegm from its location.
And similarly, it works when placed on the liver and spleen to draw out wind trapped within them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty, with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and becomes larger; this is either just hot water or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass administered with fire:  Let the opening's width be two fingers, as we have shaped it; and let the amount of the heated portion be half a palm; and let it be on his side, in the area that is within the curve, half of it; the hole should be small enough that only a needle's thickness could enter it.
It should be made of a reddish or citrus wood, with thick margins, lion, oak, and elm for it to not harm the limb, maintaining its position on it.
And in its middle should be a transverse rod of wood or iron, upon which a candle with fire is placed.
And this cupping glass should be significantly larger than the one we previously described; and the smaller one should be adjusted depending on the illnesses and age of the person using it.
The cupping glasses for children and the weak are different from those for young adults and those with strong bodies.
And the method of applying this cupping glass with fire to the limb is to heat the charcoal with decent wood fire before a small beeswax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so the fire is lit around the lower portion, so that the patient's body is not burned.
Then, it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be placed on the hole we mentioned, until when we have the cupping glasses and don't need them to be shown, and the vapor escapes through the hole, then the cupping glass will quickly dissolve.
And ignite the charcoal according to its method, and repeat it if you need it.
But a cupping glass used for pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod nor hole, and is not administered unless filled with water, and is placed directly onto the limb.
And this is its form:  And the larger this cupping glass is, the better, because it can receive a larger quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where cupping is not possible, due to their small size, such as the foot and the gums, and similar parts; or to a limb without flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and their similar parts.
And the quality to use of those leeches, if you have found leeches, is in the still, clear waters of muddy areas.
And they should be left in fresh water day and night until they are hungry, and no food remains in their stomach; and then the body should be emptied initially with bloodletting and cupping; and then the patient's limb should be rubbed until it turns red; and then they should be placed on it.
And when they are full and loosened.
And if suction from the area with a cupping device is possible, it is better for the improvement.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with clean water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged, when the leeches are drawing blood, and it is oozing, then you immerse a cloth in cold water and place it over it until the oozing is stopped.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle powdered vitriol, or other similar styptic substances, onto the area until the bleeding is stopped; or place roasted bean halves over the area and leave them until the beans adhere to the spot, and the bleeding is stopped.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, when it's possible to change them.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being applied, then the area should be rubbed with fresh blood, or a needle should be inserted into the area until blood flows; and then applied, for those, when they sense any blood, quickly adhere.
And when you want them to drop off, sprinkle a little powdered aloes, or salt, or ashes on them, and they will fall off quickly.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidental injuries to the bones.
O, son, know that foolish and vulgar doctors, and those who have never consulted the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them, boast about this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of learned men in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at all in any way; and I have not adopted this from what I have learned, but rather through the length of my reading of the Ancients' books and my study of their understanding until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And I will henceforth dedicate myself to experimentation and study throughout the length of my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experiment has been performed; since I have summarised this for you and freed it from unnecessary length; and I have shortened it in conclusion; and have shown it in its final explanation; and have presented in it many forms of instruments that are used in it, as it is done by adding an explanation, just as I have done in the two previous chapters.
First Chapter.
Summaries and collections of bone fractures, and of those things that are necessary to be addressed before we begin to discuss the healing of broken bones and various types of fractures. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with a summary of the subject matter; and the topics that must be understood at the outset by artisans and those who seek to understand the truth of these matters; that is, you, and those who are eager to learn or to teach this noble art, either from you or others.
And so I say that when an accident occurs involving a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or a fall, then it is necessary that you begin with bloodletting or to lessen the inflammation, or both, if no reason prevents it, such as weakness of the patient's constitution, or if the person who has been injured is a child, or old and decrepit, or if the time is one of intense heat or intense cold.
And afterward, the patient should consume cool herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and we forbid fatty meats and foods that fill the veins with blood, until you are sure of a hot abscess, and if you do not fear the effusion of matter onto the limb.
And then return the patient to their original regimen, with which they are accustomed.
And so, when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the patient eat nutritious foods, substantial and heavy foods in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and barley, and calf's feet and entrails, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar things to them, and with this regimen, the fracture is made to coagulate more easily and better.
And know that broken bones in the elderly and decrepit, in those in the initial stages of their frailty, cannot be joined and consolidated according to their natural process because of the drying up of their limbs.
But nonetheless, nature brings together and binds around the broken bone from every side a substance somewhat like glue, thick and adhering, which holds it together until it is completely conjoined and tightly bound, until it reaches its full strength and firmness, just as fire at the beginning, until nothing hinders it in its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient's diet consist of foods that are heavy, viscous, and substantial, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly, all the other limbs have different fractures.
And I come with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is a great variety of fractures within themselves. (or:  Many different kinds of fractures exist.) And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for a fracture is sometimes arched, sometimes splintered; and sometimes a fracture runs along the length of the bone: and these are fractures of the bone in the shape of stars, and splinters, and pieces that are either a result of, or not a result of, the injury, just as happens in a pen when it is prepared to write, and there is a fracture with a cut and a breaking in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for each type there is a specific remedy or treatment in restoring it, as will be a separate reminder in its proper place.
Clear sign of a bone fracture. And by this is a fracture of the bone known: it is the twisting of it, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and that of it when you press it with your hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the location, nor is it felt upon touching the bone with pressure, and the patient does not experience significant pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a twist or a small crack, therefore it is not necessary to manipulate that with your hand and with a total compression; instead, place upon it the medicines of which there is a reminder at the appropriate time, suited to the location; and allow it to be tightened by a subtle constriction.
And know that when the location is bent but not split in two or otherwise damaged, such that the entire part of its structure remains, then it is necessary for you, at once, to begin rectifying it, lest a hot abscess occurs there.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then heal it by any means you can, through gentleness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and healing of the soft tissues is easier than that of the bone on which damage has occurred.
And then strengthen it according to the subsequent remedy.
But if the bone is damaged, then an extension of the broken limb (whether the arm or the leg) is necessary, if it is a limb; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two ropes or with one rope and your hand.
And your position, in which you place the limb in its natural shape while the parts of the broken limb are extended, then demands that you return those additions to their places with skill and by any method you can.
And take care, with all your strength, that your treatment does not cause further pain or injury to the patient; and, with all your ability, ensure that you place one bone with its matching partner in the best possible position.
And it is fitting that at that time you carefully touch it with your hand, and if there is any other cause, correct it and set it straight to the extent of your ability.
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as some foolish doctors often cause abscesses or contractions in the limb through their treatment, as we have seen in their many instances of treatment.
The proper treatment for a quiet limb is what I am recommending; so that you understand that broken limbs vary in their smallness and largeness, and in the form of those.
And for those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and foot, and similar parts, then the wrapping should be of a soft, thin cloth.
However, for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, there should be a firm and strong wrapping, for the firm bandage connects the large limb and holds it tightly on all sides, so no gaps or spaces are present.
And then, begin, with proper alignment, placing a suitable bandage over the fracture site, using three or four wraps, depending on the limb's needs.  Hold the bandage firmly with your hand.
And now, move to the highest part of the fracture site, and hold the bandage less tightly than you did the fracture area. And now, gently loosen the wrapping around the fracture site little by little, until a considerable amount of the fracture site is free.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken area, and now move the wrapping towards the lower part of the fracture.  Your procedure should involve the tightness of the bandage and its loosening, as was described in the first wrapping above.
And then place linen or cloth between the wraps, if the fracture has a twist or irregularity; otherwise, do not place anything there.
Then place another bandage over this, and quickly secure these properly made wraps if there is no inflammation or painful swelling at the site.  If there is, place something that relieves the swelling and reduces the inflammation. Leave it on for a few days; then you tighten the bandages.
Let the splints be made from half-lengths of straight wood, and be skillfully formed; or from pinewood; or from palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this shape and this figure.
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to the size and smallness of the limb; and then tighten the splints with another bandage according to your initial tightening; and then tie it securely with a bandage, as described previously for tightening, and let the tightness be greatest over the fracture site itself; and the further away from the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and made of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen with some fools using twisted cords for their bandages, and that is a great mistake, as the tightening loses its uniformity.
Likewise, extremely thin threads are not suitable, for you will not be able to apply the desired tightening with them, and there should be at least a finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is irritated by the edges of the splints touching the affected areas, then place some soft material like linen or processed wool beneath them so that it does not cause him injury.
Sometimes the fracture is with a wound, and an accidental rupture occurs in the bone, and I will address that in the second chapter, in detail.
And know that not every broken limb should be splinted on the first day; this is because, when the injury is severe, you should not apply splints until after about 5 or 7 days, or even longer, depending on your judgment regarding the possibility of a painful abscess forming.
And this is the method of plasters used by the ancients for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A common method of plaster for fracture repair, suitable for many conditions, especially women and children, because it does not generate heat or cold: take powdered flour, specifically the middlings of flour, which are the parts that remain on the walls of the flour mill during the grinding process.
And prepare it in this way, but sift it with egg white, and make the mixture neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster for repairing fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  a recipe using asafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and wild chamomile root (all of these in equal amounts); myrrh and aloes (each in half the amount of the previous group); and aloes (twice the amount of the previous group).  All should be ground and sifted, mixed with rosewater or egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; and then use this plaster, as it is a good compound for repairing slightly broken bones and is beneficial for many people.
Another method of plaster beneficial for fractures and sprains:  a recipe using wild chamomile and white marshmallow root (each in an amount of 10 drams); myrrh and aloes (each in 5 drams); acacia (6 drams); and Armenian bole (20 drams).
All should be ground in a mortar with thorough grinding, sifted, mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and for pain, cracks, and fractures:  take wool, soak it in sour wine and cooked oil, and place it over the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of repair; it is good for suppurating wounds and expelling pain effectively.
Another method of plaster for a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; grind them together and make a plaster from them.
A concise method of plaster for bone fracture repair and for resolving remaining pus: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile flowers, violet flowers, and powdered elder; grind them all together and mix them with wine, if the affected limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then treat it with moistened coriander water or water and its use.
Another, stronger plaster for resolving stubborn pus, assisting in the repair of the limb: take marshmallow root, linseed, balms, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile;  all in equal parts. Grind them together and mix with willow water, or fresh water, or wine, depending on the limb's condition and the color's tone.
However, Hippocrates in his book does not say that it should be placed on a broken limb during repair, but rather a cerot (plaster) made from wax and oil, and not anything else; and recommends that it should be of medium thickness/consistency.
However, in Gaul, it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during repair, and the ingredients used for drying with a little warmth, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar things to those we have mentioned.
A plaster for injury and pain: take equal parts of crushed chickpeas, human skin (or bird skin), marshmallow root, and salt; grind and sift them, then mix to form a plaster.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain, and when it should be removed, depends on whether pain, swelling, or a fracture or dislocation is present. If none of these are present, you do not remove it for several days. And if there is severe pain, swelling, or inflammation at the site, then you should remove or loosen it immediately, and remove the plaster.
And take a clean cloth and a dampened piece of sea sponge, immerse it in lukewarm water, and use it to wash the area until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved. Then allow the limb to rest for an hour; afterward, place a piece of wool soaked in sour wine and oil or olive oil on the area, and bandage it for one night until you are certain the inflammation is gone and that a hot abscess has not formed and the limb's pain is gone.
And then repeat this subtle compression with a small plaster, and don't constrict it as tightly as the first time, and use it in that way until it is healed.
And if the abscess, soreness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared, and you no longer need a plaster and compression, then you repeat the process in the same way as you did at the beginning.
And if no condition of those we have mentioned occurs on the limb, do not remove the dressing for three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes it is left for twenty days, depending on the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh coagulates around it.
Then increase the compression more than in your initial compression, and increase the patient's food intake, according to the patient's recovery.
But if you find the fracture site already too dry and weakened, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.  Therefore, moisten it with warm water every time you remove the dressing, for three days.  Slightly loosen the compression, and through this action, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
However, what foolish bone setters do, restoring the limb fracture a second time when it was not properly restored initially, and is restored incorrectly, is an error in their practice, a great fear; and if this were correct, the Ancients in their books would have magnified it and would have operated in this way.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, which makes it more reasonable that it should not be done.
Second Chapter: Of fractures when occurring to the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow of a blunt object, and the blow crushes the entire bone down to the marrow, just as it does to a piece of wood, and because of this, this type is called comminuted; or the blunt object cuts a portion of the bone, and cuts the flesh around it, but does not pierce through to the back; and this type of fracture is called a simple, complete fracture.
And the severity of these two fractures is either great or small, and the fracture is either a crushing or a tearing; and the cause of this is a blow with a stone or a fall on a rock, and similar impacts.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the marrow beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two fractures is either great or small.
And a fracture is also one that is hidden within the bone, in the fine detail of small hairs, and because of this, this type is called a hairline fracture.
And a fracture is caused either by a fall or a blow with a stone or similar, which forces a portion of the bone inward, and occurs in a hollow area, just as happens to the ribs when struck, and is a separation of the bone parts inwards.
This is more likely to happen in the bones of young, moist bodies, such as the heads of children.
And for all these types of fractures, the pieces, are separated, like scattered stars. And I will return everything to its proper place.
And we recognize all these types of fracture by probing those areas and by examining them with probes and looking for signs of rotting flesh on top of them.
A fractured area is recognized because it is exposed on the bone, cleaned, and probed with a probe, for the fracture appears black.
However, in treating a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms, and if you see symptoms that signify imminent danger, such as vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, swelling and inflammation of the affected areas, and similar symptoms in more serious conditions, without a doubt, the patient is not going to recover.
And if you see symptoms that are not serious, you hope for recovery, then you begin the treatment.
This is because if the patient has come to you in the early stages of illness, especially during the winter months, then you must examine the bone's condition within fourteen days according to all the circumstances.
And if it is during the summer months, then you should try to set the bone within seven days, being careful that the tissue below the bone is not corrupted by the pannicle, and that the symptoms we have mentioned do not occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the membranes covering the brain, and is fragmented and crushed, then you must cut away the shattered and crushed parts, as I will explain to you.
And you must shave the head of the injured patient, and examine the bone according to the custom and method possible for you, following the nature of the injury, and being gentle with the patient.
And if you encounter a bone protruding, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you must treat it accordingly, filling the area with cloths soaked in warmed wine and oil, and letting the injury rest until the abscess subsides, and the blood flow stops; then begin working on resetting the bone and removing it.
And this will be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow scalpel, and this is its form: And then you apply another scalpel, a little further out than the first; and this is its form:
And then you apply another scalpel further out than the second one.
And it is necessary that you have several different scalpels, some wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others, and have sharpened edges at their ends, and are made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease in striking the scalpel so that you do not strike the head and damage it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to pierce around it before you apply the scalpels with the wedges, which are called non-deepening wedges.
And they are not called that (non-deepening wedges) because they do not penetrate the bone surface adjacent to the bone, because the wedge has a rounded end or edge on the part below the head of it, sharp like an edge or a small circle, which prevents it from sinking into and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate that you take a large number of these wedges, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have available in all the skull's bones, the ends of which are sharp, the length and shortness are according to the thickness of each bone.
And this is the way to use three types of wedges:  The method of piercing around the broken bone is to place the wedge on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then replace the wedge with another in a different location, and place that which is between all the holes to the amount of the thickness of the ray or around it.
And then, with scalpels, cut what is between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible in the end, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other tool, such as pliers and fine forceps.
And you must take great care that the scalpel does not touch anything in the skull.
And therefore, when you have encircled the bone and separated it from the skull if it is continuous with it, and you have extracted it, you must scrape and smooth the rough edges of the bone using another tool similar to a scalpel, but it must be finer and more delicate than the other scalpels.
And if any small and jagged pieces of bone remain, then remove them easily with one of your tools; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments, as we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is light, free from fear, which Gualia describes and praises greatly; and this is his teaching: It is necessary for you at the beginning to start uncovering the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until when you have uncovered that part and have placed under it the tip of this gentle and cheerful scalpel, of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the pointed part is on two sides along its length, in the manner as you see; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the skull with its pointed, cutting face on the bone.
Then strike the scalpel on one part with a small mallet until you cut the whole bone with ease as it is turned, and you are certain that the bone will not cause any accident that you fear in any way. And if the doctor were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he were asleep...
Then if any cause remains attached to the bone of the pannicol in some places of the bone, cut that from it with the lenticular end of the scalpel, and free it with ease, for it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the pannicol, and what is cut or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and subtle irregularities remain there, then you must scrape away that roughness and eradicate those irregularities with the fine razors you have prepared, in various sizes so that you can apply the most suitable ones to every area and the most correct ones according to where you are in your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And you must use in your scraping of the bone at first the widest of those razors, and then use the finest ones, and do not cease doing this successively until you reach the finest and most subtle of all of them.
But in each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer treatment according to what you observe for its repair.
And it is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And what we have written here applies to large fractures.
And if the skin is retracted when you expose the bone, then you must take a cloth equal to the size of the wound, soak it in heated oil, and place it over the wound's opening; then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and heated oil and place that over the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible so as not to press on the fractured area; and then apply a wide bandage, but not so tightly that it binds the wound too much.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of a hot abscess; then remove it and administer medicines that counter excessive dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour, ashes, and similar herbs.
And you should make a powder from these medicines, ground into a fine powder, and apply it to the wound; generally, administer any medicine that has the property of cleansing without being caustic.
And be careful, by virtue of your skill, that the wound remains clean in your treatment; avoid applying ointments or other things that would cause it to fester.  Do not allow virulent matter to accumulate, for when it gets to the skin surrounding the brain, it will corrupt and rot it, and this will bring about great harm to the patient.
And the fracture of the skull, if the bone is damaged, especially when the treatment is neglected and there is blackness on the surface,  and if you observe in the patient the symptoms we have described, know then that it is perilous without a doubt.
If the blackness is not from the wound itself, but from the medicine applied, and the medicine is causing this blackness, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rubbed olive oil, and with those, moisten a cloth, then place that over the fracture; and then treat it with appropriate healing spices until it heals.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of a broken nose.
Know that the nose is not broken in two pieces at once, usually, but just one sometimes, because there are two bones in it, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and thus it is not broken, but only abraded, twisted, and bent.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into their nose, and manipulate the fracture inwards with your index finger, and outwards with your thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this easily, and be careful that your action does not cause further pain to the patient.
And if the fracture is in the most important part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then a small, thickened end of a probe should be used.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then do similarly.
And strive for a restoration within the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then approximately on the seventh or tenth day you should provide rest for the inflamed area (or boil).
And insert a small piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or two small, thick pieces if the fracture is in two parts, the thickness of each filling the nasal opening.
And some of the ancient healers said that the pieces should be soaked in broth and changed daily, but I do not see this as necessary.  It is better that the cloth be soaked in a mixture of cooked egg white and powdered [ground] spice; and leave it in place until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of the pieces of cloth, a bird's feather wrapped in linen is inserted into the nose; this is done if the nasal fracture is severe and breathing is restricted.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do it this way, and if you wish, use the cloth pieces.
And if an abscess develops later, plaster the nose with a cerate, or with cotton soaked in sour wine and roasted oil, or with diachylon.
But if no hot abscess develops, then you should cover the external one with barley flour and powdered herbs mixed with egg white; then place linen strips over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
However, if the bones of the nose are fractured or broken into small pieces, then you should cut away the damaged areas and remove them with instruments appropriate for that; afterward, close the wound and heal it using things that promote flesh growth and healing, and with appropriate plasters.
And if a sore develops inside the nose, you should treat it with cloths and administer lead cannulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe whether the fracture is only slightly displaced and not broken in two but bent inward; in that case, its correction is simple.
And thus, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of the right hand; and push the protrusion of the fracture inward with ease, outward with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thereby gently repositioning it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply traction on both sides according to the straight line until its re-alignment is possible.
And if you encounter a displacement of teeth with fracture, then secure those you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; and then place a poultice on the broken jaw, and then place a folded cloth over it, and place a large, properly-made bandage, or a piece of cloth the length of the jaw, over that; and then tie it as you are prepared to bandage it and the application is appropriate, until it is not damaged.
And order the patient to use rest and tranquility, and provide him with easily digestible foods.
And if you estimate that the shape has been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen the bandage on the third day; and then rectify what has been altered, and plaster it with powdered lime, egg white, or flour of millet, after you have removed the poultice, and place a soft wool bandage over the plaster.
And then, when that plaster is attached and the bone position is not altered, leave it, and do not remove it until the fracture is healed and tightened; for often this fracture tightens within three weeks.
And if another time a purulent abscess occurs, then administer what we have often said in its treatment until it is healed, and the abscess is resolved.
And if the fracture is with a fragment, then consider whether it is a detached piece of bone or splinters; then you must carefully remove those splinters with what is appropriate for removing them from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should enlarge it with leeches according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, place one of the appropriate plasters on it and let it heal until it is cured.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Often the collarbone is fractured near the front side, close to the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is splintered, and its restoration is difficult; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
And the operation in this case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds and steadies the broken collarbone, and the other extends the shoulder towards that area.
Then gently hold the fracture with your fingers until the proper shape is achieved, and it is neither overly prominent nor concave.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, of a size appropriate to your needs; and extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until you have properly aligned the fracture.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone's extremity outward, because it has become caught, then the patient must be placed on their back, and you should place a cushion of moderate size on their muscles.
And the assistant should press on the patient's muscles below until the collarbone's bone, which is caught above, is elevated, and then you should realign the fracture and hold it in place with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone, and they are loose, then you should break them apart and remove those splinters easily.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then you should create an incision with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, after placing the tool that supports the collarbone beneath the collarbone; and this tool is made of wood or iron, of which this is the shape:
And it is similar to a scoop, of which this is the concave part; and its width should be according to what you need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
However, its length should be according to what is possible for you in the operation; it should have two ends just like a pair of pincers, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound that you have incised when you have extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are certain of a pus-filled swelling, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a pus-filled swelling, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the extent of the wound's incision.
And if a pus-filled swelling occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rubbed oil and wine, and place it over that.
And be sure that the splint does not move from the broken bone; and therefore, you must check the patient daily, and when you see the ligament has softened or the splint has already moved, then you must correct it and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's sleeping position on their neck, and place a small cushion under their armpit beneath their sleeping position for the night; so that with that, the patient's arm is raised from the side, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is elevated by the muscle; or the patient's arm is tied to their neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless there is a suppurating or pus-filled swelling at the site within twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the patient's skin is suitable for it, and adjust the tightening and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and solidified.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in 28 days, and sometimes in some men, it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is fractured in its lateral location, and it is not broken through, but only the margins.
And therefore, when the middle portion of it is fractured—and it is only known by touch—then, according to the appearance of the fracture, prepare it and reposition it according to its natural form by any means possible.
Then place powder of ground chalk mixed with egg white and linen bandages over the area; then place a folded cloth; and then place a thin wooden board—corresponding to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or a bit more—over it.
But if beneath the board there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that hollow with linen bandages, and then elevate the board to an even level.
And then bind it firmly with long strips, with appropriate constriction and firmness to the board, until it remains in place.
And check the bandage every day; and whenever it is loosened, bandage it again, and re-position the board if it has moved from its place.
And have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore, when this number of days is complete, then you remove the bandage, and you will know for sure if the injury is of the bones, where the connection is not feared or their separation.
And if you proceed from the site of the heavy and painful bone, and place a splint under it, then you cut over it, remove it, and do as we have said for the fracture of the clavicle, for the healing of an abscess if this occurs here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this is often serious; but its extremities are more often damaged and broken into fragments.
And the symptoms when the middle of the foot is broken are that it inclines inward to the parts within, causing great pain, and difficulty in breathing, coughing, and a severe feeling and vomiting of blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident, not hidden from the sense of touch.
And the restoration of it is that the patient be laid on their back, and a cushion be placed between their shoulders; and then press on their muscles, and adjust their sides with the hands on both sides, and be diligent in the operation and in the joining according to every possible and suitable manner, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then place a plaster and bandage over it, and place a thin sheet of willow or rush, or similar lightweight material, over that, and then wrap it in cloth; and then be diligent in binding it tightly around the broken bone so that it does not move; and sometimes bind it in a circular manner to the back, and firmly tie that with proper tightening; and constantly observe the bandage, and when softened, tighten it.
And if necessity arises due to loosening, or suppuration, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then you must undo it and remove the plaster and correct whatever occurred by the treatment; and then you reapply the plaster, if necessary, to the area; and apply the bandage until it heals.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of broken ribs.
Know that a fracture of the ribs occurs only in the thicker parts, which are the middle sections; and on their extremities and forward parts, injury occurs only by this, because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the senses through investigation with words.
And the restoration should be such that the fracture is aligned with the fingers in the best possible manner, until it is aligned as necessary, and then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with splints, if needed.
And if the rib fracture is towards the interior parts, then the patient experiences intense pain and a stabbing sensation, similar to the stabbing pain one with pleurisy experiences, and this is because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting of blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
And the ancients were ingenious in that regard with many inventions.
And of what they say:  it is necessary to withhold foods from the patient that engender inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and stretched, and the fracture is driven outwards.
But we would avoid this, for it is not a light cause to generate a hot abscess, if it doesn't occur; and if it already occurs, then it is helpful for that.
And some of them would say that it should be placed over a cupping glass and subsequently that it should suck with force; and it seems like a reasonable approach, but nonetheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the area due to its weakness.
And some of them would say:  it is necessary to cover the area with wool already soaked in warm oil, and place powders between the ribs until it is full, so that the dressing is tight when wrapped around the body in a circular fashion; and then the patient should be treated with pleurisy cures, both dietary and medicinal.
And if a severe cause afflicts the patient, whom it cannot withstand, and the bone pierces the membrane with a harmful puncture, we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to make an incision over the affected area, expose the fractured rib, and then place an instrument over it that will hold the fractured segment in place, the preparation for which is beforehand, and we will carefully cut the bone and remove it.
And then, we should join the two sides of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs, then you should mix powders in rubbed oil and apply it to the area, and the patient should be treated with whatever is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of a fractured vertebra of the back and neck.
Sometimes there is a fracture in the bones of the neck, and sometimes there is a wearing away of them, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if you find their muscles already softened, numb, dead, and cannot be moved, extended, or squeezed, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed, and in this condition it is fatal.
And if they are moved and feel pressure from your fingers and pricking, then know that the bone's marrow is saved and the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar symptoms in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider their feet.
Then, if you see that the feet are also softened, similar to what happens in the muscles, and when they lie on their backs, they experience involuntary movements and evacuations, and sometimes they are lying on their back and want to urinate but cannot, then know that it is fatal, and therefore do not bother with their treatment.
But if you do not observe any of those symptoms, the cause is better and less severe.
And the treatment for this is to apply a sedative to the inflamed abscess that you place over the affected vertebra, rubbed with oil or using crushed eggs; apply it to that spot several times a day until the inflamed abscess is soothed.
And then apply a comforting and stimulating plaster, and bind it tightly; and instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you observe signs of bone fracture or any other separated part, then it is necessary to dissect the area, and remove that bone; and then bring the two edges of the wound together, with sutures if it is a large wound; and then treat it with some flesh-inducing ointment until healed.
But if the back of the hip bone is fractured, and the hip socket is damaged, then you must insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and with the other hand, align the fractured bone as best as possible, using the correct anatomical alignment; and then apply a plaster and a bandage, if needed, and then secure it tightly.
And if you feel broken pieces within it, then you must excise those pieces, and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the [broken] width/breadth/span.
The bones of the hips are often fractured, and if they break, the fracture is usually only a separation at the extremities and they are cut lengthwise and deviate in different directions; and the patient experiences pain and a puncture-like sensation at the site, and the leg becomes numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, so that it is above the fracture, matching its shape.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you align it according to what is available to you, fitting it in until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or has already shifted to the lower parts, then you have the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of the fracture is ready for you. And then, when you have aligned it, place a plaster over it, and afterwards place a wooden or splint over that, and compress firmly so that you fear neither further piercing of the fracture nor movement of the splint.
And align the hollow with whatever fills it, until it holds the compression equally, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their sound side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension and restoration until the hot abscess is calmed, and apply what calms it as previously indicated; and then return to the restoration, and compress it as appropriate.
And if the bones are shattered or comminuted, then you set them.
Chapter 11.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the assisting bone.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a splint of medium thickness, according to this form:
And two ligaments be tied to its two ends, and it should then be suspended from a raised position.
And have the patient lie on a bed; then place the patient's broken arm on the splint until it reaches the point on the middle of the splint where the curve of the arm should be attached.
And then place some heavy object on top of that, or have the attendant extend it further downwards; then the doctor should hold the fracture with their hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper position.
The other method is that the patient be lying on their back and tie the arm to their neck with bandages; then command two attendants, one of whom holds what is above the fracture with their hands, and the other holds what is below it; and each of them should extend it towards their respective side.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tie a bandage on the fracture, and another bandage over that, and each of the two attendants should pull in their respective directions.
And if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the point and the other half below the fracture near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be placed over that area and over the elbow itself.
Apply this with ease and without effort; and then, once it is tied securely and properly applied, tighten it if there is no risk of a painful abscess forming.
However, if a painful abscess develops, then leave the tightening until the seventh day, and place some wool soaked in sour wine and crushed olive oil on it until the abscess subsides, and then tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a poultice on the fracture, then wrap a fresh cloth around the poultice; then support the arm with this aid, and place the patient's open hand on their own muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the support for the arm so that the arm is in the correct position, unless any aspect of the broken bone prevents this.
And then use splints.
And you should place the splint that is wider and stronger than the others over the fracture; and place the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the constriction which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your constriction over the fracture site is tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the constriction should be.
And therefore, adjust the placement of the splints and the constriction, as we have described, at the moment when you return the limb to its proper position, then do as follows.
And if you fear a suppurating abscess, then leave the constriction and splints on for seven days, as we have said.
And afterwards, consider the limb in all its parts for three days so that no swelling or inflammation occurs in the area; or the provision of food to the limb is prohibited to prevent excess from the constriction; and therefore, correct all this according to what we have stated.
But if you are confident that no cause for this will arise, then do not loosen the bandage until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands be on their stomach.
And place a full, wool-filled poultice on the affected area, and be mindful at all times of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or that the bandage is not loosened; therefore, rectify all of this with your skill.
And provide the patient with food according to the order we previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until the strengthening has started; and then you must increase the amount of food for them.
Because it is customary for the poultice and the leg to be strengthened in 40 days; and then they must be loosened, a bath administered, and medicated with ointments that rectify that.
And if the fracture is badly bruised, then you do not loosen the bandages and splints for a day or up to two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones; of which one is small, and it is the one that sits beside the aforementioned wrist, and the other is large and is the one located beneath the smaller one, in the lower part.
And frequently the larger forearm bone is broken alone, or the smaller one, and frequently both are broken together.
And when the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the bone of it is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the physician, to ensure its restoration, that a small extension is placed with ease until it is healed.
But if the larger bone is what is broken, then it is necessary that a more forceful extension be applied.
And if both bones are broken together, then it is necessary that you apply the constriction much more forcefully.
And it is necessary that you apply the form of the hand to ensure its restoration and the extension of it, placed on a cushion, with the palm of the hand on the upper parts, higher than all the other parts mentioned, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient lie on a smooth, hard bed.
And there should be a cushion in front of him, at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer further distress.
And then one attendant extends the lower arm with their hand or a bandage, and another attendant extends the upper arm similarly.
And then the physician manipulates the bone until it is returned to the best possible position.
And if there are fractures in the bone, then you must use your skill to reduce every fragment to its proper place.
And if a separated fracture appears in the bone that is causing a disruption and is not amenable to your restorative efforts, then you should operate on it, and remove it using the method previously described.
But if the fracture is with pus, I have already made a separate chapter on this, and therefore take care of it accordingly.
And if you encounter an abscess at the beginning of your restoration, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of warmed oil and white wax, which should be moderate in its thickness and subtlety, and firmly wrap the cloth around it until the abscess subsides; then remove the plaster and apply a prepared poultice of ground powder mixed with egg white, then place a bandage; and let the bandage that is placed on that pus-filled fracture be firm and strong.
And know that the name of the bandages for the arm is given in the major cases, that is, a fracture in one or two segments.
Then apply your bandage to the fracture area firmly and forcefully, and if the bandage is applied to the areas above the fracture or to the areas below, apply the bandage slightly more loosely in accordance with the previous instructions in the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is wrapped should be of a medium thickness, neither too subtle nor too coarse, just as we have described.
And consider the limb and its ligaments for a few days. And if any cause arises requiring correction, such as swelling occurring on the limb, then you should soak the limb in warm water until the swelling subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, then reapply the bandage.
And if the bandage has already softened, and the bone has already healed and resembles those around it, then correct all of this with your skill.
And further consider if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage, because then you must loosen it slightly and leave it for several days until nourishment flows to the limb, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes we have mentioned, then it should not be loosened until approximately 20 days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by its power of active movement, and let him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 or 32 days, or more quickly in 28 days, and all of this is according to the disposition of the humours and the strength of the healing.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that the wrist and the joints of the fingers are frequently fractured, and not only by impact but often by friction.
And when the hand is fractured or injured by friction, then the patient must be laid down, and a bandage should be applied to the area evenly, and then the patient's hand should be placed on that bandage.
Then the attendant extends the broken bones, and the physician binds them together until they are properly rejoined.
And then a poultice and a bandage should be applied, otherwise an abscess may form; and then a splint is placed over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
However, if the fracture is in the parts within the palm of the hand, then make a bandage shaped like a sphere of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with their fractured palm; then it should be bound with a long bandage.
And let the splint be of leather with cloth in which it is supported, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and bind that as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a splint over it and another splint on the inner part of the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the binding, just as the hand is wrapped around the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as necessary and then bound with the palm; and if you want, put a small, straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the pinky finger, then it should be bandaged and tied with the adjacent finger; or all the fingers should be tied together in sequence, and that is better; or place a small splint over it, as we said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and subsequently, the disposition of a hot abscess and its opposition – with your operation – with what is necessary when any of these causes occur, according to how the narration of it has been repeated.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often fractured and declared to be broken according to how it has been displaced forward and most severely.
And the restoration of it is done so that a ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament below the fracture, and the patient is laid prone on their belly and on their face.
And then the attendant stretches the whole ligament to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then let the ligament be close to the knee, towards the hip joint, so that the extension lies on top of it, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is near the knee, then let the ligament be placed close to the knee, and the extension be towards the lower parts.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both their hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is joined with a good union; then it is necessary to apply a poultice and a bandage, lest the limb be afflicted by an abscess. But if an abscess occurs, then you leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this: you must wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, folding it two or three times and removing any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the splint extend from the highest point of both parts. Then, wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place splints on the thigh, over the fracture site, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is stabilized.
And then begin with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture site, with three or four wraps.  The further you move away from the fracture site with your bandage, the weaker, lighter, and more loose it should become.
And then extend the two ends of the splint downwards until they reach the ankle, and firmly hold the ends of the splints on the other side to ensure the bandage stays in place.
And then leave the bandage on it, ensuring that no swelling, abscess, or inflammation or similar issues occur to the limb; and if any of these occur, then remove the bandage and correct the problem immediately, as we have often stated.
But if there is a protruding piece of bone, then you should reposition it as best as possible.  If not, cover it and leave it, and treat the area with what preceded the remedy until it is healed.
And sometimes this thigh fracture, or whatever is similar, is held together by splints, as we have said in the section on the arm.
However, in the repair of the limb done in such a way, the patient does not experience lameness; and if it is repaired alone, or another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the affected limb remains lame for a while.
And know that the thigh is splinted for 40 days, or a little more, or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of the constitutions and other predispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the repair of a fractured kneecap.
Know that a fractured kneecap often heals, but it frequently causes a lot of attrition (wear and tear/damage).
However, if it is a fracture, it is merely a fissure or hole in its parts, with or without inflammation, and everything has happened according to the patient's feeling.
And its repair is to unite what has been broken with the aforementioned means until it is joined together as much as possible, through alignment, ease, and construction.
Then apply a poultice and place a round bandage over it, if necessary; and bind tightly with a suitable bandage.
And now consider all the methods we have described for other fractures, such as an abscess and similar conditions,  in order to oppose any accident with what is suitable for the patient until healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is slender, and is called the shinbone.
And the treatment for some types of leg fractures is similar to that for arm fractures, and therefore the restoration is done in the same way, and the procedure is similar.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is completely dislocated.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is dislocated forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it below, and it is one of those things that is not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, reduction, and ligation of the splints accordingly.
However, if the fracture of the leg is extensive with many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and alleviate it with your skill/virtue.
And if the leg requires an operation similar to that on the arm, and when you have adjusted the splints and completed your operation, then you should take pieces of willow wood, placed underneath the parts that are placed on cushions, and these should be made of palm branches, thin ones, not thick ones, and their length should be in proportion to the length of the leg, from the ankle to the bottom of the foot.
And then wrap each part in two layers of cloth according to its length, and place one on the leg on one side and the other on the other side, from the ankle to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places: at the two ends and the middle.  By this arrangement, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a proper position.
And now a small wooden brace, the length of the leg, has been placed on it, to prevent movement of the leg.
And this is especially necessary for fractures, and when it is properly called a fracture.
And thereafter, examine the leg daily and carefully monitor it for any abscesses, inflammation, or other similar issues. If any such problems arise, apply appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the ankle and bones of the foot and toes.
Fractures of the ankle itself are not common; however, fractures of the foot bones occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes are rare, and they are usually only bruised or injured during a disruption of position.
And if the bones of the foot are fractured, and sometimes those bones are displaced from their proper positions, then the patient should place their foot on the ground in a way that is prepared as if they were walking.
Then place one foot on whatever is elevating those bones, and then press down, and press and squeeze them until they return to their proper places.
And then apply a plaster and bandage on top, and place a small table underneath the sole of the foot with two flat, wide ends on it.
Then bind that tightly with a downward-stretching bandage, after you have wrapped it in cloths and other things as you need.
And after three or four days have passed, then you untie the bandage, for you will find the bones squeezed together, or broken, or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if any bones are broken, then restore them, and fit them together just as I have shown you and recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and slightly wider than it; and underneath the foot place this table, which I have already described to you, and bind it with a downward-stretching bandage.
But if the broken bones are two, three, or more, then you place a splint on each finger, of its own size, wrapped in linen; and bind the board at the lowest part of the foot, and let one end of the board be placed over the belly of the foot so that it is well supported.
And it is important for you not to forget that you should consider all the things which I have described to you in the other fractures and accidents that we have discussed; and be prepared for any accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the thigh bone, the hip bone, and the penis of the male.
When the thigh bone is fractured, then make a splint in the shape of a curved cylinder, and then incline it slightly towards the back, and let it be held behind.
Then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it is placed on the thigh like a bandage; and then the woman should be comforted, and slowly raise her buttocks, because all of this is for the fractured area to return to the alignment of the thigh bone, and the broken bone to return to its proper place.
And then place pillows under her back, and when she wants to urinate, the wool comes out easily and she urinates; and you reduce and return it in the manner in which you originally fixed it, and then return to her original pillow.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and insert a reed cannula into the wound; then put the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated within the thigh, for the fracture will return.
And then it should be filled with wool and left for several days as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and setting what we have recounted for the hip bone.
And that which is proper is not hidden in these nearby fractures which heal slowly, especially for him who studies and uses and understands these words of my book; for that fracture signifies to you in the most effective ways the correct procedure in its restoration and reduction; thus understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take a bird's nest and place it over the penis; then place a cloth bandage over it, wrap it up, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when they are with a plague.
It is convenient for one who has suffered a fracture with a plague, and especially if the bone is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the upper arm, or similar to them, that you apply cupping and bloodletting as soon as the conditions for bloodletting indicate it, as we have mentioned above.
And if the plague flows blood, then you should apply cupping to contain it, in such a way that you powder it with crushed brick, if no other cause is present.
And then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this, unless an abscess arises.
However, if a serious abscess arises, then you leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days, for you will cause harm.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then you must carefully reduce it and secure it with your hands with ease and minimal force.
However, if the force of your hands is not sufficient to align it, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight inches, and its width depends on the size of the injury; and therefore, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, depending on the need for the treatment of any fracture.
And it should be round, and have little thickness so that it is not doubled under the pressure during the operation.
And it should have a sharp tip, with a bevel on its edges; and the top should be thickened, tapering down from the middle to the ends.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", which means a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sharp end of it be raised above the prominent end of the bone.
And you push that in one go until the bone returns, and it is secured with some bandage.
And therefore, strive to bind the broken ends of the fracture together; and if the broken end is small, and does not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument has the power to do so.
However, if you cannot completely reduce the bone with what we have recounted, then cut it with whatever surgical instruments are appropriate for it, or saw it with a saw in any way that is possible for you.
And then remove any roughness or small splinters that remain in the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and shortly after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and then do what you deem best to greatly benefit the patient.
When your bone restoration is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and especially if it's summer, and do not apply a plaster or anything containing oil to the wound, for this will cause suppuration and corruption.
And then administer styptics at the time of your completion of the bone restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you cut the wound with scissors and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to compress the wound with the fracture, for many foolish doctors have done this, and caused death or a consuming illness, or festering sores, to their patients. And if your fracture is slight, soft, different from the severity of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or severe, and you fear any of the bad accidents we have described, and you find pain in the area, then you should not apply styptics, but make a dressing of hard cloths instead of styptics and bind it tightly.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to fester, you remove the cloth you had placed over it with wine, and then administer poultices,  medicaments commonly used to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon and similar remedies.
And you must loosen the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is healed and closed.  The limb should be prepared in such a way that the blood flow runs freely to the lower parts.
If the wound persists for many days and is neither healed nor has the pus been drained, then know that there are hidden dangers, and you must probe the wound with a probe. And of those dangers, those that can be separated, remove and extract them. Those that cannot be separated and cause pain to the limb, force you to cut them, if possible.
And if you find pus or ichor, signs of corruption or putrefaction, then you must apply a remedy appropriate to that, as described in the relevant chapter on its treatment.
And concerning this, where my discourse and your expertise are needed: when a large bone is fractured, treat it as you would a fractured thigh bone or similar fractures of large limb bones. Do not attempt to pull or extract it, for often death results. Leave it undisturbed until it can knit together, as in roughly 20 to 30 days it will mend on its own; then treat the wound if it appears necessary, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of inflammation that occurs at the site of any fracture.
Often this inflammation occurs at the site of healing from a fracture, especially if it is near a joint, and it disfigures the shape of the limb; it greatly hinders the limb's natural function.
Then consider if the inflammation is recent, and apply medicines that have a styptic effect, such as alum, vinegar, myrrh, cerussa, and similar substances; use some or all of these, mixed with styptic wine, egg white, or vinegar, and place this mixture on the inflammation over a bandage, firmly bandaging it.
And leave the bandage in place for several days without loosening it; then remove it and apply another, until the inflammation is gone; or apply a lead poultice directly to it, as lead has the property of reducing swelling in the limbs.
However, if the inflammation has hardened and become a festering sore, and it is necessary to remove it forcefully, then cut into it from the deepest part, and excise the excess or scrape it away with some raspatory until it is removed; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored, and subsequently the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural state.
When a broken bone is set, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this is due to several causes: one is that the ligaments were not properly tied and bound; or due to excessive tightness of the ligaments hindering nutrient flow to the limb; or due to excessive application of remedies; or due to inappropriate movement; or due to a lack of blood in the patient's body, and their general weakness.
And the treatment for this is to give the patient nourishment and to make their body gentle until the blood is replenished; and administer baths; and introduce joy and cheerfulness.
And afterward, place a poultice on the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water compresses, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and the operation is not performed as it should be.
When, after the limb has been repaired, a deformity, prominence, or knot appears on the broken bone, and this affects the limb's shape, but nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural operation, then you should not accept the word of anyone who claims that the limb has been broken again.
But there have been many foolish doctors and bone setters who have done this in our land, and this practice is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
However, if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which softening herbs are soaked, such as the leaves of marshmallow and its roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and a softening poultice should be made, such as well-prepared diachylon; or a mucilage of marshmallow root should be made, mixed with a dove's fat or with cedar oil, and applied as a poultice; or fatty figs should be crushed with pigeon dung, and similar medicines known as consolidants.
And sometimes it is dissolved by diligent, gentle friction with moist hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in all directions at all hours.
However, if the deformity has progressed and become strong, hardened, and difficult to treat, then it is necessary to cease the pus, and the bone's continuity should be resolved.  That which is superfluous or swollen on the bone itself should be incised with fine incisions, and the process should be managed with care and effort.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place, thereby hindering movement and distorting the shape of the limb, causing significant pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when an accident causes dislocation, it is necessary to immediately attempt reduction, and delay is not advisable, for if delayed, the area becomes inflamed and firmly bound, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And therefore, it is not advisable to move or stretch the affected area during inflammation, for it often causes spasms and prolonged pain.
But when this occurs, you should attend to the patient's inflamed area, and let it rest until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and the dislocation should be reduced easily.
And every limb is cured by this, so that the displaced part returns to its proper place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation, following the precedent for fractures; from the highest part of the body down to the lowest.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
So that the two jaws are dislocated if not promptly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their positions and slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated and fully dislocated, until they are softened at the joint, such that the patient is drooling and cannot hold or close their mouth, and the patient's tongue is swollen.
However, when the dislocation is slight, it often returns on its own with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then a gentle reduction of it must be administered, and it must not be delayed at all.
And the minister must hold the patient's head, and the physician must insert the index finger of one hand into the site of the jaw dislocation within the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of their hands should be outside, holding and steadying it; and the physician commands the patient to close their jaw and to move each part to and fro; and the physician straightens the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply a vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And thus, when they are returned and are straightened, and the patient's mouth is closed and not swollen, then place over them powders of cloth with a plaster, and it should be made from beeswax and oil rubbed together; and then it should be bound with soft bandages easily.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and let their head be placed between two pillows, so that it does not tilt to the right or left side; and do not force them to chew anything; let their food be soft, until when the pains are gone and the jaws are healed, then let them eat whatever they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not force the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, and breathing, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often fevers and persistent sweating occur, and the patient's abdomen is easily agitated, and easily vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and often the person who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated from the inside by its connection with the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And the restoration is that the patient lie on their back and extend their arms. And then firmly press the area with your palm, for it will return.
And then place a poultice and powders on that area and compress it.
However, the extremity of the one that is sitting on the elbow and that continues with it, is not dislocated in any day; therefore, it must be reduced and bound according to what we have said and according to what is appropriate for you.
And then apply a poultice, powders, and a bandage to it, and instruct the patient to adhere to quietness and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated in only one way, but in three, one of which is that it is dislocated from the top part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated from the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated behind, towards the shoulder; nor is it dislocated in front, towards the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and comes out from the lower parts towards the top, and especially in those with little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those with a lot of flesh, it is expelled with difficulty.
And often accidents befall some men through blows or falls, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and is swollen because it is already dislocated.
Therefore, you must examine this until you are completely sure of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts near the neck; so that you distinguish between the dislocated and healthy muscle, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find a hollow at the head of the muscle, and below the neck, towards the contact of the head of the muscle, just like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor to any other movement.
If it is dislocated towards the foot or upwards, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And a slight reduction of this dislocation is done when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the attendant raises the patient's hand to the upper parts; and then places your fingers under the patient's neck, and raises the joint with force back to its place, and the attendant raises the patient's hand, and extends it upward; and then places it down, so that it returns easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a significant time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient should be bathed in warm water and a poultice should be administered that softens and smooths, like if it were concoctions of rose root, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and should be administered.
And then the patient should be placed on their back, with a wool pad placed under their neck, that is neither too loose nor too tight, and then the doctor places their heel on the pad, and raises the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's hand to prevent it from being moved downward, and another attendant holds the patient's head, preventing it from being moved downward, so that it will quickly return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: you have a man present who is taller than the patient, standing on the affected side, and place their arm under the patient's neck and raise the neck upward until the patient is suspended in the air, and another attendant pulls the patient's hand from below their stomach. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with the patient, to weigh it down, so that the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced by another method: a long wooden post, round at the top like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is placed under the patient.  Then, thick blankets are placed on top of the post's head, and the patient is positioned along the length of the post, and then the patient's hand is extended downward on one side, and the patient's body is pulled forcefully to the opposite side, so the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult by all the methods we have described, then use this treatment: take a post that is the length of two arms and a width of four fingers, and its thickness should be lightened to the level of the neck in this way:
And on the round head, thick cloths should be tied so that the post does not injure the patient.
And then place the post under the patient's armpit, and extend the hand or arm down the post, and tie the post to the armpit, arm, and hand's extremity.
Then the arm should be placed on a ladder-like support, the width of which is appropriate, and the hand extended downwards, and the other side of the body should be pulled to the other side, so that the joint will enter quickly.
And when its insertion is complete, according to whatever way is possible for you, then place a layer of wool under the armpit; and then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder with vinegar and egg white over the entire muscle, just as it is wrapped around; and then tightly bandage under the armpit, and the bandage should be wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hand should be tied to their neck, and left undisturbed, and the hand should not be moved for seven days.
And the patient's food should be restricted, until the limb is strengthened, for this is more conducive to its healing.
And subsequently, the food should be increased, after seven or five [days], and movement should be encouraged; and if it is then firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is repeatedly dislocated due to humidity affecting it or another cause, then a cautery with three openings should be applied, as previously described in the chapter on cauteries.
And if all this is done, and after seven days the bandage and joint are loosened, and the plaster and bandage are reapplied several times, and it is still not fixed, and the arm cannot be raised to its normal position, then know that the nerves, which are at the end of the muscle, are severed or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be properly placed back in its socket.
For dislocations of the foot and nipple or posterior parts, reduction is performed by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.
And another bandage should be applied to that area, and treat it until it is healed.
And if after healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original natural state.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of elbow dislocations.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and mostly in the front to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident from the pressure or from the touch, depending on what figure it is dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated elbow with your hand, this is clearly evident to you, for the joint is recessed and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its muscle.
And you should act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes severely inflamed, for if it becomes severely inflamed, its reduction is difficult, and the limb is not completely healed; and especially when it is in the back parts, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and causes more pain, and often results in death.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's hand is extended with two hands, and the patient's arm is extended, and the physician's hands are on the elbow, and below it, and he presses the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the heel of his palm until it returns to its place.
However, if the dislocation is in the front parts, then it returns easily by bending the hand with his hand, until he strikes the elbow with the heel of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous extension and strong force.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and hold that extension so that it is not withdrawn from the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, since it is wrapped in a doubled cloth long over his hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that those things which aid in the lubrication of the joint will be done with ease; and then press the joint with forceful pressure until it returns.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that it be placed on a poultice in which there is astringency and binding with egg white, and be bound with a descending bandage, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and left for several days.
And then it should be unbound; and therefore if the joint is formed in its place, then you untie the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then you repeat the poultice and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is tightened; and then unbind it.
But if it happens that there is great difficulty during the reduction of the joint, and the condition is moving, then administer moistening baths and gentle friction and pressure, until it is relieved; or place a soothing poultice over the joint, perhaps a fatty substance; and then bandage it and leave it over the wound day and night. And then remove that, and put it in a bath; and when it is soaked, then you rub the joint with moderate friction, and then repeat the soothing poultice, perhaps a warmed substance, one time, and a second, and a third, with intervals of bathing, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place over the wound a warm, damp cow's hide, and press firmly on it; and do this several times, for this is moist and will restore it to its proper position.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the arm, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocation of the arm sometimes occurs, and the reduction of its dislocation is relatively easy, unlike other joints. However, speed is essential in reducing it at the time of the dislocation, before the area becomes suppurated or a harmful abscess develops.
And the reduction of its dislocation is done by placing the patient's hand joint on a table, while an assistant extends the hand, and the physician places their hand or palm on the area of the joint, pressing until it returns to its proper place.
However, it's necessary to consider if the palm has already moved to the back of the hand. If so, the patient should place the back of their hand on a table in front of the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the patient's hand should be positioned on the table, so that the physician's hand can be placed over the joint area.
And so if it returns quickly, it's good; but if not, then gently restrain it with a bandage to prevent an abscess, and leave it.  Do not repeat this, for otherwise it will not tolerate nor will it be possible to complete the reduction after a few days have passed.
However, if the joint remains in its twisted position, and the patient feels no pain, but only that the hand is weakened and cannot grip anything, then you should know that the nerves are severed or bruised.  In this case, there is no remedy other than to cauterize the area near the injury, applying heat in order to alleviate the problem.
Therefore, once the injury has been reduced, apply the bandage we previously described and leave it on and fastened for five days; then, it should be untied and left, and the patient's hand should be exercised.
But if the movement is hindered and some heaviness occurs, then alleviate it with warm water and some rubbing several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various ways.
And when any of these fingers are dislocated towards the palm side or the back of the hand, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your fingers until it returns to its place.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend it over the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is properly aligned in its socket.
And when night comes, bind it according to that narrative, and do not cease to unbind and exercise it with movement during the day, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is straight.
And do likewise if it is dislocated towards the back of the hand, and bind it to that part and do your initial procedure on it, until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the spine.
When an accident causes a complete dislocation of any of the vertebrae of the spine or neck, and the affected vertebrae remain significantly displaced from their proper positions, then in that case there is no cure, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's urination is involuntary, and they cannot control it; and often, some of the patient's limbs or both legs or both arms, or one of them, are paralyzed, or a vertebra is displaced from its place; for often one is displaced, and the removal of such is often done in four parts.
Therefore, when it has been displaced to the rear parts, it is called a posterior dislocation.
But the treatment of this is that you must consider if the posterior dislocation occurred from childhood, for in that case there is no cure or complete recovery.
However, for those caused by accident or impact or similar incidents, the Ancients described various methods of treatment in lengthy accounts, of which the most useful return; but I will summarize that, omitting the excessive detail, for the sake of brevity in my explanation and exposition.  I have prepared this using various instruments, by means of which I will demonstrate and explain it.
And only those dislocations that occur in the back, specifically as I describe, can be cured.
And the patient should be laid on their face, close to a wall, and something soft should be placed beneath them, so that their foot is not injured.
And then a straight pole should be placed, inserted into the ground near the patient's head, and another pole similarly placed near their feet, at the other end of the raised surface.
And one attendant should hold the pole, and it shouldn't be anchored in the ground; and another attendant should hold the other pole in the same manner.
And then wrap a bandage around the patient's head, and underneath their temples securely; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole near the patient's head, and tie it there; and then tightly bind the other bandage around their hips, their buttocks, and down their legs; and finally adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole near their feet.
And now each attendant should extend the bandage to the part of the pole, and the two poles and bandages should not be moved from the positions in which they are placed, but still not fixed as we have described.
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with strength until it returns to its place, or should place a table upon it, and then carefully adjust the patient's feet onto the table until they return to a normal position.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a table whose width or length is approximately three arms' lengths, and hollow out a space in the wall, which we mentioned is near the patient, where the end of the table can be placed. And then place half of the table on the spine, and the physician places his feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its proper position.
And if you wish, open with the wheel that is turned by hand; and you place in the ground, at the patient's head, two poles, each one arm's length long, and at the patient's feet, also two poles; and the space between each pole is one palm wide.  Each pole has a hole through which the wheel turns, and each is firmly fixed to the ground so it does not move.
And a round post, on which the wheel is mounted, is placed in the two holes of the two poles.
And at the end of this post (the one with the wheel) is a hole into which the post is fitted, the length of which is a palm's width including what is turned around; and the other two poles have a similar arrangement.
And now tighten the bandages you have placed on the patient's feet around the hole near their head, and the bandages on their thighs around the wheel near their feet.
And near each wheel, there should be an attendant who turns the wheel with their hand, while the physician adjusts the spine as we have described.
And after the spine has been repositioned and the area is aligned, you must apply a dry poultice made with egg white and then some cloth; then place over the poultice a piece of wooden board whose width is roughly three fingers and whose length covers the affected area of the joint, and over this board place the spine.
And now it should be bound with the bandage we have mentioned, and the patient should use subtle nourishment until they are healed.
And if any lingering inflammation remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then medicines must be administered which soften and soothe with prolonged application of the plate, as we have described; and a lead plate is to be applied to that area.
And sometimes inflammation occurs in the lower part of the spinal column, caused by that dislocation.  That bone, if inflamed, is not to be treated with this medicine, because forcing it will cause you to incur death.
Chapter 31.
Of the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the joint of the muscle can only be dislocated, and the problems affecting them are not like those affecting other joints with minor displacement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and less so forwards or backwards.
A sign of the hip's dislocation inwards is that when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot toward the groin, and the area where the groin would be is inflamed with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh bone has likely migrated there.
And the sign of dislocation outwards is that the symptoms are the opposite of this inwards dislocation.
The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient can extend their leg fully, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if they try to move it forward, they cannot; and the patient's urine is retained, and the groin is swollen, and the patient walks on the outside of their foot.
The sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, nor can the patient bend the knee forward to touch the groin, and the patient's leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is soft, and the head of the thigh bone is towards that area.
However, the reduction of these types of dislocations is that you must consider, at that time, if the dislocation is old and chronic, and has already been present for a time.  If you attempt to reduce it then you should expect only partial success; and, therefore, no presumption of complete healing should be made in this case.
But in the case of a recent dislocation, one of the four types, then you should try to return the joint to its proper position, extending it both inwards and outwards, and moving it to the right and left, because it will easily return and needs no further treatment.
However, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare strong assistants and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either by using their own hands, or by using a bandage tied to the leg above the knee; and another assistant should hold the patient's hand above so that they place their hands beneath the patient's armpits; and then hold tightly with a strong bandage over the root of the thigh, and let a third assistant hold the other end of the bandage.
And this extension should be either from the inside of the knee to the groin, or from the back to the buttock.
And this extension should be done all at once until the patient is raised off the ground by their body weight and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is a common procedure for all four types.
And so, if the dislocation returns with what we have described, it is good; and if not, then for every type, it is necessary to proceed to the specific treatment.
In the specific reduction of a dislocation, when the dislocation is inward, the patient should be laid on their healthy side; then apply bandages around the thigh's root, in the area between the thigh's head and the space below the groin; and then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the highest part of the pubic bone.
And then another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, and firmly hold the affected thigh's large part and extend it outward forcefully, for this forceful extension will return it to its proper place.
And this type is easier to treat, with which this limb is reduced than the other types.
But if you are hesitant and do not obey the entire procedure with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to tie the patient's two feet together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each be about four fingers, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by about two fingers.
And then let the patient be suspended over the head of the bed, and let them be in the house; and let their distance from the ground be about two arms' length.
And then command a strong young man to grasp the top of the thigh, and let another young man support the patient, and the other young man, pressing the thigh with strength, will propel it, so that the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, the patient should lie on their back, as we have described in the previous mention of the flexed knee.  The bandage should be tightened tightly around the affected leg and the patient's feet.
And then two staffs should be placed, one at their feet, and the other at their head; and then staffs fitted together in the middle of the hill should be placed, wrapped with damp cloths, so the patient isn't harmed because the staff is between their thighs, so that the extension towards the lower parts isn't pulled.
And then each attendant should extend in their respective direction, and the physician with their hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be slightly extended, and it is according to this same method on a hill; and the physician places the palm of their right hand on the injured limb, and then grasps it with the other hand, and with that grasping, positions the extended part towards the lower part of the affected area.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downwards, and they are elevated from the ground; instead, they should be placed on a hard surface, as is appropriate for the repositioning if the leg is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about the patient lying on two supports; and they should be on their face, and the ligaments extended, as we have said, not very long.
And pressure should be applied with a board over the area where the joint is.
Therefore, when the repositioning is complete—and the sign of its completion is clear to you, which is that you extend the patient's legs, and when you see them equal and the patient tightens their leg and stretches it without hesitation, then know that the limb has been correctly returned—and then you close the thighs and apply a bandage, and bind tightly so that the leg is not moved in any direction; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then loosen the bandage and compare one leg with the other.
Now, if you see them equal in appearance, then know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then let the patient be.
And if you see any cause of softening, then you reposition and bandage it, and bind it as you did initially, and leave it for three days.
And then loosen it, and have the patient walk slowly for several days, until they are better.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, and backwards; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of a dislocated knee is that you tell the patient to apply their leg to their thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these ways is that you have the patient lie down straight, so that they extend their leg, if possible; place your arm on their side, and put their foot between your feet; and then apply your palms to their knee, and hold them between your fingers firmly on their knee, and another assistant extends their foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that their leg adheres to their thigh with effortless ease.
And then bandage that and adhere the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days, until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is not possible for you, then administer strong extension with the ligaments, which in the treatment of the hip were previously discussed.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle is sometimes displaced by a small movement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and its dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for a slight displacement is a gentle return, and it is that it be extended easily with the hands and held until it returns to its place.
However, in the treatment of a complete dislocation, it is necessary to have the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and capable assistant on the back of the patient, in the middle of the affected area.
And then, you, with your right hand, take hold of the foot at the highest point, and with your left hand, the lower part of the foot, at the location of the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand, twice, and then extend with the left hand; and push the foot of the leg with the right hand towards the leg without difficulty.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the foot of the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two attempts according to this method, and if you see the foot swelling, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation, for it (the foot) returns.
But if you are prohibited from reducing it with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly fix a thick plank on the ground, and place it between the patient's thighs, and you have already covered them with a cloth so as not to harm the patient.
And then the minister of the patient should hold the patient's thighs, and another minister should extend the leg with their hands or with a bandage tied to the back of the leg; and each minister should extend against the extension of their partner, and the plank should be placed between the patient's thighs to hold it, so that the body is not pulled down toward its extension.
And then the physician grasps the dislocation with their hands, and another minister holds the healthy thigh from below, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And thus, when the dislocation returns and the success of the reduction is clear, then apply a plaster and firmly bind it with bandages, and bandage the foot to the leg.
And it is necessary to be careful of the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage placed there is not forceful and harms them severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage has softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the patient from movement for forty days. But if forced to move before that period, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted, and subsequently will not receive a cure.
And if a boil happens, then it is necessary that you apply to it the treatment described in our earlier discussion, a different location for care and application, until it is gone.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the toes of the feet.
It is necessary that the dislocated part be gently manipulated without effort; and this is not difficult, rather easy.
However, if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot, then it is necessary to make the patient place their foot on a soft, level surface, like the ground or a table, and to be positioned as if walking.
And then you stand, placing your foot over the area where the joints are affected.  Then firmly press down on the affected area with your foot, until it returns to its proper place and you see it is now aligned, and no longer appears to be out of position.
Then place a board beneath the sole of the foot that encompasses the entire foot, having two ends.  Secure it with appropriate and firm bandages for three days; then loosen the bandages and allow rest from walking for several days, until the area is fully healed and the restoration is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that occur with a bruise, or a fracture, or both together.
When any of these causes occur, and you exert yourself excessively in the treatment and restoration of the patient, death often results.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for anyone to presume to treat such a patient, but only one who is knowledgeable in the art, experienced, compassionate, and patient, not hasty or presumptuous.  In the beginning, let them only use remedies that reduce intense inflammation, and leave the patient to divine judgment, only hoping for a return to health and a lessening of the illness, if there appears any hope at all. Then, strive to perform the reduction as soon as possible, before the inflammation becomes severe.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that reduces inflammation and treats the bruise with appropriate desiccant ointments.
And if a dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must treat the separation, and do in this regard what we have described in the simple ailments of similar cases previously mentioned.
And, according to your ability, avoid harm to the internal organs by following the instructions I have given you; for this is best for you before your Creator, most lasting for your glory, and most healthful for your body in your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, may God be blessed by them. Amen.
