On the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation.
Afterwards, have the patient lie on his back and on his side;
After, lift the core that is inside the areola with the fingers of your left hand;
And if the joint is dislocated inwards, then heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which here is the shape:
and cauterize the core until it pierces through to the rib, and the shape of the cautery would come to resemble four cauteries;
and for this reason, cauterization is done with the cautery that has three nerves, which is why the shapes of the cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are as thin as a probe and this is the shape of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes another nerve is added to this, which makes eight cauteries.
Afterward, apply crushed leeks with salt onto the cautery;
afterwards, let the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated from above, which rarely happens, then cauterize on the thick part of the clavicle cautery, with many cauterizations by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
