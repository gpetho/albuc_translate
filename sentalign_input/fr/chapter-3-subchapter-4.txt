of the fracture of the jaw
When the jaw is broken below, and there is no wound outside, and the fracture is only external, and it is not broken into two, only curved inside, it is easily recognized.
If the fracture is on the right side, you must place your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, place your index finger of the right hand, and gently align the fracture inside, and adjust it with the other hand from outside, and set it evenly.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated into two, you must apply traction from both sides, until it is even.
And if the teeth are dislodged, or broken, bind them with a thread of gold or silver or silk, then place wax on the broken jaw, and apply a double cloth; and place on the cloth a large, well-made splint, or a piece of leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it as best you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see the alignment change, untie it on the third day, and then reset what has changed; and apply a poultice, made of mill dust with plenty of eggs or sesame flour, after you have removed the wax; and place light wool on the poultice, and if the poultice adheres, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess occurs, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, check if any piece of bone is missing; if so, carefully remove it with suitable instruments.
And if the wound is narrow, enlarge it with a flame according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is large, and apply a suitable poultice to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
