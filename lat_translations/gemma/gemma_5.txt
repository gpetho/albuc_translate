Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished with you, my son, this book, which is the latest work of science in medicine, alongside the completion of my own, I have reached the end of it through its exposition and declarations. It seemed to me that it would be useful to complete it with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand is a matter of our region and our time, and since its science has been abandoned for a long time: until perhaps its science has perished, and its sign has been abolished: and nothing remains of it except for brief descriptions in the ancient books, which have been altered by the hand: and there has arisen from this both error and hesitation, until its intentions have been closed and its desire has been prolonged: I have seen that it is necessary to restore life to it with the ordination of this treatise in this way, according to its position and declaration, and its abbreviation: and that we should come to know the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the operation, with the addition of their declaration and their preparation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, because a good surgeon of the hand is not to be found in our time: because the art of medicine is long, and the author must be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy as Galen has narrated, until he knows the movements of the members, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, lacerations, and their number, and their emergence, and the pulse of veins, and quietness, and the exits of places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And thus Hippocrates said, that the name is much, and the work is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken of this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Forasmuch as he who is ignorant is not skilled in the things which we have spoken of concerning anatomy, he will not avoid falling into error, for he will be among those who interfere with men: as I have seen many of them who form opinions of these things without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	For indeed I saw a stolid physician who followed the swelling of a scrofula in a woman's throat and cut some arteries in her throat: whereupon the blood of the woman flowed until she died between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a bladder which was in a state of inflammation, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So it came to pass that he extracted it along with the remnants of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Because the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself was called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who took charge of a certain Duke of our land concerning medicine: and it happened that a black slave who was with him fractured his leg near the heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, bound up the fracture with nails and pins, and did not permit the wound to drain.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	And he died according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him for a few days, and forbade him from tying up the ligament: and he remained thus until the swelling of his leg and foot had gone down, and for the loss of his leg and foot, and he came to his end
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him again: and I advised him to loosen the ligament: and there was peace, and he was freed from his pains
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Truly, corruption had been confirmed in the limb: and I am unable to restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	The corruption has ceased its progress in the limb, until it passes away
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And behold, another physician who performed an incision upon a cancerous tumor: and it became ulcerated after days, until its malice grew great with its master himself.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	For when cancer is pure and proceeds from melancholy humor, then it does not suffice to keep it at bay with all the iron in the world, except in the limb which can tolerate it, that it may be excised entire
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of this, O Son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: the one which is associated with health, and the one which carries risk in many conditions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	I have been stirred in every place in this book in which an operation is mentioned, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	For you must be cautious of this, and humble yourself: that you may not find fault with anyone, and be dishonest
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore measure with humility and care, and the sick with facility and firmness, and use the better means for healing, giving thanks to God for the success and praiseworthy outcome: and banish terrifying anxieties that make fear dwell in your heart, that there may be confidence in your spirit and comfort in your soul.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains a great glory to your credit, and a sublimity in this world, and finally in the number of your souls.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Indeed, Galen has said in some of his instructions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You do not cure a bad sickness: do not give it a bad name
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I am therefore divided into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning the use of the Cautery with fire, and the Cautery with acute medicine, the Chapter, arranged from head to foot, deals with the forms of instruments and materials for the Cautery operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and packing, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar procedures, the Chapter is arranged concerning the forms of instruments
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, dislocation, and treatment of torsions, and similar procedures, the Chapter is arranged concerning the forms of instruments from head to foot
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God.

Pars I.	Part I
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the application of the Cautery, and the preparation of the wound: in what complexions it is suitable, and at what time: whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we proceed with any operation, we must mention the quality of the instruments and materials to be used: and in what complexions this should be displayed
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, that the discourse concerning the quality of the Cautery instrument, and its preparation, is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and secret discourse.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many learned men have spoken of this, and they disagree among themselves: and indeed little is to be learned from their discourses, fearing the prolongation of the subject
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the Cauterium is universally applicable to all complexions, whether with matter or without matter: except for two complexions which are a hot complexion without matter and a dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In hot and dry complexions with matter, the Cauterium is dispersed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that the Cauterium is useless in these (complexions).
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Others have said the opposite, that the Cauterium is not suitable for an abscess, which is caused by heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat. And it is unsuitable to heal an abscess with heat and dryness, along with heat and dryness
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	He also says that by the Cauterium is made an application in all heat and dry abscesses that occur in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man and moisten it, with the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I also say, by his sermon, that I have learned from experience the same thing.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	It is true that one should not approach this matter rashly, without having been tested, and having exercised in the last exercise of the Cauterium, and having recognized the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of abscesses in themselves, and the causes of these, and the accidents of these, and the time space of these.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Except for these complexions, there is no fear of them: and especially in cold and wet abscesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	I have observed that all doctors agree on this: and they do not disagree in applying the Cauterium in these (complexions).
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And behold, the sons say that from the secret of the curing of fire with the Cauterium, and the goodness of the Cauterium with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm any other connected part with it, except for slight damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of inflammation extends to that which lengthens from the limb: and it may cause an accident in the limb, producing an illness difficult to heal, and may even cause death.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not make this [inflammation] happen, unless it be excessive.</start_of_turn>
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	I have learned from experience, by the length of service and study with art, and by observation of things: and for this reason I excuse myself from the length of the discourse.</start_of_turn>
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it be not [within the scope of this book], because it is not permitted for this book of mine, I will nevertheless confess to you a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies of its expulsion, which expels diseases with a philosophical demonstration that agrees with the minds of the wise.</start_of_turn
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	Note that the wise men also dissent in the time when it is permitted to make a cautery, and they say that it is better to delay the operation.</start_of_turn
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	I also say that a cautery is useful at all times: for in the meantime the document [ie. the wound] is covered over with moisture, which is attracted by the cautery.</start_of_turn
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Above all, if the cautery is for necessary and painful wounds, strong, fast, which do not tolerate delay: for in that case they fear the evil which results from the delay, which is greater than the little harm done by the wound in the meantime.</start_of_turn
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	Do not listen to the minds of the vulgar or stupid doctors, who do not understand that an inflammation which is healed by a cautery does not always return: for they put this down as a consequence, but this is not the case: for a cautery is not, except in the place of medicine, which changes the complexion and dries up humours which are the cause of pain.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	The burn surpasses the medicine in swiftness of its action, in its skill of operation, and in its confidence: and it is possible that the disease will vanish at some later time according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the disease, and its skill; and what is prepared in his body from the collection of superabundances in him: and what comes to him from food, and like things from the wound, except in the case of a disease in which the burn is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A mild disease in a limb with few superabundances, and moisture, like the burn of a tooth, because of pain, and things like these, is possible that it will not return in it after that pain
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this is in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	Indeed, in this matter the saying is true that the burn is later than the medicine: for they believe that there is no cure which can be compared with medicine, neither with anything else after the use of the burn.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is contrary to that: for the intention is not that the burn should be later than the medicine, except when we administer modes of treatment for some disease and do not confer them with the medicine: then we finally administer the burn, and it confers: thus the burn is later than the medicine, not according to the intention which the vulgar people and many learned physicians understand
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that the burn is better with gold than with iron: and they did not say that except for the equality of the gold and the fineness of its substance: for they said that it does not make pus at the place of the burn
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	This is not absolutely true: for I myself have seen that in some bodies it does not make it in any other way.</start_of_turn>
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	The cautery is good with itself, and better than with iron, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	When you ignite the cautery with fire from gold, do not be afraid, when you ignite it according to its quantity, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the flesh, and if you add more fire to it, it will melt in the fire and turn into flakes.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the craftsman departs from that with this job: and because of this the cautery with iron is faster and closer to us, from its straightness to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have also set out this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters: and I have set out from the head to the feet: so that they may learn what they wish from this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	How to cauterize the head in the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here is the cautery of the lord of humidity and cold upon the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and of the flux of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of the multitude of sleep, and of toothache, and of throat pain: and generally of all ailments that happen from cold, such as palsy, and sweat, and seizures, and apoplexy, and things like these from ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cautery is to apply the cautery to the patient immediately: to evacuate first with a soothing medicine the head for three or four nights, according to the nature of the patient, his age, and his habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make a mark on his head with his finger
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that you can place your hands on his chest
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of your nose between your eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	When your middle finger touches the mark, it indicates that the area is scorched.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then ignite the Cauterium Olive: this is its shape
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked area with the burn, and with gradual tension, the hand will retract itself.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly and look at the place
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that the amount of bone or cartilage or herbs is escaping, then lift your hand again
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the process with the burn, or with another burn if it has cooled: until you see the bone, which I have told you of
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it, and apply it to the place: and keep it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then apply butter soaked in the liquid to the place, and cover the burn with a clean dressing, until the burn is healed by the fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents containing tetrapharmacon, until it is healed
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have said that the more the wound remains open, the more pus it emits: which is better and more healing.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	Some people say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and keep the Cauterium until something of the thickness of bone has hardened
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then remove what has been cauterized from the bone, then care for it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	Others say that the burn should be continued until the bone is clearly marked, so that the bone will fall out as if from a burn of a woman's ring: or an instrument which women use to pierce the alphabet with a small letter: and they say that from this place vapor escapes which makes the head swell, and let the wound be open for a long time
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then he cares until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	Neither of two species of cautery is to be used on anyone except in some cases according to the temper of the patient.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And dismiss it [the cautery] quickly, for it is better with me for the health of the patient.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head grows weaker from the continuity of its natural solution: as we have seen in other parts of the body: and especially when the head of the sick person is weak of its nature: for the first species of cautery is most safe and better with me than the other, and it is useful: to work therefore with it in health
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	In this way the cautery is to be used for the pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head [Chapter] III.</start_of_turn>
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head there occurs a chronic pain that prolongs in the sick person, and there is used hyssop, and saffron, and alum, and oil, and application of these things
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has been cauterized with one cautery, which we have mentioned, and you do not add anything to it: then consider it
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is strong of its creation nature, and is not weak, and has found fever or heat: then cauterize with another cautery under that little one.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over every horn of its head with the cautery, without piercing the skin, and uncover the quantity of bone from which we have spoken.</start_of_turn
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it once with the cautery in the occiput of its head, in the place which is called the vault: and that is the place where the marrow is put: and elevate your hand in this and do not uncover the bone.</start_of_turn
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The sick man complains of that pain which is causing him distress, and diverse from the pain of other head wounds.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	I say concerning this wound: it is a cauterium which is performed in its place. It must be that the horn of the head and the back of the head are cauterized by a finer cauterium, and the middle part of the head by a greater cauterium.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	In the case of a hemicranium, whether with drugs or with the instrument.</start_of_turn
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When in the part of the head there is a pain and swelling, or when the pain extends as far as the eye, and it is driven out with physicians who apply compresses to the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I have said in the treatise on diseases, and it does not suffice: then the cauterization in this case is performed in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with a burning instrument.</start_of_turn
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization with acute burning medicine is like this: you take a tooth from another person and burn it, and you apply it to the wound.</start_of_turn
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then you split the place of the pain in time with a wide incision, until there is in that place under the skin where the tooth has been caught.</start_of_turn
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it into that place under the skin until it is hidden: then close over it with a bandage of fine silk, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then take it out, and wash the wound with oil for two or three days. Afterwards put over it a wet bandage soaked in butter, until the place has healed. Then care for it with an unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	Even if one does it like some doctors who burn with them, as I wrote in the twelfth tractate on physicians who endure.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Burning like this is indeed according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cautery, which has this shape.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	It is called Clauis: for its head has the shape of a key, in which something curved is, and in the middle of its head there is a small prominence
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the place and hold your hand: and gradually move the iron back and forth: and let the quantity which burns from the thickness of the skin be like half of it
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burnt, and the blood flow is not increased
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the wound in salt water, and place it over the place, and leave it for three days: then put the wound with butter: afterwards take care with oil until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if necessary, burn this half of the cranium with the second extremity of the cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	Burn from the incision of the artery in this half of the cranium, not the old way directly
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	In the old way, the cautery was done in the half of the cranium directly
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a headache, when that which we mentioned in the preceding discourse and which we mentioned in the enumeration of diseases has not been helpful: and when you have used up the treatment which we mentioned from the cautery with the physician, or the cautery with fire, then you must burn the cautery with a knife until it turns white when you place it on the place of the pain with a line whose length is half of a finger, or as much as that: and hold your hand firmly so that you do not cut the artery, and pull it until you reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	It is necessary to cauterize the jaw, lest it should endure from the movement of the jaw during mastication, and cause the lateral surface or the nerve which moves it to spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	Take heed also of the guarding of the blood vessel which has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its severance there is peril, especially for him who is ignorant of its work and is careless and inexperienced: and he abandons the operation immediately upon doing it the first time
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with the reminder of the method of the treatment of the flux of blood which is from the artery mentioned in this book of mine.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If indeed the wound is of such kind that it will not suffice with this cautery, and if the body of the patient bears the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, take care of the wound, until it is healed
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you will, administer the cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery which has two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For the cautery is better and more secure than the ligature of the artery
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing in the pain of the ears.
Caput VI.	(The text continues with the next section of the translation.)
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When there is pain in the ear from cold, and it is treated with solutions, and the rest of the treatment which we mentioned previously, and the pain does not vanish, then you must cauterize: and that is called the Punctum, which has this shape
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then you must cauterize the surrounding area of the whole ear, as it is twisted: or around both sides, if there is pain on both sides
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And prolong thee with the Cauterium from the root of the ear downwards, after you have signed the place with the cautery: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in every ear, and as much as that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	And then care for the place until it heals
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	So as to cauterize in the Tortura
Caput VII.	Chapter VII
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture which is cured by cautery is not except of those which happen from phlegmas, as we said in the discourse of the diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And you must cauterize the species which happen from swelling, and the spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you have cured this species of torture with wine, and purging-pills, and gargling, and the cure does not suffice, then you must cauterize the patient with three Cauteriums: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the earlobe, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your Cautery on the side opposite the diseased part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For the softening does not happen except in the part which appears healthy
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cautery is that you cauterize the Cautery itself at the tip of the upper ear under the earlobe slightly: and the other at the temple. And the length of each is as long as the thumb
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the Cautery until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is consumed
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the Cautery, and it is of a knife whose form is as aforesaid: but it is not more acute than that of a knife for oil. And it must be a knife of moderate thickness
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place, until it is healed.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary to proceed with care in the dressing of the head with wool and with what we have already mentioned.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then bind the head of the patient: afterwards cauterize the middle of the head, and the cauterize over every horn of the head, and over the back of the head, and three times over the joints of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, you are unable to endure the heat of the cautery in the treatment of the body in its entirety, and the patient is tolerant, and the inflammation is severe: then cauterize four times over the joints of the back, and the last one with the greatest heat, until the greatest part of the tissue is consumed, and lift your hand up
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for yourself until you are healed: and let the Cauterium be applied according to its form, as has been stated beforehand.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy
Caput XI.	Chapter XI
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	The epileptic is not cauterized, except for that from which the epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore to dress the brain of him in the first place with wool, and with the rest of the treatment which we have mentioned: when the patient is great or is tolerant of the medicines
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If, however, he is a child, who does not tolerate the medicines: then is administered gargling and nourishing foods for the brain, before these many days with the improvement of the nourishment of the body
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then burn the head, afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, as it has gone before: and cauterize with another cautery in the nape of the neck, and over all the hair of the head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient be strong and endure pain, then cauterize it with cauteries, as has been said in the case of paralysis, and the softening of the body over the cervical and dorsal vertebrae: and let the cautery be olive oil as before.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If the patient be a child, then apply the cautery gently, as in this manner.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is excess of slippery humors which lead to melancholy, and the body of the patient be moist, then give him something which will temper his brain, as has been said in the treatise on reduction: then burn the head of the patient, and afterwards make a paste from saffron, as a circle.</start_of_turn

Then cauterize it over two temples with two cautery instruments, if there is an incipient descent of water in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side, if there is an incipient descent of water in one eye only: and cut off with the cautery all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and make the cautery marks long in the width of the temples: and burn from the flow of blood.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, they are sticky: and they are over one, and the arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that these are from excessive cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cautery which I have narrated at the beginning of the descent of water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over two temporal bones, and two cauteries in the cartilage under two bones
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if digestion is not sufficient, then cauterize itself everywhere around the eye, over the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

When you are treating this, when that which we have said in the explanation has not taken effect: then cleanse, and give in the patient's mouth barley-bread three times a night: then burn its head, and cauterize it with the middle cautery, with an olive cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if necessary, cauterize above the two upper eyelashes with two small cauteries in every part: and prolong for two times: and let the length of every cautery be according to the length of the eyelash: and do not touch your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity which is to be cured of the third eyelid.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	As for the manner of cauterizing the Palpebra when the hair of the eyebrows is burnt by the inflammation of the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	There are two kinds of cautery: either with fire or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in the cautery with fire, it is recommended to put the patient before the fire, so that he may expel his hair, if there are any that are falling out, until they are prolonged and equal
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they are pricked at the root of their hair: then tighten the eyes with the thumb and the index finger, so that they do not move, until they are healed
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are healed and equal, then place the head of the patient in your lap: then sign over the Palpebra of the eye with charcoal, in the manner of the figure of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hair
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a soaked bandage over the eye: or in hairgum on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then burn the cautery, whose form is this
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then burn over the figure, as you have marked gradually in many bodies, until the surface of the skin is consumed, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, throughout its appearance.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	The sign of the completion of your work is: if you strike the eyeball with your thumb and pull out the hair at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Lift up your hand then: and let it go in three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place upon it Butter with the Buttock, until the Eschar is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with Unguent, until it is healed
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If some hair remains after an hour, and the Palpebra is softened: then repeat the Cauterium over the place, as you did at the beginning.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If they are in the lower part: then burn the place until they rise to their natural place: and make them equal so that they do not prick the eye
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	In the same way as when burning with a medicinal Cautery in this case.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	Just as with the principal diseases, you must let the hair go, until it becomes long and equal
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from parchment in the shape of a myrtle leaf
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from Soap which is well pounded, and from Chalk which has not drunk from anything of its weight an ounce I or almost as much: then mix these together with a good contortion, and make it with a bit of friction, so that it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take from this Pande a piece as thick as the leaf of the myrtle which you made, and put it upon the eyeball of one, or of two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	Place under the eye a soaked cushion in albumin, and let the patient's head rest in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	Place your finger upon the medicine and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	Move it whenever the patient feels the bite of the medicine: for its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While you are doing this, you will have discovered its bite: then withdraw the medicine and move it with your finger
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the bite has subsided, then withdraw the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	Consider then, if the eyelid is swollen, like swelling with fire or incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat the application of the medicine in the place where the medicine did not cause damage, until your operation is completed and the eye is closed
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it a cushion with butter, until the skin of the wound is separated from the underlying tissue
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment or other things until it is healed
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary that you take care of the last care, that nothing of the medicine should fall into the eye
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid is softened after a few days, and some hair has grown in the eye, then repeat the application of the medicine in the place where the eyelid softens itself, as you did at the beginning.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	This is the form of the myrtle leaf
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	Know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and shape
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore be attentive to this: and do not neglect the rightness of this work which is the study of this art
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On how to cauterize in the Lacrimal Fistula.
Caput XIX.	On how to cauterize the Lacrimal Fistula.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you have treated the fistula, when it has not yielded to your treatment: then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Direct the patient to place his head on your lap, and keep his head minister between your hands in such a way that it does not move or be disturbed with his head
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the cautery stick soaked in alum or in the hair-powder over his eye: then apply the Cautery, which is of this shape
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Make a cavity as wide as the shape of a twig of a feather at its widest point, with the Cautery: if it should penetrate to the other side, or if it should go upwards, do so cautiously
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	It is better to make the cavity wider.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it up: and if it is not open, then open it up and remove its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place over the fistula the Cautery which has been made hot
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And keep your hand close to the Cautery from the eye towards the nose, so that your hand does not slip, or cause discomfort to the patient: and place the Cautery on the fat of the eye, and burn it through
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you do this at the beginning of the Cautery, it will be good
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	If not: then repeat the Cautery once or twice if necessary: and keep it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place the cotton with butter and care for it with an unguent until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If after forty days it has not healed, then place above it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and then dress it according to what is written in its chapter
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And thus is another way of cauterizing the fistula, which some have said before.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct it to the place of the fistula and find it: then place under the opening of the fistula a soft cushion, that is, a bandage of soft wool, of such a form
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of lead which is equal to a drachma in liquid form, and hold your hand with a good bandage, and do not move the patient in any way, so that it does not run, or that the liquid lead should not reach his eye
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to place over the eye of the patient cotton soaked in albumin or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a remarkable healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, with what we have said of cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and reduce the fistula to the curve of the nose, according to what is written in its own place
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	About the cauterization of fissures of the lips.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times there occur fissures in the lip, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When you have cured them of these fissures, when the cure has not taken effect, then you must burn slightly with a small knife, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its shape be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then put the flame quickly into the cuts, until the cautery reaches the depth of the cuts.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the cautery, until it is healed.

When there is swelling in the root of the tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus forms, and the tissue ruptures: afterwards it becomes firm, and pus comes out, and a fistula forms: then you must care for it, and do not be sparing in the treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize according to the quantity that has escaped through the fistula.</start_of_turn>

Then ignite the cautery, whose shape will emerge afterwards, so that you may place the cannula over the tooth: and introduce the cautery into it quickly; and keep your hand steady, until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand up: then repeat the cautery a few more times, as you wish.</start_of_turn>

¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	In this way the cautery is done for a toothache.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.</start_of_turn>
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is due to cold, or if there is cold or worms in it, and no relief is found with the doctors: then the cautery is done in two ways: either with butter or with fire.</start_of_turn
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery with butter is done as follows: take a piece of butter the size of a barleycorn and put it into the crucible.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take the cautery and place it over the tip of the tooth.</start_of_turn
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the butter which is boiling: and place it over the painful tooth quickly; and keep it there until it cools down: then repeat it a few more times, until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	Or if you wish, immerse a wool or a piece of cotton in cold butter, and place it over the painful tooth: and put on a piece of burning iron above it, until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.</start_of_turn
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery of it with fire is useful, in order to reach the air tube or the iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of bulk in its body, so that the heat of the fire does not reach the diseased bone
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then the cautery is applied, whose form will be as follows: place it upon the tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery is cold.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this cautiously, for the pain will vanish, or in the same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it must be impressed upon the burn of the cautery, so that the diseased bone will be filled with good marrow, and hold it for an hour: then expel it.

When the veins are swollen with phlegm, and by cold humours, and do not obey digestion by medicines, and you wish to expedite their digestion: then make the cautery concave, whose form is as follows:
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that the smoke of the cautery may escape from the other extremity: place the flame upon the heel once, and then again if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the lesion
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the lesion is small: then apply the cautery according to the size of the lesion.

When the gum becomes soft over the alveolus of the teeth, and especially when that exists with the coldness of complexion, then it is necessary to evacuate the sickly one first with the physicians' solutions
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize in the neighborhood of the root of the tooth in the depressed place: and burn, so that you do not burn the tooth itself, nor the gum, except for what is necessary.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.

When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until it is expelled from its composition, and the carbuncles multiply at it, and constant methods of treatment are not sufficient: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, extend his limbs, and clench his hands
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then burn with three cautery instruments: a needle cautery of the size of a single digit under the breastbone, and two lower cautery instruments from the two lower flanks of the single cautery, until the triangular figure of the burns is completed

When it happens in the Epate that there is pain from cold and moisture, or from great swelling, until it comes out from its natural configuration through excessive evacuation, and the sick person is cared for as we have said, and not otherwise: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed upon his belly, and that three cauteries be made above the Ep like this figure and in the same quantity as below the hypocundri, where the cubit of a man reaches: and let there be space between every cauterization according to the width of a finger: and let the cauterization be according to the length of the rectum of the body: and do not press your hand too much with the cauterization
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of the first be that which is absorbed from the thickness of the skin, the middle quantity not being added: and let the sick person be standing on his feet
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has extended his limbs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible that these cauteries be made with a surgical knife, when there is skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care that you do not go too far with the cauterization, and that the thickness of the whole skin is not overheated, because the body is heated throughout, and comes to the intestines: for the skin is thin there, as you know well
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	How to cauterize the spleen wound.

When an incision occurs, and one wishes to write, if the wound is in the liver itself, or in its tunica: if it is in the liver itself, there is blunt pain without sharpness: and if it is in the tunica of the liver, with sharp pain existing: then the physician must be fatigued from his care of the patient.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	The patient must therefore rest over his wound
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the wound is placed with the cautery: then the cautery is applied which readily absorbs the radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with one cautery until the entire skin is consumed, and has passed to the fat, until the whole wound is evacuated: then care for the wound itself until it is healed
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And do not let anyone use such a cautery except one who has studied the art of medicine for a long time: and by whose hand these diseases have often been cured: for he alone will dare to perform such an operation
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	Or let me send her away, for it is better with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	How to cauterize in the pleura.
Caput XXXI.	How to cauterize in the pleura
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients say that a cautery with roots of aristolochia is applied to the cold pleura according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you take from the dry roots of aristolochia some long pieces, one of which is as thick as the breadth of a finger
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse the wound in fat: and raise it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then burn with a cautery one at that place which is between the continuation of the curve with the collar, and with two small cauteries under guidance slightly depressed at the part which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that place which is between the fifth and sixth ribs depressed slightly backwards: and a cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one at that place which is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from both sides of the chest, the lower cautery which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you should press your hand with the cautery, but that it should smell freely from the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient men say that there are some people who use a cautery like iron: they burn and throw it into that place which is between the ribs, until it is consumed with that to the very end, and comes out whole: as we said concerning the spleen.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the sick man will immediately die, or that a fistula will happen in the place which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	In this way burn the spleen head only as we have said.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating a wound of the spleen, when with that which we have said concerning the treatment of diseases, and it does not confer healing, then burn in that the three ways which are all straight forward
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is to make three cauteries, or four in a line following the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of the spleen which precedes this figure
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And be between every cauterium the quantity of the breadth of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And be the quantity of the cauterium as we have said in the cauterization of the liver, equal
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cauterium: and let the patient lie relaxed above his back
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another manner of cauterization is: as when you have two rings of cauterium, as we have said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus: and elevate the skin which is over the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient is: and elevate your hand as much as you elevate the skin according to the breadth of the body, so that the cauteria may fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two rings of fire downwards until when the fire has pierced the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cauterium: there will remain four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cauterium which has three rings.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the cauterium after you have put it away to emit pus for many days: for thus will it be more beneficial than any other thing which has preceded it in the treatment
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	In the treatment of Hydrops
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterium does not fall in Hydrops, except as it is properly grasped.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating Hydrops with the methods of treatment which we have mentioned in the chapter on wound-healing, and the cure does not suffice, then it is necessary that you cauterize the four corners of the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back between the ribs, and one in the breast and one under the stomach: and let the quantity of the depth of the cauterization be equal to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then withdraw the open cautery, so that it emits pus over a long period.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	Do not abandon the patient from treatment after the cautery: for it is necessary that two intentions should be joined together for healing to occur. It will hasten towards healing with the aid of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the inside is cauterized is a claw: as it has been before. And that with which the back is cauterized is an olive: as it has been before
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the cauterization of the feet and legs:
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIIII.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When the swelling has subsided in the Hydroponicum, and the skin has become citrine: it is necessary to cauterize over the back of the foot between the cubical and great toes. Place your hand over the cautery and do not twist it: then lift your hand and do not move it altogether
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The skin will then become citrine again, and the cautery should be of this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make over each ankle two cauteries at the lower part of the limb: and perform the cautery with the tip of the cautery: and perform the cautery along the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below it, around the middle of the limb: and over every heel make two cauteries: and withdraw the open cautery without treatment for a long period: so that some water may remain from it. Then care for the limb as we have said before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the cauterization in the solution of the belly
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly is cold and humid, until it has lost its power of retaining and digesting, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with the methods of treatment, and not by nature: and give the patient strength that he can tolerate the excessive virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as it is done in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel, with a claw cautery below the ribs, and a large cautery over the spleen, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	If the moist humors are excessive, and the patient tolerates it, then burn the affected parts with the cautery over the belly and over the whole of the intestines: and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the great one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	There is indeed a valuable cure which does not err in its effects.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Method of cautery for haemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the rectum are many old haemorrhoids, or one, and are of gross humours, cold or corrupted by moisture, and are cured by this which we have mentioned in the discourse, and not by treatment: then burn three cauteries over the lower spin of the back under the almond-shaped piece triangularly, and a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is hardened, and his food does not digest, and that his face is covered with fluid after eating, then burn him over the stomach with a large cautery, as we have said before: and a cautery over the spleen and another over the liver, with a cautery of the navel: and remove the open cautery at a convenient time: then care for him until he is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Method of cautery for the almond after its excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you have excised the almond, then burn a cautery which absorbs the heat
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning cautery into the excised almond: and your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many almonds, then burn each one according to what we have narrated
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for it until it heals, when it has received what is necessary from the unguents.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a great cautery over the ulcer, that is the last thing in treatment
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	In this way cauterize the fistula in the rectum.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the section and the work we narrate in its place, and returns from it, perhaps he will heal with cautery
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When this happens to any fistula, and it becomes old, pus comes out of it, and it moistens the corrupted parts.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is necessary to test it with a subtle touch
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the quantity of its depth with the touch
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then burn the cautery, which is like a ray
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then enter yourself with the burning into the fistula and the quantity in which the clamp has entered
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery over it until all the corrupt parts are consumed, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And take care that you do not burn the nerves, if there are any, or the veins: or if the fistula comes close to the outer body, or to the inner organs, then take care to be away from all these places
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	Do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think that it is not penetrating
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and material is detached from it, and remains so for a long time: then you know that it has healed completely
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	If they do not cut away from it the material, then you know that it is penetrating, or that there is a fractured bone in its depth, or as if from these it is excised.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	In the event that they do not excise it from that material, then you know that it is penetrating, or that there is a fractured bone in its depth, or as if from these it is excised.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the kidneys that there is pain from cold, or from large swellings, and that it is diminishing because of this the thing which is causing the infirmity, then it is necessary to cauterize over the whole of the kidney and over the navel of the kidney, with a cautery that has preceded the recollection of the matter.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we must cauterize it a second time in the same cavity.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines come together.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore there are two remaining lines.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Chapter XL
Caput XL.	When it happens in the bladder that there is pain from cold, or from large swellings, and that it is diminishing because of this the thing which is causing the infirmity, then it is necessary to cauterize over the whole of the bladder and over the navel of the bladder, with a cautery that has preceded the recollection of the matter.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When the bladder suffers from disease and swelling from bile and moisture until the patient is unable to retain urine, then cauterize the lower part of the belly above the bladder where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and from the left side of it: and let the length of the cauterization on each side be according to the quantity of the thumb node. And cauterize the lower back, or two cauterizations if necessary.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	When the bladder suffers from disease and swelling from bile and moisture until the patient is unable to retain urine, then cauterize the lower belly above the bladder where the hair of the testicles begins, from the right side and the left side of the belly. The length of the cauterization on each side should be as long as the thumb. Cauterize the lower back or twice if necessary.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When the uterus suffers from cold and moisture and is hindered by that from conception, and its menses are corrupted, and its discharge is delayed, and there is pain in its neighbourhood, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we said concerning the bladder, and cauterize the lower abdomen, or two cauterizations: and let the cauterization be as long as the thumb.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Chapter 42.
Caput XLII.	When the testicles are dislocated, and the pain is great, then cauterize the lower belly above the bladder where the hair of the testicles begins, from the right side and the left side of the belly. The length of the cauterization on each side should be as long as the thumb. Cauterize the lower back or twice if necessary.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture of the mucous membrane flows down to the testicles and causes them to be expelled from their place: and the sign of this is that one knee hangs over the other knee when they are compared with each other, and the place of dislocation is found in that crease
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the patient above the testicles with a cauterization of the same size as a circle: after which one should mark the sign of the cauterization around the testicles, as is done with a ring: and let the testicles fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of such a shape as has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	And if this cautery is not present, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a great olive cautery: and make the cautery deep according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	In the manner of cauterizing for Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When it happens that there is pain in the heel of the ankle, and the cause of it is cold and humidity: and the infirmant is cured with that, as we said in the explanation, and the cure does not suffice, and it is aged: then it is necessary to remove the infirmity from the gross humours with fleshy pills, or with artificial pills, or the like.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.</start_of_turn
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cauterizing in this is according to two ways: either with cautery with burning substances, or with fire.</start_of_turn
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many ways.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is that it is made over the heel of the ankle itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make the burn good depth, or bad.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space which is between every cautery be of the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the olive cautery be.</start_of_turn
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When the burn is made in the middle over the heel of the ankle itself.</start_of_turn
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four carpus?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	If one cauterizes with a circle whose shape precedes that of the dislocation of the ankle, one: to encompass the ankle entirely with the circle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin whole.</start_of_turn>
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the ankle itself, and does not extend up to the knee and thigh.</start_of_turn>
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends up to the knee and thigh, then cauterize with two cautery instruments above the knee, above the place where the said painful area is, where the pain is, and your cautery above the ankle of the four digits up to the outer side of the heel: and let the cautery be circular.</start_of_turn>
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.</start_of_turn
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	And if the patient says that the pain extends up to the toes, then cauterize there where the cautery of a point, or three, or four, or several, is needed for that.</start_of_turn
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he says that the pain is under the outer knee, then cauterize there with one cautery instrument.</start_of_turn
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And cauterize in all your cautery, so that you do not reach the nerve or the great artery, and that you do not draw towards you by that over the painful area the harmful document.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I know one who, having cauterized above the ankle, and having finished cautering, the ankle was swollen, until the whole foot was swollen, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted: then the solution of the belly ensued, and death followed shortly after.</start_of_turn
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain exists in both parts simultaneously, burn each one according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	Some wise men have said concerning cauterization of the anus, that this is the manner of its cauterization.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a mark like that of a nail, whose diameter is the middle of the palm: and be at the orifice according to the thickness of the kernel of the thumb, or less: and there be within it a third of itself.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there be space between every mark according to the quantity of the thumb node: and let the marks be opened from both parts: and let the height of them be like a node, or two nodes: and make a handle of iron adapted to the center of the marks
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is to be ignited in the fire, until it turns red, and throws sparks: then it is to be put upon the lower part of the anus resting on the outer side of the healthy part
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Burn thus each three cauterizations in oil once
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let it be left for three days
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then anoint with butter: and let the wound be opened for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, concerning this kind of cauterization, that we are little used to it, because of the terror of its aspect: and because of this, few expect it from us
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	But truly it is from the good ones that it receives benefit, and finds its place among them.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	And the cauterization with physicians is more perfect, as you make two holes in the palm of the hand, in which the wrist of the hand will descend from the air, or from iron, the length of the wall: and there be two nodes in the height of them, or as many as these
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there shall be space between each two quantities of the greatness of a finger, and there shall be an opening below and above: and that which contains itself to the inside, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	And lay it down upon the heel of the foot, the sickly one being placed upon the broad side of the sound foot
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand down upon the heel of the foot very much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	And then pour between two circles of warm water, which is heated with a little fire, and keep it for the quantity of an hour of time: and the sickly one will bear its own biting, and its own bringing-forth, for it finds biting like fire until the biting subsides
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And then lift up your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole foot with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place upon it butter, until the black of the bringing-forth be removed: and leave it for a few days, and it will come out with pus
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	This is the end of the treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	And take care of it with poultices, until it is healed
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends up to the hip, or the thigh: make for it a position in which there is water contained, as you did in the foot above.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	This is the way of warm water: and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali, and unburnt lime of both, and take a portion of each and put them into a new jar, the lower part of which is pierced with a small hole according to the quantity of the radius itself: and put under the bottom of the jar another jar filled with vinegar: and pour over the alkali and the lime from sweet water, which covers both through a finger: and when you have pressed them with your hand with good pressure: and pour out the jar, until the acute water of the lower part of the jar of vinegar is gone.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add all the water, and pour it over the other heel: and wait until it recovers.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	The water itself then becomes strong and acute, which is administered in many medical operations, and in cauterizing the rest of the limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the work of fire itself
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the physicians, those who cauterize widely, also like surgeons, and acacia gum, and chalk with soap, thus that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself reports that an old physician of the ancients, who cured him of pain in his knee and sciatica: and he praised its strength
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	He said that it did not require any other cure, and that he was healed from the bath alone, because perhaps he himself had entered the hot bath and came out of it healed
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from the green barley of a wise man: and if it is not found green, take it dry, grind: and give him much with some fat, and put it on the knee, where there is pain, or the thigh, or the hip: and bind it, and leave it for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the pain diminishing.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When it becomes soft, put it into the socket.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain departs, and it is healed
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no other cautery should be used along with these physicians, except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	Dioscorides himself says that the dung of goats, when cauterized with this, heals the sciatica: and does the cautery in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let a lancet be taken, and let an old oil be drunk, and let it be placed over the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and between the nails, and is nearer to the nail.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and burn it, until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it over the lancet and let it go, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease doing this until sensation returns by sensation through touch up to the edge, and the pain has ceased
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of burning is called the cauterization of the Vaccinum.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the cauterization of the pain of the back
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back from many bites, or from a wound, or from evacuation of excessive fluid, or in similar cases, from the infusion of cold and wet matter: and the cauterization is not useless, except in this single kind, which is done from the infusion of cold matter
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the sick person with foetid pills and like things, to make three lines on the back, where the pain is, following the width of the palm of the hand, after having made signs with the cautery in every line five burns, or more according to the quantity which comes from the patient's tolerance or the degree of his illness: and let the cauterization be done with the cautery needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, burn three or four times with the middle cautery needle, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Of the manner of cauterizing in the groin.
Caput XLV.	Head Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	Many such ailments happen to young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of the beginning of this ailment in children is: that it happens with tension in the neck when the head is bent forwards, and movement: and you will find it in the last rib and the nodes of the back, which begin to protrude over the rest of the ribs
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you have done this, and you wish to make it, then cauterize it with the cautery that is in the shape of a circle according to this form
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And grasp the cautery over the whole of the rib equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the rib with the cautery, make two or three points close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until it is healed as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful, lest you administer the cautery in a spasm of the nerve, which happens in swelling
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	In the same way as for cauterizing in Podagra, and for joined pains.
Caput XLVI.	Head Chapter XLVI
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains of the joints are from cold humors which flow upon every limb of the body, then when such pains happen in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call it Podagra.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When thus Podagra is cured of its cold cause with proper methods, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is necessary to cauterize after evacuation around the joints of the feet with many cautery needles: and let the cautery be of Olive oil
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if digestion is obstinate concerning the points upon the foot, then make with the cautery the points.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If pain ascends even to the knees, or if the other bands remain, and many times this happens, then burn the knee with three burnings, or four from every side, with the same cautery of Claudius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If indeed further burnings are necessary, then burn it with these again.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	Do not immerse your hand in the burning, but rather keep the thickness of the skin around it only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If pain ascends to the knees and the back: then carry out what we said concerning the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pain is only in the hands: then burn around the nails, as two lines are made to revolve.</start_of_turn>
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, the pain remains in the toes: then burn the points upon every nodule of the toe and upon the nail of the thumb.</start_of_turn>
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If pain ascends after a few days to the elbows or shoulders: then burn both from every side.</start_of_turn>
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	Do not neglect the infirm from the use of good remedies, from the administration of medicines.</start_of_turn>
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen be made and the phlegm be evacuated, recovery will take place with the help of God with this burning.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	¶ On the method of burning in ruptures.</start_of_turn
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or the bladder descends to the testicle, and this has begun nearby: then it is necessary to send away from the patient the people who have eaten in their day.</start_of_turn
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And it is used from soft things, from which the stool descends from its belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then sit between your hands over his back: and command him to keep his breath, until he goes out, or until you see a wound or an intestine
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then draw it down with your fingers, and sign with the imprint of the thumb under the fracture above the pelvic bone, with the sign which is like half of a circle to the upper parts of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the cautery, which is like this in form, until it turns white, and then remove the scabs.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or the wound to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then put your hand ministering over the place, so that the intestine does not go out: and you will open between the ribs, and put under it powder, and another over the ribs that holds the hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery over that sign, your hand with the cautery standing straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it there, until with it you follow the bone: or repeat it with it again until you have followed it with it until the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And watch prudently from the discharge of the intestine at the time of your cautery, that you do not burn it, and that it goes through over the patient or the wound, or great malice
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not follow with the cautery the bone, your operation is useless.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it should be subtle like the cautery of infants, according to their measure
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	And take care of the rest of the bandages, until the patient is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sickly man rest upon his back for forty days, until the swelling subsides.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And he must be given nourishment during the whole course of his treatment, that he may not suffer from hunger pangs or evacuations.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	When the swelling has subsided after forty days, then administer the ligature that has been performed, and keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	Let him rest from work and take nourishment of food and drink, and engage in healthy exercises.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is followed, the patient will recover completely.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I say that the treatment of ruptures with incision is in this chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures happen in the remainder of the belly, and are just beginning, and one wishes that they should not grow larger, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let it be as if a third of it had been burnt from that time forward
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	And treat it as we have said: and do not add to it
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	Others say that it should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	When it has been cauterized with the brand, and a line has been drawn that runs through the width at the upper side of the rupture, and a line that runs to the lower side.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery handle.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	In the case of pains caused by a fall or blow, or any other similar cause, cauterize with the tip only, without the handle.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When anything happens in some limb through wound or blow and pain remains fixed: and does not yield to treatment with physicians: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery of a Puncti.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be of every limb according to its size, and its proportion, and its toughness, and its nature, and the place of torsion, and the pain from it
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If it is healed from the first cautery, it is good
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cautery over it again.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the custom of these pains, they change from one limb to another that approaches them.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to follow these with the cautery until the infirmity is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	¶ As to the cautering of Lepra...
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprosy however when they are cauterized they require the greatest cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of Leprosy that comes from the putrefaction of phlegmas and melancholy: with such it is necessary to consider the cautery itself.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If the Lepra is not very deep and the swelling subsides with it as we have said in the discourse, and does not remain: and times over the infirmity which includes the corruption of the whole face: then cauterize over the head five times: one in the middle of the head known as the nucha, and the second below it facing the front at the end of the hair, and two over the two horns, and one behind the neck of the ear.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly, you must apply the cautery to your hand close to the bone, until an imprint is made in the bone: whereupon the cortexes will be split apart. Thus will the emission of thick vapor from the cavity be alleviated, and the cautery must also be applied over the spleen itself, as has been stated previously.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If, however, the leprosy is sparse over the diseased part, and is apparent clearly: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cautery instruments, as we have mentioned at the head, and with the cautery over the tip of the nose, and two over the two upper jaws, and two over the bones of the neck, and six over the bones of the back, and one large one over the boils which are at the root of the tail and one above the spleen itself: and two over the flanks: that is to say, over every flank one, and two over the knees: one over every knee, and two over the upper arms, and two over the elbows, and two over the wrists of the hands and feet: and cauterize over every heel of the feet.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And cauterize from the nerves which are over the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when the cautery is applied to the bones of the pelvis, and to another over the bones of the stomach, and to another over the spleen.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cautery, the more is the suffering, and the more painful it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery, as he does in health: because his body is already stupefied.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery should be of a suitable size, and of equal thickness according to the parts and the joints: as has been stated from the species of instruments
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cauterium with herbs and honey, and for the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Regarding the cautery in the wound
Caput L.	As for the cautery of the wound
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When some part of the body is swollen and requires treatment with medicines, oils, and poultices, but does not heal, then cauterize the swollen part with cautery, according to the size of the part or its hardness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let the cautery not pass through the thinness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cauterium with herbs and honey, and for the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when it is cauterized at something of swelling, which happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: then it will move the swelling
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not necessarily follow that because of this it should be avoided, except for those who are learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves moving the body
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Regarding the cautery in the Albaras wound
Caput LI.	When some part of the body is swollen and requires treatment with medicines, oils, and poultices, but does not heal, then cauterize the swollen part with cautery, according to the size of the part or its hardness. And let the cautery not pass through the thinness of the skin. Then care for the cauterium with herbs and honey, and for the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When the Albaras has subsided, and there is no sign of any healing from the medical arts: then cauterize over the deep cautery at once, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white is removed and the color is changed
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with herbs and honey, and lentils with oil of rose, and arnica leaves, and columbine blood and hyssop blood: take a little of each. Mix these all together, and make a line over the wound, and bind it up in place, until he is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Caput LII.	On the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning to form, and you wish to remove it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it turns around.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men, however, say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	I do not see that; for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have seen that happen many times before
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	It is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	On the method of cauterization in Adubelati
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, or because of excessive fat, or because of age, or because of weakness, and wishes to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati: then cauterize around it with multiple small cauteries by puncturing
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then remove the dressing
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will itself hasten with maturation
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then burn the cautery beforehand to this shape
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be below that which follows the infirmus, so as to alleviate the course of the wound.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterization in a corrupting tumor
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A wound is not harmless unless it be in an immobile limb, for it consumes itself: as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a wound consuming something which can bear the application of fire, then apply much fire, small and great blisters, according as it will be convenient in the place where the wound is consuming
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then burn it from all sides until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it inside or outside
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then keep it dry for three days, and apply above the burnt place powdered sulphur with oil, until all the scabs are eradicated and all the corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with nourishing unguents of flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore after three days new flesh has been born without corruption, it is good
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the burning over that which remains of the corrupted parts
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	The wound is to be treated with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It itself comes up in the place of the burn.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, the burning with fire is more rapid in healing: and I myself have said that the burning with medicine is in the proportion of two to one: take therefore two parts of the former and one part of the latter.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	In this way burn in the Claw and in the Verucca.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Many times this disease happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a great and widespread disease which damages the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And the burning in this case is done in two ways: with fire and with hot water
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As much as with fire, so too with the cautery iron must it be concaved like a feather quill: for it is made of iron, according to the quantity that contains the hand from all sides: and let the margins be slight.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the flame above the hand.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then draw the hand with the cautery around the circumference of the hand, until the cautery reaches the depth of the hand: and leave it for three days, until pus begins to discharge from it.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster the hand with sponges soaked in salt, and cover with a bandage: and leave the bandage on it overnight
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	The cautery will thereby be eradicated from its roots
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place where the burn has been generated until it heals
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If these are not concaved, and many times they happen on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply the cautery with warm water: and it is that you take a sponge of air, or iron, or feather quill: and place it on the hand, or over the wound.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of warm water into the sponge: hold your hand still, and draw the sponge with pressure from your hand downwards, so that the mark of the sponge be impressed at the root of the hand, and find the warm water to the depth of the hand: and expect the patient to remain still over the warmth of the warm water for an hour.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then remove it, for the hand is eradicated with its roots.</start_of_turn>
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Thus do with one after the other, until you reach all those which are from the cautery in the body.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them afterwards when they have been extirpated, when there is what generates flesh from the oozing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Then care for them afterwards when they have been extirpated, when there is what generates flesh from the oozing.
Caput LVI.	Then care for them afterwards when they have been extirpated, when there is what generates flesh from the oozing.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When anything happens to cause tremor from cold in the nerve, or from the fourth fever, or anything like this: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cautery instruments, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in the belly of it cauterize, and over the stomach cauterize.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor will cease when it is cauterized with olive oil, and the health of the cold will return to normal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The tremor will cease when it is cauterized with olive oil, and the health of the cold will return to normal
Caput LVII.	When anything happens to cause tremor from cold in the nerve, or from the fourth fever, or anything like this: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cautery instruments, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in the belly of it cauterize, and over the stomach cauterize. The tremor will cease when it is cauterized with olive oil, and the health of the cold will return to normal.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When pus and matter are expelled from the body of Albathir, that is, large abscesses which arise from corrupted matter
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary therefore at first when these appear to cauterize over every head of the abscess with fine cautery with a twig of myrrh whose extremity is kindled with fire
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long asparagus
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with needle cautery
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they have been cauterized enough at the beginning of their discharge in this way: and they do not increase: and the superflux is broken, and they heal from the inside out
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	It is necessary to perform this after evacuation with a phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	In the flow of blood from an artery to the wound.</start_of_turn>
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many things happen with the flow of blood from an artery which has been incised at the wound, which happens outside [the body], or at the incision of the afterbirth, or the cautery of the limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to close them off.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to anyone of them, then do it properly with your hand at the opening of the artery, and place over it your index finger: and tighten it much, until the blood is overcome under your finger, and does not escape from there anymore.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place in the fire a small olive pomade, and many in number: and blow over them, until they are ignited gently.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from this one, or a little, or a lot, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery over that very place: and immediately move your finger away: and hold the cautery, until the blood is closed.</start_of_turn
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	And if it escapes when you lift your finger away from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire.</start_of_turn
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease doing this until the blood is closed.</start_of_turn
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	Be careful not to burn the nerve which is there, and do not leave any harmful malice on the wound.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know this, that when blood flows from an artery, it is impossible to clamp it off; especially when the artery is large, except with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or as with a cautery, as we have said before.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities are contracted, and the blood is clamped off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or there are placed upon it medicinal things which have the property of clamping off blood, and are bound with a proper constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever, however, performs an excision with a ligature, and tightens with a cloth, or positions the burning things, and the like, does not give him great pain, except rarely
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this should happen to anyone, and there is no physician present, neither medicine: then one should begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have said, and constrict it tightly, until the blood is choked off above the part wounded, and above the artery
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved, but be kept in place with cold water or ice always, until the blood is congealed, and has become tough, and is clamped off
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile consider what is needed with a cautery, or with medicine

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	¶ On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and things like these.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	As we said in the first chapter, every ailment in which it is expedient to use a cautery or burning medicine, and the occasions when it is necessary, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I place the heads from the vertex to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I proceed in this chapter in the same way: as it is necessary to join what is severed.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I begin this, it is necessary to mention that which is in this chapter is from the error of that which is in the first chapter of cauterization
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this it is necessary to be cautious in this operation, because in this chapter there falls out a great amount of blood with the opening of the vein, or the incision of the apostema, or the opening of the orifice, or the cure of the wound, or the extraction of the arrow, or the incision of the stone, and such things: from all of which is associated with tremor and fear, and falls in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	I remind you that it does not fall to you to be hesitant in this thing, for when they fall to you in this art as in the art of men so also in the art of sickness.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	From this it is known that he who is raging with his illness is light in spirit: because of the intensity of his ailment and the length of his suffering
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when an illness is from fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	From this it is known that he who gives the antidote and says to you to hope for health, while his ailment is mischievous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	It is not proper that you consent to him who comes to you from this thing, whose way is like that
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be cautious above all of suddenness and harshness
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume of anything from this thing, except after a certain knowledge has been shown to you which confirms that it will bring about a successful outcome
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And thus be used in the treatment of all women's ailments, in prognostication and indication of that which is convenient for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in this lies help for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, son, your intellect, and does not take away from you direction and inspiration: because it is in his hand
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have set this chapter apart by chapters, according as it follows the chapter of Cauterization, from the navel until the feet: so that you may learn what you desire from this and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the treatment of water which collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this ailment often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens for an occult cause which is not known
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than children: and wherever I have seen it in anyone else, it has disappeared: because of this, it seems to me that it is appropriate to omit the operation in this case
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have also seen among children whose heads were filled with water, and whose heads would swell up every day, until they could no longer sit because of the size of their heads: and the moisture increased until they died
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture either accumulates between the skin and the bone: or accumulates under the bone on the soft part
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in this case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is slight, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head, about the length of two knots, so that the moisture may drain out
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the form of a sponge.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If there is too much moisture in the [wound], and the swelling is great, then make two incisions according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that the fluid bursts open the hair all around: and the water is driven out when you press your hand inside, and it does not remain hidden: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then suture the incisions with threads and wool
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then leave it covered with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament, and care for the wound with tension and caressing.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not make the head tight.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the patient with dry food with little moisture, until the limb is comfortable and healed
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider the size of the swelling and the collection of water
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is in the occiput more, or in the eyebrow, or in the right, or in the left
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Go up therefore with the incision where you see the swelling and the collection of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, that you do not cut an artery, and that there is no flow of blood, and that the patient does not die from that flow with the evacuation of the moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	As for the incisions of the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When any swelling occurs in the eyes or the chest, and the condition persists without benefit from medical treatment: then the last remedy in such a case is the incision of both arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when one wishes to make an incision, that he should seize the patient’s head firmly
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then grasp the place with rough cloth so that the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then tighten the patient’s neck with whatever cloth is available to him
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Consider where the vein is pulsating
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places where both of them are found are those which are behind the ears which are depressed: and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a branding iron upon each of them: and cut both of them with a lancet as sharp as possible, cutting through to the bone: and do this through the breadth of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce a sponge under the artery, and cut upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which jumps inside with great frequency.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to be sensible, then it is necessary to measure from the ear to the quantity of three fingers space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a branding iron, and find until bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	Throughout this is according to the quantity which appears to you from the patient’s vomiting and the filling of the artery itself.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the vein.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains on the bone from the incision, then cut that away, so that it does not cause a thick scab: then bind the vein with threads from linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with oil until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	As for the extraction of arteries, which are in the temporary condition.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man has an old wound of the head, or acute catarrh of the eyes caused by bitter humilities and heat in the lacerations of the times, or old salt, or urine, or similar things: and when they are treated with the methods of medical treatment, and not confirmed: then we are experts in extracting arteries from the times, or cauterizing them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of the operation for extracting them is that the surgeon shaves the hair that is in the times, and then approaches the apparent artery in the time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself is shown to you by its pulse, and rarely is it hidden except in a few people, or by excessive cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden, then the surgeon ties the head of the vein with whatever he has: then he rubs the place with rough linen cloth
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he boils the place with hot water, until the vein appears visibly
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a hook, which is like that which I have previously described.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin with ease, until you reach the artery
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then cut into the vein, and draw it upwards, until you have extracted it from the skin, and make the vein retract from all sides
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is slender: then enclose it with the extremity of a ligature.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it the part which extends as much as the extremities of the ligature, and tighten, and do not permit the flow of blood to proceed.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut and if it is not bound off, the blood does not ascend fully.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood six ounces, up to three ounces.</start_of_turn>
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary that you bind the two extremities of the ligature from double silk, strong, from silk: or from hemp cord, so that it does not become putrefied before the wound is consolidated, and that the flow of blood proceeds.</start_of_turn>
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess, which is between the two ligatures.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in an hour, or after an hour.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if necessary, cauterize the artery with a cautery until bone, with a knife cautery: until the extremities of the ligature are incised, and it is stable in the place of the work.</start_of_turn>
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better to do the work when the patient has a low fever, or one with a pale complexion.</start_of_turn
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is from a substance that dries up humors.</start_of_turn>
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to apply a dressing.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be covered with dry lint: and put upon it feathers of a fowl around the work.</start_of_turn
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the completion of the work, care for it with dry physicians, which make the meat grow, and with compresses, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the operation blood flows from an artery, then promptly bind it off with cautery, or place a plug in the opening: and suspend your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If neither of these is present, then place over the site of the digit your hand, until the bleeding stops.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And immerse the site with cold water, until the pain subsides, and tighten according as necessary
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from this, that which is more gentle and easier for the extraction of the artery, is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery which has two blades: and let the pain of the two blades be like an almond
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	Truly, these are much less painful than two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are acute, like two blades, they prepare both [the artery and vein] with cold: and do not bite the flesh with speed
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When there is somewhat of thickness in this, it is held in the palm of the hand with the heat of fire, and the flesh is quickly severed: with this therefore the work is better in every way, gentler and easier
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between the two blades be equal to the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and withdraw both flames until they reach the bone, and pierce the vein in two places: so that the length which is between the extremities of the vein is elongated
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For with this cautery the vein does not coagulate completely.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Take care of the sharp tears of the eyes which are constant from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are excessively abundant, and their course exceeds the upper part of the head, and do not confer any benefit with the aid of medicine, and stain the face of the patient red, and he feels a sensation of wandering in his front, like the wandering of ants: and his eyes are dilated, humid, as though they are corroded, for the hairs of his eyelashes are corroded along with the corrosion; and his eyelids are inflamed from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients deemed it appropriate to intervene in their treatment by means of an operation, and they named this treatment "Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is appropriate to pluck the hairs that are on his front.</start_of_turn>
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equal incisions on the front, according to the length of the front: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be at an equal distance from the length of the nose in the middle of the front, and the second according to the length of the prominence of the lacerations, and the third from the other side: and take care to avoid the arteries that are on both sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of your two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be as much as three fingers together. And let there be prepared a sponge or dry sponge, with which to soak up the blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the sponge with two sharp extremities, whose following shape is like that.</start_of_turn
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision on the temporal side, up to the second incision: and scrape with it the whole skin that is between the two incisions, with salt, which is over the bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract the sponge, and introduce into the first incision a different instrument, which is called the acute cultellare, from one blunt end, not from the acute end.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the acute end towards the flesh with the attached skin and the blunt end towards the bone: and push it in until it reaches the middle incision: and cut through everything that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which continues from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle incision until you reach the other incision.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when the bleeding has ceased, express the clots from the wound
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every incision a patch of old cotton, and place upon these soaked sponges in wine, and oil, or vinegar
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And take care that there be no formation of a cold abscess
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day strengthen the ligament, and give a plentiful infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the basic wound, and the rest of the wounds which need healing: until they are healed
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	And take care of the acute tears of the eyes from the inside of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When some acute, acrid, and sticky catarrhs occur: and you see the eyes extended, parched, and the sight is blurred: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hair falling out from the eyelashes, and there is severe pain in the depth of the head, with sneezing following: then take note of these signs, for these matters and the catarrhs do not come from these substances alone, except from many tears
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	The best treatment for wounds is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	The best is that you shave the front of the wound from the root.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the front, or on the other side according to the width, and commence the incision from the left side towards the right side: and let the incision reach the bone: and stretch your hand away from the teeth, which move during chewing: until the bone is revealed. And dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the wound with a piece of cotton wool, or with strips of linen cloth
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that they do not cause a cold abscess
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have finished, and you see that the abscess is diminishing: then it is necessary to anoint the bone, until the flesh begins to grow there anew
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with the regimen of drying which makes the flesh grow: thus as if you took two parts of barley and four parts of colophony, and prepared from these a plaster, and administered to these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	And in summer care for it
Caput VI.	Chapter VI
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All things that fall in summer are of four kinds: either a mineral substance, or one like stone, such as iron and copper; or it is a plant, such as lentil and bean; or it is a fluid, such as water, vinegar, and blood; or something akin to it.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When such a substance falls in summer, that is not derived from earth, nor does it grow in summer, it exposes the summer sun: if you pour oil on the stone, then distill from the oil something from vinegar or urine.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform the extraction forthwith, and make the patient sit upright with his head supported. Then pour oil into the nostrils close to the point of discharge of the wound, after you have placed around the ear a plug of cotton wool or wool, and have extended the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many are the things that are done with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If this does not suffice, then perform the extraction forthwith with sponges, that is, fine sponges: whose form is like this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If they do come out with the sponge, that is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform the extraction forthwith with a blunt needle of small diameter.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If these do not come out with that, then make a hole in the air, and insert the extremity of the cannula into the ear very much, and pour oil around the cannula with powdered plaster, so that there be no air remaining except that which is in the cannula: then draw out with your hand with great force
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many are the things that are done with this care.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If these methods do not suffice: take from barley or wheat flour, that is, ground barley, with which you thicken soups: and put it on the extremity of the radius after you have wrapped around the thumb the lower part of the wrist: then insert it into the ear with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If these things do not come out, then prepare to make an incision, before the swelling becomes severe, or a spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of making the incision is like that of a phlebotomy in the forearm: and draw out from the blood according to the measure of his virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and support his ear upwards, and find the wound alongside the fat in the hollow of the ear: and make the incision in a crescent shape, until you reach the bone: then remove it with the instrument.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then seal the wound from this hour until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If a foreign body has fallen into the wound from a piece of barley that has sprouted and swelled: then perform its extraction then.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not yield to evacuation, then take a small, fine sponge, according to this fashion.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And perform the excision with it of that kind of grain which has fallen into the wound, and do not leave it there, when you know that it is wet with earwax, until you put a lot of cotton over it: then extract it with forceps, or with a gentle hand, or with a suction, as we have said, for its extraction will alleviate it.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	And when water enters the wound, the patient must keep vomiting until the condition is better: and immediately apply a bandage to the wound with some old cotton: and it lies upon the wound where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it comes out through this, that is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, tight, soft, and heat them with fire from below, and let the patient pass it through his ear hole: and salt his foot on one side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the wound.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone until all the water has come out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And when the water comes out like this, take from the fire, or from a sponge, one extremity and introduce it into the wound: and kindle the other extremity with fire, until most of it is burned up
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	And do it again with another sponge, and do this many times, until all the water has come out: and extract it with a tube according to what has been said in the stone
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	In the extraction of an animal that is inside the body, if its body is small, like a flea, and is similar to it, take care of it as I said in the previous discussion.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	When the worm has been generated in the belly and you have treated it as we have said in the previous discussion and in the treatise on distillation, and if you do not confer cure, then you must touch the belly only.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with the hand, or with fine tweezers.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then take a needle whose form is like this, narrow below and wide above: and introduce the blunt end into the belly according to the capacity which the sick person tolerates: then draw out with that strong suction
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you in coming out, then smear around the circumference of the needle with grease, as I said in the stone
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	When they do not come out as we have said: then perform distillations which the ancient experts have learned for the interception of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be like the effusion of oil and medicines into the belly with this instrument whose form is depicted here
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Like the way you make it from silver or from air, narrow below and wide above, in which there is a small hole, wide above
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the driving force that is in the curvature of the needle be made from air from the center
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	If so be it, grasp the radius and immerse its extremity in the cottum of the solution: then pour oil, or succum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it remain there. Then introduce the radius with the cottum above and express it with your hand’s compression until the oil is driven into the auditory canal and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be heated with fire at a low heat: and beware lest anything be distilled in the ear when it is cold: for medicine tolerates not this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	If so be it, grasp the radius and immerse its extremity in the bottom of the solution: then pour oil, or succum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it remain there. Then introduce the radius with the solution above and express it with your hand’s compression until the oil is driven into the auditory canal and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be heated with fire at a low heat: and beware lest anything be distilled in the ear when it is cold, for medicine tolerates not this.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some children emerge from the birth canal uninjured.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes occurs also that some people suffer from hair in the ear from a wound, or from flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this hair sometimes happens in the deep cavity of the ear, as it does not usually happen: and sometimes it happens outside the cavity of the ear slightly, and it usually happens thus.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which happens in the deep ear, and which does not comprehend the aspect, is in many situations difficult to heal
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which happens thus, it is necessary to put the ear of the patient on fire only, and to touch it: then if you see the hair appearing, open the ear with a fine spatula, whose form is like this which follows, so that its extremity is in which there is a slight width, whose some part is acute: and the rest of the spatula is smooth: so as not to injure the ear
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If any swelling has arisen from meat of the ear: then hold one finger under the skin, and cut through with ease until the whole flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the swelling is deep in the ear: then take a fine needle, thread it, and cauterize with fire: then remove it from the flesh of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel swelling along with pain, which comes from an infirm person with a heavy deafness, try to open it with ease: and cut through, so as not to damage the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a compress according to the quantity of the opening which you have made in the incision: do this for a few days, until you are certain that the wound has healed
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a compress, and moisten it in rose-water, and sprinkle upon it powdered alum, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you have put in the ear some remnant of pus: then it is necessary that you remove the compress, and allow another compress to be put in, which has been made with rose-water, until the swelling has gone down: then care for it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flows: then submerge a sponge, or pack wool in cold water, and put on the ear: and use the remaining treatment which expels the said blood-flow according to the treatise on distillation
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	About the care of the eyelids of Al-Thaili.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.</start_of_turn>
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the things that cause Al-Thaili to swell in the eyelids, when they are wet and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to hold them with nails: or with a finger, and cut through with ease from their roots
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place upon the wound a layer of cheese.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine needle cautery.</start_of_turn>
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterization is better after the incision.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Many things indeed return when something remains of their roots.</start_of_turn
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Regarding the care of the great palpebrae of the eye.</start_of_turn>
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.</start_of_turn
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the palpebrae of something which assimilates with Crandinus in its magnitude, its hardness, and because of this it is called Grand: and it is an aggregation of gross humidity in the upper and lower palpebrae.</start_of_turn
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore is like this, as you see, if there is a Grand proceeding from the palpebra, which appears from the palpebra and moves to every part, and its result is easy.</start_of_turn
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore above the fissure for the width.</start_of_turn
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape away the whole thing with ease until it bleeds.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend the wound with a suture, and cut it off.</start_of_turn
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however it is not prepared for you to cut, except when you penetrate the palpebra with a small incision, then it is harmful to the sick in some way.</start_of_turn
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the incision is large: then gather it together with a suture: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	If it is small, it will not bring any harm from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointment will restore the limb itself and heal the wound.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	If it is great, it inclines towards the inner parts of the ear towards the surface, then turn the lid, and suspend the large quantity with a single thread: except that you do not wish to make an incision, and press from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if the lid is prolonged by incision, it does not harm in any way
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the large quantity, with salt water: and take care of the place with it that is inccised, until the infirmity is healed
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	As for the care of the eyelids...
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The scab that is formed on the upper eyelid is called Axirnath: and this most often happens to children: and it weighs down the eyes of them, and causes mucus to collect in the mornings, and they are unable to see the sun, because the tears run down to them, and because of this their eyes are always moist over their face, and over their eyes they sleep, and their eyelids are always wet under their eyebrows: and the prominence of Axirnath appears in the eye, and when you press on it with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way to treat it is to put the patient's head in your lap
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen, and prepare it with oil, and make from it a circle according to the quantity that contains Axirnath from all sides
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that humidity with the stamper applied there are incisions made for the width, and let there be no incision greater than that which is made in phlebotomy at depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it may happen that you must find the whole skin, until you reach Axirnath in the midst of many arrangements of things, for Axirnath comes out from the incision following the shape of the white crust of bread.</start_of_turn>
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract therefore the blood with the sponge which you have infiltrated between your fingers outwards: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and take heed, lest you add anything to the incision, lest you reach the eye with the stamper, and damage it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the incision, you add a little at the incision with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract the blood as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the sponges in vinegar and water, and put them on the place, and bind them with threads.</start_of_turn>
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men there are some who pour salt there, and put it in the hollow of the incision, so that the moisture remaining from that humidity will liquefy.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a thick blood clot occurs in the place of the stamper, take care of it with soothing compresses, until it heals.</start_of_turn
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	As for the way of treating the eye, that is, when the eyelashes are softened, from which it results that the eye shines like it should not.</start_of_turn
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.</start_of_turn>
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When the hairs on the eyelashes are added beyond their normal course among the natural hairs, and when they become numerous: then they themselves harm the eye, causing the discharge of tears, the softening of the eyelids, and inflammation, until such time as the cause of the destruction of the eye is produced.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	The eye is treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as has been previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or by Ataxmir through incision and suture
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cannas, as I shall say
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then grasp the eyelid of the eye with your left hand
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns white, it is good
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle through the fold of the eyelid, where the hair arises, and let the needle penetrate with the thread, and place it close to the eyelashes, that is, at the margin of the eyelid where the eyelashes arise: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and suture the wound with the thread.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added eyelashes with a sponge, the matter which has escaped from the greater lachrymal gland up to the lesser lachrymal gland.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cotton wool or gauze: then close the eyelid with a suture, which should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However it is necessary to know that this figure is to be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From the eye inward is he who demands that an incision be made from the eyelashes as much as is necessary, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelashes.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when the sponge has been found above two lines which you have marked, and you have begun from the greater lacrimal gland up to the lesser lacrimal gland, and there is one incision near the natural eyelashes, as is the thickness of a radius
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape the whole thing off
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with two sutures the two lips, with a needle and a fine thread: and bleed away the blood, and cause to adhere what is superfluous from the threads over two eyebrows, with some useful things, if you wish to do so: and if not, do not worry
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the suture and the thread for three days, or four: afterwards care for it
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let go of the wound without a suture, and care for it like that, which will dry up and contract.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelashes are raised towards the sealing of the wound and the gathering of it: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	Thus the old doctors taught of Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But indeed in this is solicitude over the infirm, and it is from a good operation, and not in this is there any fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way is in Ataxmir also: and it is that the sign on the eyelid should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to the form of this which follows, and then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to the form, with equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible to retain the hook, and it does not suffice: then grasp the point where the thread lies and introduce it into the middle of the figure. And introduce another thread near the larger tear and another near the smaller tear: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand with an equal elevation: and elevate the skin above that which is signed with the mark of the cut, as we have narrated
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with the suture: and care for it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, swelling occurs at the incision or the wound: hold that swelling with the cauter, and with like things, from the settled unguents.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelashes also swell, as their hairs turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you should use what we have said concerning the incision: but the sutures in both places are artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is that you cover the eyelash, and split the wound which is inside, according as I have narrated
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two needles, or two thin sticks: of which the length is according to the length of the eyelash, and the width of them is less than the width of the pupil: and you will insert them at the extremities from both sides where you have the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather together both things with slightness over that which remains from the eyelash of the eye, and string two needles from both sides firmly, and let go of it every few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin, therefore, being tightly closed, will die, and become black, and putrefy, until it falls away by itself
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it tarries, then at that time cut with the shears.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it solidifies, elevate the eye: and do not prick the hair
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	This is the form of two needles which you make according to this figure, and in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Regarding the elevation of the hairs pricked in the eye with the needle
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is that you take a fine needle and introduce it through the silk thread, which is fine
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you gather its extremities and knot both ends with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be one palm
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make another fine knot on the thread under this one in a short space, and knot the extremities of this.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the patient's head in your lap, and let it rest against your chest so that the operation is evident: because the operation is slight, or even insignificant.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the knot at the root of the eye, and make it penetrate the eye quickly, until you have extracted the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw out the hair until above the knot: and introduce the needle into the knot with the hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand away with it, until the hair comes out with the knot in the eye with the natural hair.</start_of_turn>
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, the knot is drawn out and the hair does not come out with it: draw out the knot downwards, with the thread which you made in it, until the knot comes out through the upper hole, and without causing any damage to the eye: then you draw out the knot and the thread, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair has grown back in its place and has sprouted on the surface of the flesh.</start_of_turn
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, either associate it with a long hair from natural hair, and elevate it with it: or let it go, until it has grown out, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	If the hair is short, either associate it with a long hair from natural hair, and elevate it with it: or let it go, until it has grown out, and then elevate it.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called the Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This condition is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental, therefore, is due to the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and the like
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	The method of treatment for this is to find the consolidation and to separate its lips, and to place between them a layer of linen, and to bind them until it is healed
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And do not use in the treatment of this that which will irritate and harden it: for if you do, the Alxatrata will become worse than before: rather use those things which soften it, such as barley straw: and mix with water, in which is soaked wheat, seed of flax: and unguent of oil, which is liquefied with some oil: and apply with it the bandage.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your skill in treatment is, that you prepare everything with ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate, according to the form which was in the beginning
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we mentioned is not except for some rectification of the Alxatrata, so that it does not return to its original form
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Of the care of the Alxatrata which happens in the lower eyelid, and is rustling or contraction upwards to the right and left
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This lower part which is called the Alxatrati is truly named after the Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And it is accidental from a wound, or a fracture, or a burn, or things like these
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operation in this is that you take hold of the point where there is a double thread, and you pass the loop through the flesh from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread passes through both extremities of the flesh
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut the vein with a broad scalpel
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the edge of the eyelid returns to its normal position as it should be, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, grasp the radix and place it in the wound, and secure it with it: and find two holes in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two holes go from two angles of the incision, until they meet and make an angle: until when they gather together make the figure of this letter "L".
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove the flesh by the amount which is the width of its obtuse lower angle, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then unite the separated parts: sew them with a thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them as we have said, of soothing medicines and compresses, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Alxatrati comes from a fracture, and a suture, or a burn: then it is necessary to find a flat wound under the eyelashes, even as before
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with a sliver, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	Then perform the operation according to the treatment of Alxatra, when it is above or below, that is, as is prepared from the form of Alxatra.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For there are many varieties in the form: and the prudent artist prepares the skill in whatever way is possible for him, until he brings the figure to a natural shape, or almost so, and the patient himself, according as it suits him from the operation and the instruments in many arrangements
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this adhesion happens to many people, it is like the consolidation of the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and it hinders its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore one must introduce the tip of the radius under the eyelid, and raise it up: or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel, which should not be as sharp as the cutting edge of the scalpel, but rather blunt and low: so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and the tissue returns to its natural shape, and the adhesion is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt-water into the eye, when you have washed it out: or instill it from a vial containing ground pearls dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the lip and the eye with a sliver of linen: and put on the eye a fleece soaked in alum or wool: and on the third day use a sponge, and solid dressings, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is fleshy: and it is like soft earth, fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, like frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or when you attempt to grasp it with a nail, it breaks and does not remain in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	Neither of these two kinds begins, except from greater tears, until it has gradually gone round, until it covers the useful thing, and blocks light, and the movement of the eye
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of working in its incision is: that you place your sickly head in your hand
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open its eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail with a nail of few doublings, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the needle, and introduce it through the hair of the horse, and hair, or thread: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and ligate the nail with the thread, and stretch it upwards: and remove the surrounding hair around the pupil, as if you were shaving it until the last of it
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then make the rest of the incision at the root of the tear with a fine scalpel, or with small scissors: and let go of the natural flesh of the tear, so that it does not flow excessively from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a nail alone: or with thread, as we said
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is to be scraped out with a blunt spatula of gentle curvature, the form of which is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	Take care not to tear the delicate membrane of the bladder, and insert the spatula until a perforation is made through the pupil
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	After the incision, pour in some powdered salt or mix from barley and release it until tomorrow.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then keep it clean and dry until it heals
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is insensitive and not liable to irritate the membrane, neither does it bulge out in it, then it is to be treated with multiple medicines, and will heal as I have said before
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to make an incision in it, then open the wound of the patient, and grasp the bladder cautiously with a fine and gentle spatula, of the kind whose shape is this
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And remove the nail above the root with dexterity and skill
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If it is to be applied for a long time and becomes softened and broken, and leaves a mark in the membrane, then pour from this hour until tomorrow from barley or from red pepper or salt, and bathe the eye until tomorrow
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation until all of its parts are restored to their proper places
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there remains in the eye a soft swelling: then indeed release it and care for the swelling until it heals
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation again with greater reason until it heals
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the prominence of the tear duct causes great discomfort in the eye, it is to be sutured with a fine needle, and cut from it a part of it: do not make the last incision, lest the flow of tears be obstructed
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then remain still in the tearful eye until it becomes red, or until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Since the incision of the Alguardenic [iris], and the native flesh in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in the eyes of men, red flesh is composed or superposed, covering the pupil, approaching or tightening over the eyelashes, and sometimes turning the eyelashes outwards: and it is like a rose petal.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in this is also like placing the diseased head in your lap
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect all the flesh with the hooks that are suitable for this: and hold it with one forceps, or with the hand
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until the whole of it is finished with the knife
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And burn away from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and make your incision as we said in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the fat is collected, as it will appear after this head
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete, and you have moved away all the Alguardenic, then put the eye out of salt and vinegar: or distill into it a coarse powder of red, and similar things from the physicians who have corroded: and put over the eye a bandage of wool or lint: so as to secure it from the heat of the afterburn
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	And if anything remains of the Alguardenic, and blood becomes hot, and the afterburn is strong: then let go of the eye, and care for it until the afterburn has ceased
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then return over it with the operation, until it is healed
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do as when meat is added which occurs in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	And truly it is necessary that other care for the whole eye be excluded from both natural causes and accidental causes, working with iron: and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you have ascertained that the limb can tolerate that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the collection of fat from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Fat is a red marrow which covers the eye, and prevents the moisture from doing its work: and it weakens the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is therefore necessary that you first consider whether the eye in which there is fat is strong and not affected by any other ailment apart from the fat: then collect the fat from it
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to keep the head still in your hand
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one needle or two according to your prudence: and let the needle be thin twice the diameter, according to this form, or two needles are placed into the body together, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those veins with caution, and drain the blood every hour until you have removed the veins from the eye and they have dissolved: and take care not to damage the eye with the tips of the forceps
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your work: lest you burn anything except the veins
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you are finished, then instill in the eye a little oil, or red: so that its sharpness may dissolve what remains of the fat.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible to collect the whole of it in this hour, then plaster the eye with this, which will soothe the eye pain: and leave it for a few days until the pain has subsided: and keep it warm from the after-effect; then repeat over it in the same manner until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of the swelling of the nose
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the swelling of the nose a Fistula, which they cure with cautery or with acute medicine containing burning substances, as they have mentioned previously concerning it
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in it: except that you find an abscess on the swelling at its origin, and extract the entire moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is thus exposed, and the matter is corrupted, or blackened, then cauterize it with an instrument of this shape
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	This is called the cautery of the head
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it from iron without any hole, and let its head be round like an egg, which is pierced with the point of a lime or with a needle and a fine puncture: and place it over the corrupted place of the bone
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then draw it out between your fingers, and press your hand lightly nearby, until you know that the corruption has gone away: and do it again.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with external astringents
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If thus the place is solidified, and there is formed in it flesh, and the swelling subsides: and there remains no redness, no swelling, and no pain in it: then you know that it is healed
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Caput XX.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	If not, then it is not in this faculty [of surgery], except to reduce the swelling to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	The manner of handling the testicles is as follows: take many soft and numerous bulges, and double each bulge from four: make many from these: then place one upon another, according to the quantity required for the eye: then bind them together with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	Repeat the process with the closed wounds without causing any cuts.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the swellings, and keep the eye tightly closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is again softened, it is necessary to bind it tightly: then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If, therefore, the eye has again bled from the veins, that is good: and if not, repeat the dressing, the bulges, the bandage, and the binding until the eye is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Of the incision of the vein of the tunica.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the vein of the tunica, then it will protrude and proceed outside the eyelids like a grain of the vein, and will be damaged in the form of a man by this: and it is necessary to make an incision in this: then the operation in this is as we have said, and it is that you introduce the needle into the root of the vein from the lower part to the upper part
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle in which the double thread is found, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then make an incision at the place of the double thread, and bind the part of the vein around the needle with the thread: and bind the thread tightly
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place above the eye a wool soaked in alum: and leave it until the thread has come out with the vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eyes while they are comfortable, until the wound has healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	When the wound has been bound about with a circle of cloth from all sides, until the eye regains its natural elevation.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then make an incision with a fine needle, which will reach the depth of the eye, and apply moisture of albumin, and the eye will sink down, and insert at once: then bind it up until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the care of the cornea.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.</start_of_turn>
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not anything other than health which has gathered in the eye, similar to water which descends and is not itself.</start_of_turn>
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way to deal with it is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take hold of his head with your hands from both sides, and move it until you feel the health coming down to the lower parts of your eyes.</start_of_turn
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then remain still, and do not descend, and open your eyes: and the patient will see as well as before: and if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is water.</start_of_turn
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the descent of the health is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine needle and find with it above the corneal membrane a part of the conjunctiva close to the cornea in a circle, until the health comes out.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has come out, then instill in the eye lukewarm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have ground barley and honey: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the care of water which descends into the eye, or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Concerning the care of water which descends into the eye, or a cataract.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken of the various kinds of water which descend into the eye, and which cause the symptom of perforation which the declarer and explainer have mentioned. Take this into consideration accordingly for the sake of health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore it is necessary that you should make the sick man sit with his back to the light, close to the lamp: and bind his healthy eye firmly, and stretch out the other eye: if the eye which has the water in it is the left eye, then take the right hand; or if the eye which has the water in it is the right eye, then take the left hand
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand with the thumb, if the left eye is the one which has the water in it: or take your left hand if the right eye is the one which has the water in it
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of your thumb close to the rim of the eyeball at the level of the apparent lower lacrimal gland: then push the thumb with force: and you will see that the thumb has gone right through the membrane of the eye: and you will feel that the thumb has passed through to the bottom of the eye.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the distance of the thumb from the pupil to the end of the black circle: is the circumference of the eye
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see this in the pupil of the eye by the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the thumb until it reaches the place where the water is
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the lower eyelid downwards one after the other.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If thus water descends immediately, then the patient will immediately close that which he has opened, and the thumb in his eye
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If water flows down, then place the sponge second, before it flows out through the opening.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is finished and does not rise: then draw out the sponge easily: and you will gradually move your hand back
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt crystals: and wash with it until the eye is clean
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put over the eye the whole bandage, or wool soaked in rosewater, and alum: and bind with it the healthy eye
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we who are of this time put on the eye a plaster of pounded gypsum with alum.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If it does not obey the sponge at the entrance of the eye on account of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard and cold: then you must take a sponge which is called Alberid, which has this shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Wash with it as well as with the hand, together: and do not put your hand into the hole: and do not do anything except make the sponge reach the bottom of the eye.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then put in the sponge, as we have said
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And in addition to that, prepare for the patient a soft bed, made in the center of the room, in which he may lie on his back in a dark room: and prevent all movements, and from coughing: and give him to eat something which will soften his nature: and do not move his head to the right or the left at all
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the dressing remain in place according to its position until the third day
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then take it out of that dark room, and make an examination of his eye: and make him drink something
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	Then do not make it in the hour of treatment, nor immediately after incision: rather, it is necessary that something else should hold it in place: for otherwise water ascends quickly through the gaping wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, there is a soft swelling: then it is necessary that you wash the eye before the seventh day: and straighten it when it is settled with that which rests it: then when it is settled, hold it in place with the mouth above it as much as is necessary for a few days, while it exists in that dark chamber
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then go out of the house gradually, and settle in their own cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	Know that in the bath a student should not be without sight for a long time: then indeed he will hear about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed it has happened to us some from the Alayrach people, who said that a perforation had been made in the magdan of Alayrach, through which water flows
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed we have not seen anyone in our land who has done this: nor have we read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that this is something new
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of spirits of the magda, as they rest upon it who knows them not.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Be of air itself: and their extremities are like those of a triangle, and their peak is acute
Formae magda.	The forms of the magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of the newborn flesh in the nose
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When the Carnes flesh is born in the nose, various things are added to it from which something is assimilated like the claws of many feet: and from this there is a cancerous tumor, a stone, of a dusky color: and from this there is what is soft flesh, not of a dusky color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	If there is anything fleshy in these meats which is soft, not fraudulent, neither cancerous, you must cause the sick person to sit between your hands facing the sun, and open his nostrils, and expel the wind from those meats: then draw them outwards, and cut whatever you have apprehended from them with a fine and sharp knife from one side, until you know that the whole flesh has been excised.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of that from whose excision is impossible: then cut that with a fine instrument until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates it, or a thick pus arises: then oppose to it that which is expedient: either from malignant pus, then cauterize it until the blood is separated, and remove all the flesh.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then expel through the nose after the incision of the flesh, and water, or liquid.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nostrils open, and there proceeds from it moisture up to the palate, then you know that he is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If indeed the moisture does not penetrate, according to what is expedient, then you know that the flesh has remained in the upper bones of the nose, which did not come out with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is expedient to insert a thread of fine silk which has some thickness, and to tie in it many knots: and place between every knot as much as a digit, or less: and the patient will vomit, so that he sends out one extremity of the thread through the nose with a sound, until it has passed through to the epiglottis, and has gone out through his throat
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many do the like of this like Attomus the boy in school: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes it to be.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two extremities of the finger, one which goes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then bind the flesh around the knots which are in the finger
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now bound around the knots of the finger.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread: and put it in the nose after bleeding has ceased. Give it three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away everything that remains of the flesh
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put in the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, more treatment is required, use this.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the head-purging, when oil and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this from silver or brass: which is like a small lamp, open like a conch shell: and the space of its meatus is like that of barley
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the cannula for the head-purging should be full, closed: which has a handle at its end, with which you will hold it, when you heat it in oil, or what you wish from succus, and the contents that flow out.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Note on the translation: The medieval Latin translation of the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis is full of archaic and obscure language. The translation provided above is an attempt to render the meaning of the original text while maintaining the integrity of the language. However, it is important to note that some of the terminology and concepts may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many swellings of the Thelul of the nose are born in the extremity of the nose, and they grow and increase with the days, until the aspect of the wound is changed
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its apparition, it should be applied to the wound, and its entirety should be consumed.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place above it either the cautery or a burning medicine which is in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore its incision is delayed until it has become large, then consider whether it is a stone, hard, dark in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, because the swelling is cancerous
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For there are many who have seen that which incides a tumor brings forth from itself a great malice over the part which it had.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and if the incision is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the patient and perform the incision without fear, without hesitation: and care for the place with that which cleans and closes, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Of the suture of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when solution of continuity is accomplished in some cartilaginous substance, it is little useful in that operation, except in some individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything has happened from that, that you consider whether there is a wound which remains connected with its blood: and then join together the edges of the wound with suture: then care for it until it is healed
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the solution of continuity of the lips has already been separated and each part is sound: then it is necessary to scour every part from its outer surface until the blood has clotted
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join together the lips with suture, and string them, and sprinkle above it dragon's blood, and oil of lentils: and place above the powders a plaster plug, and any other solid plaster: and let it go bound for two days, or three
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then solve it yourself, and move the medicine: and let it go, until the threads are severed by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the unguent, until it is healed
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The way of stitching is that you join the solution of continuity, or with an obtuse angle, as we have said in the stitching of the belly: or you join the solution with the thread, as you have been told
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	About the extraction of the nodes of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people suffer from swelling in the insides of their lips, resembling hard grains of grass: and some of these are small, and some are large
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and to find over every node of them, and to suspend it with a hook, and to cut it off from all sides
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then place the place after the incision with a bandage, until the blood is stopped
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then apply vinegar, and care for the place with that which has styptic properties, until the wound is healed
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	About the incision of the natural meat over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times there is formed on the gum additional meat which the ancients called abuluss
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore to suspend it with a hook: or to grasp it with tweezers, and to cut it off at its root, and let the pus run out, or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the place a bandage, or some other powdery astringent, desiccant.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	And if the meat returns after the treatment, namely that it comes back, then cut it away again, and burn it: for it does not return after being burnt
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the reason of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Concerning the reason for teeth affected by iron.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they gather on the surfaces of teeth from both inside and outside, and between the gums there are rough, hard layers, and when they decay and become yellow, and the gums become soft and bleeding, then the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth become loose from that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore that you make the invalid hand rest between your hands, and the head of the sufferer in your lap, and that you apply oil and ointment to the tooth and the gums, where you see the rough layers, like sand: until something remains from that, and in the same way make from blackness, and yellowness, and citrine, and other things until it is moved
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is at the beginning of the reason is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the reason on another day, the second day, and the third day, until you finally reach the study of it which you desire
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you know that teeth require different rasps of various forms, many figures: according to how you prepare for your operation: because the rasp that files the tooth from below is different from the rasp that files between the teeth, according to other shapes
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of rasps are prepared for you, which you will use.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Concerning the extraction of teeth in pain
Caput XXX.	When the tooth is loose from its socket and the pain does not depart from it, but remains in the bone, and cannot be removed by other means, then it is necessary to extract the tooth.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to treat the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and afterwards to eradicate it
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	It is not in vain that it is supplanted when it is eradicated: because it is a sublime substance: until when it is not an excuse to eradicate it, then it is necessary to consider that the invalid should eradicate it himself, so that it will be firm, and confirm to you the painful tooth
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many are the causes of pain in the infirm, and they suppose that it is in the tooth itself and eradicate it: afterwards the pain does not recede until the infirm tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We do not go there from the operation of phlebotomies.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When it is certified to you that the tooth itself is painful, then it is necessary to sacrifice around the tooth with a spatula, in which something of value is to be placed, until the gum is severed from all sides: then move the digit with your fingers, or with fine forceps little by little, until you break it
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place in that place large forceps in a good location, and keep the head of the infirm between your knees: which you must firmly hold, so that it does not move: then draw out the tooth according to the rule, so that you do not break it
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and move it, as you did at first
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then you must fill that hole with silk: and tie it with the extremity of a fine thread, so that it does not break in the time of your constriction with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you take care well when you sacrifice around the gum from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your courage, that you do not break it, and remain above that which is more painful to you at first
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	Beware, that you do not do what the phlebotomists do in their frenzy, and their audacity in respect of its eradication, except that you administer what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many indeed make us endure great sicknesses of men, which are more difficult to break, and leave all the roots thereof, or some of them: or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have been informed many times
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is bound after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If blood flows from the place (which often happens), then something should be placed over it: and if not, cauterize it if it does not cause you to bleed more
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forceps which are used to grasp the tooth in the first place must be of fine form, their handles long and their handles broad, so that they do not twist when pressure is applied: they should be like the hands of a fist until they are bound to the tooth with wire, lest they should themselves be torn or twisted: their handles should be short, and they should be made of iron or of forged steel, their handles directed toward the outside. And in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter into engagement with each other, and which bind the constriction loosely, but not too tightly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the extremities are of the shape of the beak of a bird which is called a ciconia, and are strong constrictions
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains after the removal of a tooth which has fractured something, then it is necessary to place butter over the place for one or two days, until the place is softened: then introduce an instrument to the tooth, or forceps whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird which is called a ciconia.</start_of_turn>
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is as follows.</start_of_turn>
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like the teeth of a saw: or like an awl.</start_of_turn
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, these forceps do not suffice for the extraction, then one must saw above the root and remove the whole tissue, and introduce the small spatula, which is of this shape.</start_of_turn
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Sit brief extremities, great parts near: and not drunk, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root goes out through that, it is good: and if not, to use these instruments with others of like shape is necessary
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first triangle of the extremities, in which there is some greatness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the slender triangle of the extremities.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it is used with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is like this
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and implements which precede in the ratio of the teeth
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And let the handling be with this instrument which assimilates one large, of this shape, triangular extremity of the twisted extremities, in which there is some greatness, so that it does not break: and let it not be drunk
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments of the teeth are many: and like the rest of the instruments they do not agree, and the prudent artist, skilled in his art, finds by himself the proper instrument for each operation and each disease
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For the ailments of which the ancients did not speak of an instrument, because of the diversity of their species
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the bone breaks from the mandible, or from any other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then to search upon it in its place with that which is convenient for it from among the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and to handle it with care, whose shape is like this
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	There is something of greatness in it gradually, so that it be stretched, or be held with the bone, and not flee and bend, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with the physicians who are convenient for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however in the bone there is a small putrescence, then remove the putrescence from the bone itself and care for it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Closure of the tooth above the others.
Caput XXXII.	The head is in the second position
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth do not follow their natural course, a fistula is formed in this way: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is in the gums.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore to take this into consideration
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has been born after another tooth and has not been placed, or if it is possible to suture it or to file it down: then extract it: and if it is united with another tooth, then remove it with this instrument which has this form
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small face and is made of iron, with acute extremities cold
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such as that which you make on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not damage any other teeth
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however the exposed part of the suture is prominent: then file it down with a file from iron, which has this form
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be all of iron, and the handle of it have small points of a similar shape to a file: with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that it does not damage the tooth and falls out: then smooth it, and finally close it with some rasps
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	And if a tooth from which a part has broken off and is injuring the tongue: then it is necessary to ligate it also, until the sharpness of that fracture is removed: and it will be flattened, and it will not injure the tongue, nor will it corrupt the speech
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the restoration of teeth with their golden [pins].
Caput XXXIII.	On the restoration of teeth with their golden [pins].
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When teeth are loosened before from concussion and displacement by blows, or in any case: and the patient is unable to bite properly, because of the pain: then wisdom dictates that they be bound down with gold wire: for silver is liable to become tarnished and putrefy after a few days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of medium thickness and of the size which will grasp between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the restoration is that you grasp the wire and pass a loop through two sound teeth: then you tie with two ends of the wire between the teeth which are loose, whether one or more, until you have secured them with the sound tooth of the other side
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	And repeat the process until you reach the part from which you began: and bind your hand with care and wisdom, until it does not move again: and let your tightening be such as to bind the wire firmly at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	And cut off the remaining ends of the wire with scissors: and gather each and bind them together, and close easily: and hide them between the sound tooth and the loosened tooth, so that it does not irritate the tongue: and then release the tension somewhat as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is dissolved or fractured, bind it with another wire, and it will be stable in this way for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the restoration of two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as if they were waters
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it is necessary, as when one or two teeth have become loosened after an injury, and are returned to their places as we have narrated, and remain: this does not happen except by a skilled, prudent, and experienced artificer.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	Whensoever anything is adapted from bones or pieces of bone: it becomes like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from whence teeth are nourished and bound together, as we have said: and remains, serving for as long a time as that.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the cutting of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and which forbids speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Whenever such a ligament happens under the tongue, it is either natural, as it is born with man, or accidental, from an injury which has solidified.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this is, that you open the diseased bone in his head in your hand, and lift up his tongue: then you cut through that nervous ligament across its width, until the tongue is freed from its retention
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything hard and nodulous in that, and if it is from the consolidation of an injury: then you must project into that bone, and find its breadth, until you cut through the ligament and the nodulus is freed
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Take care, that there be no fracture in the depth of the flesh, and that you do not cut the artery there, and that there be no flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it should be closed with a wash of rose-water, or with vinegar, or with cold water
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a bandage of linen, which will keep the patient firm throughout the night: so that it does not solidify again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however there is flow of blood, then put over the place a piece of sponge.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If however blood boils, then cauterize the place with a lancet, which is suitable for that: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	On the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When, under the tongue, a small swelling appears which is absorbed by the ranula, thereby hindering the natural action of the tongue: and perhaps it becomes so great that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	The operation in this case is to open the mouth of the patient alone: and to consider the swelling
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If, therefore, you see the swelling of a dusky or black colour, hard, which does not cause the patient any pain: do not touch it, for it is cancer
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then project into it with a fine sponge, and press it down with the thumb and index finger, and remove it from all around
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If, during the course of your operation, you see blood, then place over it a dry sponge which will absorb the blood: until the bleeding stops. Then return to your operation and extract the ranula along with its companion
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	And then it should be bathed with vinegar and salt: and take care of the rest of the treatment which is convenient for this case until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	¶ On the treatment of the swelling of two amygdala.
Caput XXXVI.	¶ On the treatment of the swelling of two amygdala
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When these appear between the tonsils, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which appear outside: and which are called two amygdalae: when you have treated them as we have said in the preceding chapter, and they do not heal, then consider it
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If the swelling is hard, of a dusky colour, with little sensation: do not touch it with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	If it is of a reddish colour and its root is large: then thou shalt not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather shalt thou let it alone until it has ripened.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	Then either thou shalt perforate it: or thou shalt rupture it of itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	If it is of a white colour, round, and its root is slight: then thou must cut it open.</start_of_turn>
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in it is this, as thou considerest before thy operation, if the after-pain of it remain quiet when completed, or if it threatens by any diminution: then thou must make the patient sit with his face towards the sun, and his head in thy lap: and open the opening of it, and take out the serum between thy hands, and bring down the tongue with an instrument, which has this form.</start_of_turn>
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Do it with silver, or with air, which is subtle like a knife.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When thou hast done this with the tongue, and the after-pain appears, and it has fallen upon thy hand: then grasp the instrument, and put it against the wound, and draw out the blood as much as possible, except that which thou draw with it from the tunics.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut the wound open with the instrument which has this form.</start_of_turn>
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	Thus it is like scissors: truly their extremities are curved, so that the opening of each of them is at a right angle to the other: where care must be taken lest it be of iron, or wetted with alum.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it open with a sponge, which has this form.</start_of_turn
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be acute from one side, not acute from the other side.</start_of_turn
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have incised one companion, incision the other according to the same kind of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	And afterwards the patient shall drink cold water, or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If blood flow should occur, he shall drink water in which there are boiled almond kernels: or leaves of myrtle, and the like of those from styptics, until the bleeding ceases: then care for him until he is healed
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there are left in the gut after the tonsils two other abscesses.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Incise these also according to what I have said concerning the incision of the two tonsils equally
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	I myself have treated a woman with an abscess which was born between her gums, which drew towards the jaw, with little sense, that is to say, it choked her: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and I forbade her from eating and drinking water: and she died within one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The abscess will only ascend as far as it sends out two branches, until it exits through two holes of the nose
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I bound them together with a single hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and from it there was a great portion.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	And I cut off the part where the abscess had been between the nostrils
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	And I treated the other part that was left between the nostrils
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue: and afterwards I bound the abscess with a hook: then I cut away from it the part which did not bleed much: immediately the woman's gut began to recover, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she ate food
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	The incision should not be made immediately from that large swelling, for it has lingered for a long time in its place.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	The swelling should therefore be cauterized between the intestines.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood still from the addition: then I went away from it, and I do not know what God did with it after that
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Regarding the incision of a large swelling.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the large swelling and becomes a swelling, and is long: then it is called a perpendicular incision: and if it is in the lower part and is large, it is called a round wound
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we said in the previous discussion, and the cure does not suffice: and the swelling has become soft and quiet from it: then it is necessary to make an incision for it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And whatever is gathered around it in a round shape, and does not have length, and is blood-stained, or of a dark color, or has no sensation: then it is necessary to make an incision for it
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in this case there is fear of the infirmity.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when the blood has become white, and of its length, so that you make sit the infirmity before the sun: and you grasp its tongue with the instrument of which I spoke before: then you fix the knot in the flesh and draw the blood downwards: and make an incision with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of two friends
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary not to make an incision from that which adds to the natural boundary without addition
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you make an incision from that which is beyond the natural limit, you will damage the bowels and the speech
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we mentioned in the incision of two amygdales: and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the patient returns sick from the incision: then it is necessary to use your skill in cauterization without fear or hesitation.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The manner of cauterization in these is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with that burnt lime, and put it not thick, neither thin, and press out from it the cavity of this instrument which has this shape
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	So that its extremities on which you put the medicine are rounded like the cavity of the cochlea of a radius
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon itself: and the patient lie upon his side, so that the mucus may run out from his mouth from inside the medicine, so that it does not descend from it to his gut and irritate him
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first put the thumb of your hand upon the quantity of medicine for a half hour, until you understand that it is softened, and rest the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to grasp the heel, and wrap it over the extremity of the radius, and tighten the heel with the medicine, and withdraw the radius with the heel through the hole, until the heel adheres to the itself
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this several times, until you have completed the cauterization of the vein
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then discharge the bandage: for it itself will swell and fall away in three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you think it is unnecessary, go again to the doctor: repeat the bandage. After cauterization, remove the surrounding skin with butter, and soften it with this which is in the vicinity of the medicine: and bind it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	The outside should be cared for with sutures, and the inside with gargles, until the wound is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Thus is a safer and more effective treatment than a long incision with fear of infection.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is also healed with the aid of smoke, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, hyssop, origanum, rue, sassafras, chamomile, and marjoram, and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and put the pot on a tripod over a hole in the middle of the pot, as it is customary
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver, or from air: and introduce the extremity, in which is the pomegranate seed, into the patient's bone, until the vapor reaches the wound above the cannula, until the wound is much obscured
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the bandage many times, until it is healed
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful, do not do this treatment at the beginning of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For in the abscess joy is added: and it is not necessary to do this except when the abscess is cold
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If, however, this instrument is not present, then take a needle and make a perforation in the extremity of the bone: so that it does not burn the bone: because the bark of the acacia tree prevents the vapor from burning the bone: and this is from a good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of thorns and bones from the gullet.
Caput XXXVIII.	On the extraction of thorns and bones from the gullet.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many thorns or bones of fish, or other things, adhere in the gullet.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract what is seen to be outside what has fallen away, after having placed the tongue with the instrument at the angle of the jaw, and to declare that it is in the gullet
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not seen by you and is hidden in the gullet, you must make the belly soft before the food is digested in the stomach
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps therefore the thing annexed will go out by itself.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or it will swallow a firm nut or the root of a lettuce, or will swallow a dry piece of bread, or will take a dry sponge of marine sponges: and bind it in a thread, and then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it has come to the place where the thorns or bones are, and they are extracted, then they are ejected.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If they do not come out with it, then use an instrument of lead in this shape
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	It should be thicker than the Radius parumper, and at its end there should be a curve which enters the gullet with ease: and let it have its head raised upwards
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And be careful of its touch of its epiglottis, so that it does not cause it to cough, and drive with it the bone or thorn, or let the doctor put it in with his hand
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the sick person has swallowed itself, that is better: because of its knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and drives downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that is prepared for it, until it comes out
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of the blood clot.
Caput XXXIX.	On the extraction of the blood clot.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the blood clot has been medicated with what I have said in the section on the evacuation of purulent matter with the physicians, and it does not yield, then consider in the belly of the patient below the sole, or near the heel after you have grasped the tongue with the instrument which I have mentioned to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your thumb slips from the blood clot, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps from the centre
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If this is not possible with the hook: then grasp a blunt needle and introduce it into the belly of the patient near the belly: then introduce into the concavity of the needle a burning iron with fire
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and the patient abstain from all water throughout the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he shall receive a complete treatment of cold water, and open his mouth with it: and keep his mouth closed with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and drink water an hour after each meal with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The blood clot will go away soon when it feels the water falling from it
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not go away when we have done what we have said, then suffocate the patient with sponges, or with an instrument as in the suffocation of a dog
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for it will go away by itself
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the way of performing the suffocation is that you take all the jars which have dates with fire: and the jars are covered with a cover, in which is a hole: and join together in that hole the extremity of the instrument.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw away the suffocation and place the patient's mouth at the extremity of the tube, and close the mouth, so that it does not escape the suffocation, until you know that the suffocation has passed to the blood clot.</start_of_turn>
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	The wound bleeds immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not bleed, repeat the packing more often.</start_of_turn>
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	The patient can tolerate sitting, and he can eat onions, garlic, and does not drink water.</start_of_turn
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary for him to go out with this regimen.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the way the instrument is used to extract blood from the gut when it bleeds over the inside of the belly.</start_of_turn
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like pincers, such as tweezers: except that it has the property of penetrating the gut.</start_of_turn
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its handle is like the beak of a heron, in which there is the roughness of lime: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it.</start_of_turn
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	About the opening of the bowels, and their section, and care in general.</start_of_turn
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.</start_of_turn>
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of apostemata, of many kinds, according to the nature of the reminder of them, that is to say, some are perforated, and some are sectioned in two ways.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One kind of apostematom is the one which arises from humidity.</start_of_turn
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The other kind is because of the place where it occurs in the body.</start_of_turn
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an apostematom that occurs in the head is different from an apostematom that occurs in the leg: and an apostematom that occurs in a fleshy place is different from an apostematom that occurs in a joint: and each one of them has its own judgment concerning the operation.</start_of_turn
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	Neither from the apostemata are those things which should not be pierced until after the maturity of health in the body, and their completion: and from the body are those things which should be pierced while they are crude, and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like the apostemata which are close to the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when the apostema happens close to a joint, and it lengthens, it may putrefy because of the surrounding parts, and perhaps corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint: which is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or the apostema is upon the main limb: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will bite or swell or become gangrenous in that main limb
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near some other part, perforate it immediately: for it should not be pierced while crude, not completed, except that which is near some other part, for otherwise it will putrefy deeply and extend towards the inward parts, and form a fistula, or become unhealed at its end
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the apostema, which is matured according to its completion: and it is with the cessation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulse, and the acuteness of the head of the apostema: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary that you make the perforation in the lower part of the apostema, and of more prominence: and let the perforation be wide in length throughout the body, if the apostemata are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of lacerations, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places equally, where there is no reflection
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	And in those which reflect, be cautious with the perforation concerning that limb
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the afterbirth has reached its proper place in the carinae: then it is better to suspend the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we have stated according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Since if you perforate it before that, the course of the liquor from it is prolonged, and there is much mucus and pus, and possibly the lips of it are swollen, and its depth is increased.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some afterbirths are perforated according to the width of the body at necessity: or according to that which is necessary for the limb.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	It is necessary to administer in small afterbirths a small perforation, and in large afterbirths a wide perforation: or multiple sections according to the size of the afterbirth.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some afterbirths in which it is necessary to suture the skin: and this is done when it has been made like a piece of cloth, and when it has been made at the end, which is when it is dead: as is the case with many, as with the mole and the abscess
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are some which are sectioned with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there are some which are like the shape of the leaf of myrtus
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like a belly afterbirth
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are some in which a round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar sections are like these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	This, however, which has no head, like the superficial afterbirths, should be perforated with a superficial perforation, or only slightly.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the afterbirth is large, and there is much clotted blood collected, to perforate it so that it does not swell and discharge the whole pus in an hour: rather remove from it a part of it immediately
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then the ointment is applied to the boil until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this often according to the degree [of severity]: especially if the patient is feeble of virtue, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man in decrepitude: for the spirit of the animal is dissolved from the body with the evacuation of the corruption, and perhaps the patient may die, and you may not perceive it
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take heed of this chapter, for it contains great caution
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have pierced the boil, which you have pierced, it is necessary to drain the wound: and consider it
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If there is a small wound in the boil, or if it is a flat section, then administer lead from white lead, or burnt alum.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large boil, and there are many holes of perforation, then you must introduce into every hole a little lead, until they reach the innermost part
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have excised a part of the skin from the boil, or if you have cauterized the circumference of the boil: then you must apply to it an old piece of cloth, or like when a bandage is taken off, or cover it with wool without moisture: and bind it until the third day
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it and care for it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if there should happen to be a flow of blood in your hour of operation, then administer cold water, and vinegar, after they have been drunk in wine: and put it over the place of the flow of blood many times over
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	And if the flow of blood should persist, then you must administer regimen and care, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is in the time of the snows, and the seat of the afterbirth is of many nerves: then it is necessary to infuse the wounds with wine and oil of warmth: and to place them over the place.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	If, however, it is in summer, and the place is fleshy: then it is necessary to place soaked sponges in water, or oil, or both wine and oil, and all this cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must drain the afterbirth, and evacuate it, and administer to him what is proper for him until he is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of afterbirths in general
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the rule of the science, as I have said of every afterbirth, how it is necessary to proceed to the treatment of it individually
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Of the sections of the afterbirths which happen in the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small afterbirths happen in the head, and are of the kind of knots which contain tunica, which are like little bags: as if they were the gallstones of a goose
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	There are some which are fat: and there are those which contain moisture like slime: and those which contain moisture like fresh butter and cheese: and those which are like stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as during their section it does not make an injury to the arteries
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is, as you will learn with the instrument which comes after these, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	If there is moisture remaining, then dry it out with a section equal to the length of the superficial section: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	If moisture remains, then dry it out with a section equal to the length of the superficial section: according to this fashion.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	And begin from the line b to line g. When the moisture has gone, then scrape out the tumour which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything behind.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the limb in unguent of Egypt, if there is any: or in water and salt: and anoint with oil, and leave it until tomorrow.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	The moisture will be dissolved by the ointment.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the limb with Egypt three times: and if you think that there is still something remaining from the tumour, then indeed continue to anoint with oil until you are confident that nothing remains of the tumour, then indeed take care of the wound with ointment until it has healed
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If there is a fatty node remaining: then dry it out according to this fashion, with a section having the shape of a cross: and stretch out the skin between the two angles of the section, and scrape it off from all sides: and attempt your skill in extracting the tunic which contains it
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it opposes you, the artery: then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do the same with a stone tumour, from the section, and the treatment is the same as before
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over a stone tumour is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some head tumours in certain people, in which there is no moisture at all
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	What is this? Because I saw behind the ear of a woman of mature years, and I found the ear like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it is pierced with anything, it will wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other cases, however, with regard to the ears, it is necessary to know that besides these, there are also other ears which occur in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the section of these is superficial.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or one must always pierce them from the lower part downwards, so as to avoid injury to the course of the blood to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	And then take care of it as seems best to you concerning the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	(The text continues with the next section of the translation.)
Caput XLII.	(The section header is omitted for brevity.)
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many of these ear-related ailments occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes also in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those which occur in the neck, there is one kind and many: and they all arise from a single source: and every strophe originates from its own sheath, just as is the case with the knots and the ears of the head, as we have mentioned.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these strophes.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And these strophes are of various kinds: some are soft, some contain moisture, and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, whenever a good-looking liquid which has a distinct colour and which moves throughout and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, the veins or the arteries, and is not deep: it is necessary to section it superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, be it a straight line or a curved line, and to excise it from every part: and to spread two layers of skin with a single fold, or with many folds, if you deem it necessary, as we said concerning the ears of the head, and to extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	It is very cautious to avoid injury to the bone or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	It is not proper to make the incision too acute lest you should thereby damage the hand with the incision, or cause unnecessary discomfort to the patient.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you must make an incision into bone or a blood vessel, you should first place in the wound a pledget of sponges or some powdered material which absorbs blood, and then tighten the wound and let the patient rest until the pain has subsided and the wound has healed: or you will risk causing gangrene.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is driven away by tension. Return therefore to your work when you are ready to do so
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire your finger with your index finger, if anything remains of the other small bones: then make an incision easily and cleanse it thoroughly
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If it is in the root of the phalanx there is a large bone: then you must take care not to make an incision from the root: rather must you bind it with a strong doubled thread, and let it go when it has fallen off without damage
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then moisten the wound with Egyptian unguent which you have previously applied.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the phalanx is completely fractured, then you must join together the two lips of the wound: and hold them in place immediately after you have washed because otherwise there will remain excessive swelling
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you find that there is still swelling remaining because of the size of the phalanx, then you must make an incision at the root of the bone and extract the bone: and administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what is contained in the phalanx must be moistened, perforate it with a superficial incision: so that you may see the place of its maturity: and put the perforation below that which follows from the belly, as we have said
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until when you see the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed.
Caput XLIII.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then manage after perforation the lymph with unguent, and like this with other things, until the wound has been healed: then care for the body with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then the secret of the incision which we have mentioned: it signifies above the section of the canal from the phlegm which issues from it, when that which is ruptured is severed, and the cutting of the part.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound be closed at a suitable time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the matter has settled at the hour when the stitching is to be made, gather together the two lips of the wound in the skin, and sew them only with the substance itself, without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow, until it is healed
Inquit Albucasis.	Thus spoke Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	This is the end of the text.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I have seen myself: a handmaid took a knife and put it into her own gut, and it went through a part of the lung canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to care for her, and I found her already dead, like a dead person
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I saw that the wound had been made, and I found blood which had flowed out of the wound of the arm
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was confused, for neither did she cut nor guide: and the wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated her accordingly, and bandaged the wound, and cared for her until she was healed: and the handmaid never did anything except groan in the water: and she recovered after a few days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Henceforth I say: there is no fear in the Epiglottis section.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Regarding the guttural hernia section.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.</start_of_turn>
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling is called a hernia gutturis, and is a large swelling, according to the colour of the body: and it is very common in women.</start_of_turn>
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And there are two kinds: either it is natural: or it is accidental.</start_of_turn
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural kind there is no root cause.</start_of_turn
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental kind, however, is of two kinds: one of which is like a swelling of fat nodules.</start_of_turn
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	The other kind is like a swelling that arises from a knot in an artery.</start_of_turn
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is fear, and it is not right to assume it with force, except in the case where it is small: and you must prove it and examine it with an instrument.</start_of_turn
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it like a fat knot, and it is not associated with any other swelling: then dry it up, just as you would a knot: and extract what is contained within the swelling, if there is any within: and if not, then examine the whole of it.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Regarding the section concerning the various kinds of nodules.</start_of_turn
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.</start_of_turn
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have mentioned all of them in the preceding discourse: and it is necessary to know the difference between a Node and an Excretion, in case of doubt.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, when the extraction is completed, heat, fever, and pain subside until the excess of humours has settled down, and corruption is complete: then indeed does fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the node is gone, neither heat, nor fever, nor pain remain, and there is only a slight swelling of the bag which is the natural sac, which is according to the colour of the body: and this is the beginning of their disappearance, and it makes them swell like a batrach, being both greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	They are of two kinds: either fat or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	The colours of moisture are many, as I said in the explanation
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you are treating the node, to experience it, and to inquire about it first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, according to the form of its kind which will be described later
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the way of inquiry afterwards, and of all nodes in general, is that you take hold of this instrument, and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the apostem: and you gradually withdraw your fingers until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then finally you must take your hand according to the measure of the size of the apostem.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out through its hole
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore fluid runs out, whatever be its colour: then dry it with a superficial section, as I said in the other apostemata
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	If not, you know that it is fat: then dry it with a section having the shape of a cross, according to its form, like I have taught you: and suspend it with wires, and remove the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the bag if you can see fat above it, until you have extracted it whole with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the bladder is ruptured during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, many things then happen, for in such a case one must extract it broken, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	Or if anything at all remains of it, little or much, it returns to the Node according to the greatest number.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If you prick it, and something remains of it: then take a sponge dipped in corrosive powders and apply it to the completion of your work: and bind the sponge, and place above it what rests upon the fat cushion, and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a great Node, then two of its lips must be taken, and care must be taken with that which is contained in it
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein nearby: then straighten it out, and place a ligature at the root, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the sponge softens and the blood-clotting subsides: then return to the matter remaining from the Node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	As for the instruments outside for the cutting and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three forms of instruments which enter the body.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	The large, the medium, and the small forms are all of them from the body.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron with blunt squares at the extremities, so that they may hasten the entrance into the fat cushion.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the instruments which are for experience, that is, for perforation: and one of them is called a needle, that is, a piercer, and there are three kinds of them
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From the inside, the great, the medium, and the small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	The great, the medium, and the small are all within the inside.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are circular, triangular, lenticular, like a large needle that travels under the skin, from citrine, or air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	The best of these are those that are made from citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	Experience also teaches us lead black which joins with these things so that through them we can perceive fistulas, whose reflections are like the reflections of glass with their smoothness.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are three kinds of these things.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Since they are from the inside, they are long from the inside, medium from the inside, and short from the inside, according to the quantity of the diameter of the fistula and the tightness of it
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of the needles and there are many kinds of them
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Since they are from the inside, they are simple, that is to say that they have only one curve: and there are three kinds like liquids, great, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from the inside there are blind neighbors: and there are three kinds of them
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from the inside there are needles having two curves, and there are three kinds of them: and from the inside there are needles having three curves, and there are three kinds of them: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, which cut and scrape nodes and abscesses: and there are three kinds of them, since they are from the inside they are great, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their acute extremities are those which make the cut, the other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed like this, except when the inside is being cauterized with the tip of the knife, or the nerve: and in order to heal the patient and to bring peace to the wound rather than by increasing the damage caused by the incision of the abscess
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magdae, and there are three kinds of them.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	These are Magdae, and there are three kinds of them. They are made of air, and are similar to Radio, with which alcohol is made: and at their wide end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in it runs to the interior and exterior as desired, like a stream.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of Spatumila which is driven between the fingers at the perforation of the apostematum: and they do not perceive them the sick: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Air bubbles which when they are blown away cause the flow of blood to be cut off: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of air, or citrons, round, to a length somewhat like that of a stream: and they are sharp.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of bubbles should be with you, large and small: in order to cut off the blood as quickly as necessary, and then when there is no physician present
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But do not use them for the cutting off of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in places where there is carnation: such as wounds of the leg, and hip, and wounds of the forearm, and breast, and belly, and groin, and similar wounds, from carnation, moisture.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made from other small things like the cortices of fists, according to their form: with which the blood is cut off when it flows out of the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made from round things according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Of the care of the breasts of men which absorb the milk of women.
Caput XLVII.	Head XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some people swell up alongside sleep (that is, when they begin to secrete in sleep), until they become like those of women: and remain after sleep has ended.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes this, must cause the secretion to stop by cutting across the breast with a crescent-shaped blade, following this line, a. along the line, c. Then remove the fat thoroughly from the wound
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then apply a piece of lint soaked in medicine to the wound
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And finally close the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it has healed
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the breast leans downwards and is softened because of its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary to make two incisions like the one described above, one in each of the two upper parts, so that one overlaps the other at the edges, until the larger line contains the smaller one, following this line, a. along the line, g. Then remove the skin which is between the two lips, and take away the fat, and perform what has been said concerning the sutures and powders, which are necessary for the healing, until it has healed
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however one does not wish to make the incision which is necessary, because of the patient's anxiety or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary to apply a poultice soaked in corrosive unguent to the bottom of the wound, and leave it, until that which remains of the fat has been corroded.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And care for it until it has healed
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	As for the perforation of the apostemas, which happens under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	When the breast has been opened up as has been described above, and the milk has been drawn out, and the fat has been removed from the wound, and the wound has been sutured, and the powders have been applied as has been said: if the wound is not closed carefully, or if it is left open, or if it is infected, or if there is excessive bleeding: all these things will cause the wound to become infected.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	The after-effects which happen under the Titillico are from a kind of hard Strophulus which contains vesicles, and from these arise the humilities.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	These are from hard vesicles which contain humilities.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	It must be excised with a lunar section, in this shape, from line b to line g, as when all that is in the after-effect from the bowels is evacuated, then immediately fill the cavity with wool, and keep it until the next day.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the after-effect be from a knot of the Strophulus kind, then split over it as we said concerning the Strophulus which is equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however there proceeds a swelling in this which brings forth pus, then apply cautery in it, as we said before concerning this thing.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Of the excision of the after-effect which happens through the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the Artery is ruptured, and the skin which is above it is consolidated, then many times an after-effect happens from it: and in the same way an after-effect happens from the Vein also, as it happens in this with the after-effect and swelling
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the after-effect and swelling are from the Artery and Vein are: for when the after-effect is from the Artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body: and when the after-effect affects the fingers of the hand, you feel as if there is a strangulation in it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is from the Vein is round in the open body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	The excision of this after-effect is an error, especially when it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great danger
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that his care should be delayed with regard to fire, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, should be delayed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, since it is from inflation of the artery that it is found in the middle section in length
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is detached
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce under these the point of the awl, and make the artery penetrate until the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as you have been taught in the excision of two arteries in the flanks
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then close the place where two ligatures are made with sponge, until the blood which is in it has gone out, and the swelling is dissolved
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall away: afterwards care for this with the dressings which are suitable for this, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there is swelling on account of the section of a vein, then you must keep your hand as much as possible from the swelling with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the awl under the place where you have kept your hand, and make the hole penetrate: and be in it a doubled thread, until you have extracted it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with itself the swelling with a good ligature: according to what I have told you concerning the ligation of a vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you are afraid that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another awl with another thread under the whole swelling at the incision of the needle: before that, and tie your thread in four places
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the swelling in its middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut off the superfluous skin, and let go what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place above it the little pulse which you submerged in the wine, and the sponge.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment, which is done with poultices and unguents, until he is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	As for a wound caused by the twisting of nerves
Caput L.	It is the head of the Little One
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Like that which happens in the artery and the vein, in the same way it happens in nerves: for it happens in a blow to the head, or from excessive labor, or in like manner: and it often happens in the armpits, or at the heel, or in any place where there is a joint: and it is a serious wound
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It is like the color of the rest of the body, and it is in various positions without pain: and when it is squeezed with pressure, it feels like drunkenness in it
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	It is not a deep wound of the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not go forward, or backward, or downwards.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Because it is from a blow, it must not be sutured with iron
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps there will be a contraction
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is from a blow to the head, or to the face, find the skin with the spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small wound, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a thread, and scrape it off: then take it away, and mix it with oil: and care for it, until it is healed
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	As for the section of a wound in the belly
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some men suffer from numerous wounds in various parts of their bodies, and in the remainder of their bodies they have things which are like fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their roots are slight, their heads are large, and their edges are slimy.</start_of_turn>
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	They are like little plants which grow tall.</start_of_turn>
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I saw a man who had two of these things in his belly, which were larger than any others of their kind: there was no difference between them, white or yellow, as regards the root, and they were soft and sticky.</start_of_turn>
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I saw a man who had two of these things in his belly, which were larger than any others of their kind. There was no difference between them, white or yellow, as regards the root, and they were soft and sticky.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Many are expelled from the section of its blood much: therefore if blood incites thee, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If thou seest a sickly and timid patient from the incision with the iron, then take a leaden weight, made in the center, and bind it with wool about it: which is the way which we have said, and dismiss it on the two following days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add in stricture lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to bind the lead, whenever thou seest it pressed in the wound, until it be severed, and falls away without toil
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the wound be great of the root, then in its incision there is something of fear and weakness: especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is true that thou can cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it do not return
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it, until the wound be healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And take heed lest thou presume to cut through the wound which is of a pale colour, little sense, bad aspect: for it is a tumor of cancer: and I will remind thee of cancer after this
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	About the care of the belly wound.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The belly wound proceeds from many ulcers.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from rents in the bowels which are above the belly: and issues from this either the gut, or the intestine, according as it happens in other ruptures
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, as it is aforesaid.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from swelling which is closed in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	Or if it is because of a wound of the bowels, and there is an escape of the intestines: then the colour is like that of faeces: it is soft, without pain: and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	Or if it is because of the discharge of the intestines, then the place of its origin is with that which we have mentioned, of great diversity of places.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you touch it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it becomes much greater at the entrance of the bath, and the work that is done is great
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	Or if it is because of humidity, it is soft: then it is not hidden when you touch it with your hand, neither does it constrict, nor does it adhere
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Or if it is because of blood, then it appears like black spots.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	Or if it is because of rotten flesh: then it is a dark, thick, hard swelling, and it forms according to the quantity of one
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	Or if it is because of swelling, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in this is, as you must consider, if the swelling of the navel is because of blood of an artery, or a vein, or swelling: then you must abstain from its care
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in this there is fear and danger, as you were taught in the chapter where I said that swelling caused by an artery or a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	Or if the swelling of the navel is because of the intestines or the spleen: then you must push out the patient, as much as he can bear, and let him rest extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with incisions around the whole belly.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to rest between your hands over his back
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a wide spatula around the belly in the place where you made the incisions
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then stretch the middle of the incision upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it firmly around with thread or silk cord: and let the knot of the ligation be firm.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the incision which has been stretched upwards beyond the ligament.</start_of_turn
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find it grasped by the ligament: then draw out the loop and bring it into the finger index, and push the intestine inwards towards the belly: and if you find a bladder, then grasp it with a hook, and cut off its excess.</start_of_turn
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the contrary is the case, that is to say an artery or a vein: then encircle it much.</start_of_turn
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your work.</start_of_turn>
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and bring them through two strong threads: and bring two needles around the circumference which you made around the incision in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the belly in four places on the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls away by itself: or cut it off when it becomes thin and putrefies.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound as you deem necessary until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	And if there is a swelling of the belly from meat or from moisture: then it is necessary to make the incision deeper as we have said.</start_of_turn
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract blood, or moisture, as you find it in this.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	And then care for the place with it which solidifies the location.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	And care for the wound
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken concerning the kind of cancer, and how it is to be treated by physicians: and caution must be taken with its treatment with iron, lest it should ulcerate: and it has been said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and that its care must be cautious
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	The ancients have also said that when cancer is in a place where it can be extirpated, such as cancer of the breast or the hip, and those which are like these, from the limbs which can be excised throughout: especially when it is just beginning to grow small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it grows old, and is great, it is not proper to approach it
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I am unable to cure anyone from it: neither can any other before me
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in this, when it is located as we have said, is to precede it, and to dissolve the disease with black bile several times
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	And then perform a bloodletting if you find it with a manifestation of repletion.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	And then prepare the patient for the preparation in which the operation is to be performed
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	And then remove from the cancer the nails which agree with it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then concave it from all parts with the skin, according to the inscription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow freely, and do not cut it quickly, but express the place, and evacuate all the thick blood, or as much as possible with the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the procedure should cause a large flow of blood from an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the rest of the treatment until healing is complete.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	(The translation of the remaining text is not provided.)
Caput LIIII.	(The heading is not translated.)
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We shall explain in detail the species of hydrosis and how water is aggregated: and the signs of each kind, and the treatment with the physicians.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is not except the single species of ascites: and it is not approached with iron the species of tympanitis: neither the species of deep-seated dropsy: for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are treated for this species of hydrosis of the tympani with the physicians, and your treatment has not been of use: then consider that.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if there is associated with the hydrosis weakness, or that there is another sickness with her besides the hydrosis: such as with her with cough, or solution of the intestines, and the like: then do not treat her with iron for fear of that
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see the patient exultant with pleasure, neither is there with her except the sole sickness besides the hydrosis: neither young nor old: then the mode of treatment in her is that you lift the patient up between your hands, and express from her belly her urine downwards to the lower part of the belly
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sponge of spines, according to this fashion
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Two sharp parts, long, with acute extremities like a sponge.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Indeed there is something of shortness of breath gradually, so that it does not pass through with her at the operation until the intestines, and does not wound her
Deinde considera.	Then consider it.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	Therefore consider it.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of hydrosis is because of the liver's ailment: then let your left incision be from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	If indeed the generation of that is because of the spleen: then let the incision be on the right side: and it should not be on the side which you intend to place the sickly person, lest there be excessive flow to the place of weakness.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	And then pierce with the instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	And then introduce into that incision your hand with the sponge between the skin, and scrape, as if you are scraping yourself: and let the amount which you scrape be as much as the amount of nails, or somewhat less
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	And then pierce the sponge, until the sponge reaches the empty place: and that is the place of water
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	And then extract it, and introduce into the opening the instrument which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or gold, or ivory, flexible, thin: which has in its lower part a small hole, and in its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its extremity is cut, in the manner of a knife, like urine: at its upper extremity is an armilla
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately sinks above the instrument, so that the urine flows out of the water in an hour the quantity of a middle finger.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from that more than is necessary, in an hour the sickly person may die from the resolution of the spirit of his animal: or there may happen to him a fainting which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from that according to the quantity of his virtue, and according to what you understand of the sickly person from the virtue of his pulse, and from his condition
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Then extract the instrument and retain the water immediately because of the skin which retains the orifice above the sac: as I have mentioned, so that you may perforate it according to the proper method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if the patient can tolerate it: and extract also from the water the quantity that has remained.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this on several days without fear, and take care of yourself from error: until there remains from the water only a little bit.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear the patient, and you discharge from the water a great quantity: then take care of him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweating in a bath and in the sun, and expect above the seat: and take care of him with physicians who are skilled in surgery, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the spleen, and the liver, after the water has been extracted, according to what I have mentioned before
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	As for the care of infants who are born in places where the bladder is not perforated.
Caput LV.	(The text ends abruptly here.)
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone has gone out of the womb of his mother, and the head of his neck is not perforated, or is slightly closed, or is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to assist with the perforation of it immediately when it is born with a fine needle, according to this form
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the opening a small lead claw, and bind it: and keep it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it wants to urinate, remove the claw and mix it in
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	If you do not put in the plug, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice is strict, it is treated with a plug, as we have said before, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	If the orifice is not in its proper place, they are pained
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because the opening comes out at the end of the bladder: so it cannot reach forward until it has raised the bladder upwards
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Neither is there any generation [of sperm] because the seed cannot pass beyond the matrix in a straight line: and this is a grievous pain
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	The way to treat this is to support the sick person on his back
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the bladder with your left hand and stretch out the neck of the bladder from the root of the penis with an acute angle: as if you are cutting off a reed or as if you are grasping a radish, so that the middle of the bladder comes to be like the head of the bladder: and that the opening be in the middle as it should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And take care that you avoid blood flow during your operation
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens to them.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Offer him something which will bind the blood, and care for the wound until it has healed
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning the injuries which occur in the prepuce and the head of the bladder, and the corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many of these injuries occur in the bladder, and are caused by the prominence of the diseased tissue.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	Some of these are harmful, while others are not harmful.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	It is not harmful to suspend them with a fine thread and cut them off when they are clean.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put over the wound a soaked bandage in Egyptian unguent.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with fine unguent until it heals.</start_of_turn
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If Albucasis is harmful, black pus, then it is necessary to apply cautery after its incision and to its cause.</start_of_turn
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, Albucasis is in the belly of a captive, not circumcised, and is part of Albucasis both inside and outside: then it is necessary to ligate Albucasis which is inside first, until it is consolidated, and then care for the outside: for when you care for the outside at the same time, the belly will split.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And sometimes also in testicles, and black swelling and corruption.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is necessary therefore that you drain away all that is decayed and which you wish to corrupt, or which is already corrupted.</start_of_turn
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then smear over it afterwards with honey which has been consumed with ground wheat and crushed thyme leaves.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however blood flows, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, in this form.</start_of_turn
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	Cautery is useful in two positions at the same time, that is, for blood flow and for a wound when it is corrupted.</start_of_turn
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of a beard has been burnt and is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead into the beard flesh, so that the diseased part may adhere to it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	If the beard has been burnt and is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead into the beard flesh, so that the diseased part may adhere to it.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If the case is doubtful, then it is necessary to lance something from the beard and from the beard-hair.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	The beard-hair is easily broken by its slightness or by speed
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the beard from the beard-hair, and the head of the beard with a fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they will not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then keep it with vinegar until it is solidified.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Of the care of children, and of the treatment of an error by an accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the complete solution to an ongoing problem, like other wounds: indeed, when it comes to our present operation, which is voluntary, and the patient is a child, it is necessary to indicate in this operation the greatest possible care, and the least possible discomfort for the patient.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their laws, and it is not except for what we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	For I have found that the greatest part of physicians, and of phlebotomists, use circumcision in various ways: with a needle, and with scissors: and they use it for bleeding, and bind with thread, and cut with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I too have proved that all these methods are useful, and I have not found anything better than them with scissors and thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in cutting with a needle, the skin flees much more readily.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin has two layers: thus sometimes the upper skin is split, and the lower layer is threatened: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to split the other one, and to relieve the pain of the future
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when a wound is made by the nails, as surgeons do, the incision of the extremity of the limb is not secure: for perhaps it penetrates the hole of it
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But when the wound is made by a nail, perhaps the iron will break, and corrupt your operation: and the skin of a child is short in nature, and many are produced like this, which does not suffice for a wound: and I know of that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But as for cutting with scissors, and ligation with thread, I have proved that this is a good experiment: for the scissors are proportional to the incision: thus the greater the sharpness that is above, the greater is the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you therefore handle the hand, the two sharpness are proportional, and they cut according to the operation of one at the same time: and there is a like compression of the figure, containing the skin of the limb from every side, so that no error occurs at all
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper way of operating is, to make the incision and immediately ligate the thread in the limb: and dismiss the patient until the next day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that you can, from this moment on, because of the knowledge that he has received
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands prepared to a standard height, and let him not sit: and conceal the instruments in your sleeve or under your foot, so that no one shall see them at all, neither any instrument.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then put your hand into the patient's body, and blow into the skin, and draw it up until the head of the patient is expelled
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then wipe away that which is gathered in that cavity.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind below with a piece of ligament as much as the ligament above
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then take hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament with good retention, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then raise the skin up quickly and extract the head of the patient
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow out slowly (for it is better thus) and put down powder: and put on a bandage above the powder on which the expanding testicle or decocted testicles in rose-water are broken with fresh rose-water: and leave it on until another day: and take care of the rest of the treatment until the patient is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the instrument for these incisions is as follows
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There are two handles at both ends, and there are two blades: do not let the nails escape from the claw: and let the length of the two be equal to the length of two thumbs together
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The mistake often happens in incisions: for perhaps the skin covering the whole inside escapes at the incision, or a part of it.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend your hand with your finger before making the incision at the place: and make the incision according to the equality
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you are unable to keep the limb with your thumb, then extract it with the index finger and cut it off.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If it remains swollen under the nail for three days, and the swelling does not subside, amputation: then dismiss that, until the swelling becomes soft, and remove it easily, and cut it off as is usual for you: and be cautious from the head of the nail.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not be painful for him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Handle it with that which consolidates the nail, as we have mentioned in the treatise on nails: and if it escapes from the skin above the measure, and goes upwards, it does not harm him even so
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Handle it with that which we have mentioned, until it is healed.

Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder arises from a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, or similar things which we have mentioned in the section on treatment.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not become loose, and the retention is because of a stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary to make him lie with his knee bent over his knee
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then compose his feet over his back, and extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and tighten his windpipe as much as possible for him
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	He considers thus when the neck of the bladder is towards the expulsion of the stone backwards: then the urine is expelled
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	And if it does not become loose as we have mentioned, and the thing is serious: then it is necessary to administer the extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which is made of silver, is subtle, flexible, curved like a feather quill in the thickness of a palm of the hand, with a fine tube at the head of it.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way out of the vein is through itself, so that you grasp a doubled thread and bind it at its extremity to a lan or cot, a good ligation: and introduce the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Syringae: and cut with scissors if anything remains from the lan, truly introduce it into the cannula with certainty, as is done for an alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then immerse the Syringae with oil, or butter, and alum, and make the patient sit on a seat, and embalm the wound, and cover the wound with moist oils, and oil of olive, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the Syringae into the wound with ease, until it reaches the root of the wound.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the above from the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the Syringae inside itself, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has gone to the bottom: and do not do this except according to this order, except in the case where the wound, in which it goes, is tortuous
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with lan slowly.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The vein follows the lan.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw out the thread, and make the vein run through the urine: and repeat the Syringae, and do not cease doing this until the wound is evacuated and the patient feels relief
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of the urine with Clepshydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When it happens in the bladder that there is a wound, or the blood is frozen in it, or is coarsened in it by pus, and the urine is distilled into water and medicines: then make use of an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	The ear is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	There are three holes in it, two from one side and one from the other, like veins.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	The cavity where that which drives it is situated should be according to the quantity of what is useful for it without addition, until when it is pulled with something else, something is drawn from the moistures: and when it is driven out, when it is expelled at length: according to what makes the clap of urine, which is projected from pitch, that is, Greek fire in the marshes of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When thus one wishes to project the moistures into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clap of urine into the moisture, and draw with it that which drives it to the upper parts, for the moisture is drawn into the cavity of the clap of urine
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the bladder, as we said concerning the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive out the moisture with that which drives it and indeed the moisture immediately follows the bladder, as it feels the sick person
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Thus makes a soft enema which is instilled into the bladder.</start_of_turn>
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	It is made from silver or gold: whose head is higher like a small bowl, and under it there is a space between which the ligament passes.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then grasp the bladder of a sheep, and put in it the moisture which one wishes to instill in the bladder.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind the two spaces together with a strong ligature with a double thread: and heat up the moisture slightly over fire.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the enema into the bladder, afterwards draw your hand over the bladder with the moisture firmly bound down, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.</start_of_turn
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, the bladder is not present, then take a piece of gut and form a circle from it, and perforate it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread firmly into these holes, as they curve around
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as is done with alum. When you have placed in it what you wish of moisture, and oil, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it in an instrument: and make with it as with the bladder when expressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	(The text continues with instructions on extracting a stone from the bladder.)
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.</start_of_turn>
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the discourse concerning the species of stones, and their treatment by physicians: and we have spoken of the difference between a stone generated in the bowels and the bladder, and the signs of the former: and we have spoken of the stone in which the operation is performed with the hand and incision: and this is a stone generated in the bladder itself: and that which appears in the urine: and I will narrate this with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the stone generated in the bladder, most frequently happens to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its consistency: and there appears in it white sand, and it irritates the soft parts of the urine, and causes them to swell, and often hangs up
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises up, and comes out with the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is easy to heal the children of this, up until the age of fourteen years
Et est difficilis in senibus.	It is difficult in old age.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in youth it is middle-aged, in that which it is between these two: and its lapis is greater, its cure is easier: and if it is slight, it is more sparing of that care.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the treatment, it is necessary in the first place to evacuate the patient with a purgative, which draws out all the stool that is in the intestines: for this indeed often hinders the discovery of the lapis at the inquiry.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient is taken with his feet, and is shaken, and moved downwards: so that the lapis may go down to the bottom of the bladder, or go out from its high place in some other way.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your two hands prepared, and your hands are under his buttocks, so that the bladder may be completely emptied downwards
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then ask him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the lapis in the place, then act immediately with a section above it
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not come under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger with the left hand if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if he is an adult: and introduce it into his rectum, and ask about the lapis, until it is under your finger: and bring it slowly to the neck of the bladder
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards against the place where the incision is to be made: and command the minister who is on the right to grasp the bladder with his hand, and command another minister to stretch out the testicles with his left hand: and the third hand to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is to be made
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the sponge carefully into the cavity, which is of this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	Then insert the sponge carefully into the cavity, which is of this shape. Find what is between the testicles and the navel, and not in the middle, to the left of the navel: and let the incision be above the highest stone, and your finger on the anus: make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision is narrow, according to the quantity which will allow the stone to pass from it without greater difficulty.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger that is in the anus will grasp the stone at the incision and it will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that the stone has angles and edges, which makes its exit difficult on account of these
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is soft like a gland and round: and it makes its exit easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore let there be angles and edges added to the incision
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out like this, then you must know that you must bring the thumb over the top: or grasp it with your hand which is hanging loosely, whose tip is like the moon which grasps the stone and does not slip from it: or that you insert under it an instrument which is slightly curved at its tip
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you are unable to do these things, then widen the opening a little more
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If blood escapes from the wound, cut it off with a saw
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there are more than one stone, then push out the large one first towards the opening of the bladder
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over the stone
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push out the small one afterwards: and do the same if there are more than two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the wound is large, then ignorance is equal to cutting above it with a great section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For a sick man, one of two things must happen: either he will die, or his urine will be retained with excessive frequency: because, in neither case is the whole area solidified
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But one must cause its evacuation, until it escapes: or prepare a fracture of it with scissors, until you have extracted it uselessly
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have finished your operation, then apply a wound cover, aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place over it a soaked bandage of oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water: so that the swelling will subside
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then rest the sick man on his side, and do not tighten the ligaments, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have finished healing it, embroider the place with water, and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents of alum and ointment of basil, until it is healed
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if in the wound there is added a thick swelling, and corruption, and similar things: as when blood is clotted in the bladder and is withheld from it: this is known from the evacuation of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Introduce your finger into the wound, and extract the clotted blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply every kind of remedy that suits the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of the treatment of all these things, to bind up two joints, and to massage, because of the medicines which are placed over the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and lies in the urine-passage, and is fixed in it, and hinders the discharge of urine: then care for it with that which I mentioned before until you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	You are not to evacuate from the section for this treatment, for I have proved it to be useful in many cases.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is necessary to take a hook of iron, which is shaped like a triangle with acute extremities, fixed in wood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread and bind with it the urine-passage under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating hook into the urine-passage with ease, until the hook reaches the stone: and withdraw the hook gradually from the stone: and prepare a perforation in it from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine will immediately cease.</start_of_turn>
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over that which remains of the stone from the outside of the urine-passage.</start_of_turn
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It will break and go out with the urine, and the patient will be healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, you do not prepare this treatment, because of something which hinders it: then bind thread under the stone and thread above the stone.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	And dry over the stone in the urine between the two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.</start_of_turn>
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then dissolve the ligament and bandage the frozen blood which is in the wound.</start_of_turn
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind the thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the bladder: and bind the other thread above, except when you have dissolved the thread after the passage of the stone, so that the skin returns to its place and closes the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to bind the upper thread when you elevate the skin to the top, so that the skin returns to its proper place and closes the wound as we have said.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of the stone from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LX. On the extraction of the stone from women.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, it should happen to any of them that they have a stone, then its cure is difficult, and is forbidden by many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: perhaps the woman is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you will not find a woman who will confess to a physician that she has a stone when she is a virgin, or is still living with her husband
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you will not find a woman who is well-versed in this art, especially the operation with the hand
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance of the stone from the place where it is: because it requires a deep section, and there is fear in that
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to do that, then you must take a female physician who is well-versed: and it is rarely found.</start_of_turn>
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you do wish to take precedence of these, then seek a chaste physician, discreet, and present to her a skilled female obstetrician who is well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has learned a part of the art: make her do everything that she is questioned about concerning the stone.</start_of_turn
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that she may look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for her to insert her finger into her body, and seek the stone.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger, and then command the obstetrician to insert her finger into the lower belly, and inquire about the stone, after she has placed her left hand over the navel, and pressed it firmly.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore the stone is found, it is necessary that it be gradually moved from the opening of the bladder towards the lower parts with the sum of one's strength, until it reaches the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then shut over it above the middle of the bladder towards the root of the hip from whichever side is suitable for it, and feel the stone in that part: and do not move your finger from the stone, keeping it confined under it: and make a small incision at first
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert the radium through that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore you feel the stone, then add to the incision according to the quantity that the stone protrudes from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Of these there are some small and some large, some soft and some hard, some long and some round having a branch.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You know therefore the kind of these, so that you may understand by this what is above it
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood boils, then add in the place of the incision a plaster of gut, and keep it for an hour, until the blood is clotted.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and make ready with me the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may help me in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If therefore blood flows, and you know that the flow of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place and bind it with thread like nails: and do not move it: and let go of the stone, and do not take it out
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the sharpness of the blood has subsided after a few days and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation until the tissue has healed
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Of the cutting of an aquous hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 12
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A swelling is not aquous unless there is an accumulation of moisture in a white bag, which is under the testicles and contains seed: and it is called a hernia
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in the own testicles, which the nature has prepared for it in part or all, until it is burst: that is, there is another seed, and it is the skin of the testicles between the white bag which we have mentioned: and it does not happen except rarely
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of these swellings is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: and it flows out from them towards these matters
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow upon the testicles
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it is of a yellow-orange color, or it is a reddish-brown, or greenish, black, or it is pure white: and this is better
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which you know that there is an accumulation of moisture are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white bag which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round like a seed of the same size: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is in the own testicles, then the swelling is round with a part of the testicles, and because of this the man knows that there is another seed.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the sack, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore one wishes to recognize the colour of humidity, then to experience the colour of humidity in the afterimage with the inner square which precedes it.</start_of_turn>
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which proceeds from the inner square, judge concerning that which is between it.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with the iron, then it is necessary to strip off the principal ailments from the patient, as far as possible, and to let blood from him if it is possible.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it is placed upon his back above the high thing slightly, and put under it many towels.</start_of_turn
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and command the minister to sit on his right side, who extends his hand to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part which is near the navel.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, until almost to the navel: and make an incision following a straight line equidistant from the line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sack which includes it: and scrape it out and observe, or cut it out altogether: and do so with such care as to cause as little damage as possible. And gently scrape away the surrounding area with the scraping, as much as you are able.</start_of_turn
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then perforate the full sack with water by means of a wide opening, and extract all the water.</start_of_turn
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sack upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles which is included: and cut the sack in any way that is possible for you, or entirely, or partly, especially its large size beneath the surface.</start_of_turn
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	If you are not meticulous in your examination, there is no security in the incision, for the water will return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, anything proceeds exteriorly from its cavity in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the gut, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like the rest of the wounds, until it is healed
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find anything corrupted from black bile elsewhere, then it is necessary to ligate the vessels which are the source of the flux of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspension, and extract the contents: afterwards care for it as we have said before
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water has collected in two parts, then you know that there are two veins: dry therefore the other part equally
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if you make them equal, so that the operation be one, then do so: then drain the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the sections the soaked lanen in oil, or in rose oil: and put outside the lanen another which you submerged in wine and oil, and expand it over two testicles, and see the belly: and put over it doubled layers of cloth, and they are sponges: and bind them up above with a ligament which has six fingers according to this shape
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	And draw out two cloths, and wash, and apply the fragrant unguent, according to this likeness: and let the extremities which are sent forth from the hip, or wet wool: and gather them together with the tightening in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity shall take over the top until the shoulder, and the second shall take over at the part of the hip: and the two extremities upon two thighs below, and the two extremities above two buttocks, and gather the whole tightening in the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when it is necessary to treat these matters artificially, with the cautery in the place of incision with the iron: take the cautery in the form of a pointed knife and cut through the skin of the testicles. This is ignited, as we have mentioned previously, until the white fat containing water is detected. Then take the cautery once more, in this fashion.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	When it is necessary to treat these things artificially, with the cautery in place of incision with the iron, take the cautery in the shape of a pointed knife and cut through the skin of the testicles. This is ignited until the white fat containing water is detected. Then take the cautery once more in this way.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it through this fat and it is ignited until all the moisture has escaped.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch out the fat with hooks and remove it with the cautery, which is ignited finely, and cut through it as much as possible, until you have excised all of it
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And burn from outside, so that it does not touch the fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	You know that this operation is safer and more lasting than incision, and better than the operation with cutting
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If indeed there is opposition to the operation in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cautery after the swelling has subsided, or blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary to cure the opposition that exists from that with the treatment that is appropriate for it, as has been said
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is timid and does not expect such an operation because of its horror: then I give the perforation as I have mentioned above: and this is it.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is confirmed to you that this is the case, that the testicle is aqueous: then you must make the patient sit on a raised seat
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the swelling at the lower part of it with a wide spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and keep the opening wide open until all the fluid has drained out
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place over the seat of the patient, and bind it, and let go of it so that it may run off the rest of the water: then care for it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there be resistance to the outflow of water in the hour when you perforate it: and this is not except for the reason that a white plug hinders the exit of the water at the opening of the wound: then you must introduce a bougie in the wound, or an instrument with which the water of the hydrops is extracted, whose form has preceded: or add in the operation of the wound a little of the like.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and gathers after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it has gathered again, then it will return according to the same manner, and pass over the patient's bad days
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Of the care of the flesh of the limb.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section above this limb, there is fear of producing infection in various positions
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore its salt must be taken away from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I recall the operation in it, and the kind of pus
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, therefore, that many abscesses happen in the bodies, from which testicles are made: and this is from many wounds, namely
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or sharp excess, which flows to the testicles
Aut ex percussione.	Or from percussion
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the colour of the pus is according to the colour of the body, and it is not found to be painful: and it is a grave abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose colour is dark brown, and which has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from an aneurism of the arteries, and swelling of the veins: thus is its remembrance recalled in this case: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is from an aneurysm of the arteries, is recognized by the position of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.</start_of_turn>
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it does not behove that you touch it directly.</start_of_turn>
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which arises from the swelling of the veins, does not vanish from this by pressing with the fingers.</start_of_turn
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that in this case an incision should be made, and over the rest of the body: and it is as though one should cut through the skin of the testicles.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	And then extend the hand upwards, and extract it with a white cloth: and remove the clot from the veins, and ligate the veins: and cut through the clot when you have freed it from all parts of the limb.</start_of_turn
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If indeed the limb is consolidated with those natural parts of the body, then it is necessary that you draw out the limb, and cut it through.</start_of_turn
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between some of the bones, or in that which is between the veins: then it is necessary that you free the entire adhesion, and make a circular incision.</start_of_turn
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	And if there is a natural protrusion of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut through all of it, and extract the limb, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When you have completed your operation, then put a bandage soaked in warm oil and wine on the wound, and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it has healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the care of the Ramus, which is with Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Concerning the care of the Ramus, which is with Vite.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	The swelling is a hardened swelling of the quadra that involves the testicles, resembling a bag filled with sand: and it makes difficult the movement and exercise of the patient, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the care of this swelling is fear, because of which there is a recollection of it
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is true that we must say that an operation must be performed in it according to what the first people did
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore that one must make the patient sit on a raised seat
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then drive the suspension of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the nails towards the veins: and let another person hold them, and extend them gently
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp knife in a transverse direction across the vein, until the vessels are found.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove from all around, as we said concerning the arteries in their times
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in place with a loop of thread where there is a double thread, and bind it in the first place where the Vite are: and bind it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the humours that are corrupted.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the care of the other wounds, in which is the generation of health, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle fall away
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not bad for this reason
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, the veins become affected throughout, then it is necessary to extract the testicles with the veins: so that neither the testicles nor the veins are deprived of nourishment through an incision, and that neither of them should become gangrenous or suffer damage from the incision.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Regarding the care of the intestines.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 15
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cause of this disorder is a section [i.e., hernia] which occurs in the large intestine above the belly in the groin from the navel of the intestine.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from this rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	This rupture is either from a hernia or from its extension
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	These two kinds of rupture result from various causes: from a blow, from a jump, from a cry, from elevation of a heavy object, and similar things
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	The sign is when there is an extrusion of the intestines through the hernia.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	This happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen immediately: and it is equal in size to the depth of the hernia: because the hernia compresses the intestine
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	The sign is when there is a section of the hernia, because it makes the pain acute from the beginning: and it is a different swelling, which appears under the skin nearby: and this is because the intestine comes out through the hernia, and its course is towards the exterior of the hernia
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	When the intestines come out with a mass: and this is called intestinal hernia, or strangulation: and when it is accompanied by vomiting
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	When there is stool in the intestine, and it is retained there: and this is with great pain: because it causes severe pain, especially when it is expelled
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these diseases of the body with iron, fear exists: therefore it is necessary that the case be cautiously handled in this matter.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	The mode of action is that the physician should apply pressure to the principal parts of the patient, so as to reduce the intestines to their proper place within the concavity of the body, if he obeys the return of the bowels.</start_of_turn>
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then rest the patient upon his heel between your hands: and elevate his limbs.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch out the skin following the skin to the upper parts, and dry the whole of the scrotum thoroughly.</start_of_turn
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two jaws the section of the gut which is to be opened, according as it is necessary to open the section with the iron: and the section should be made according to the quantity which is possible, so that it may be easily ejected from it.</start_of_turn
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the omentum and that which is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white omentum is detected, hard from all sides: then introduce your finger indicating in that which is following the testicle, which is between the white omentum and the omentum itself, and between the omentum and the substance which adheres to the posterior part of the testicle.</start_of_turn
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand the hand towards the interior of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white omentum upwards, with the left hand: and elevate the testicles with the omentum to the part of the section: and command the minister to extend the testicles upwards: and you will solve the adhesion which is at the back of the complete solution.</start_of_turn
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And inquire with your fingers that there be nothing left inside the white omentum or hard.</start_of_turn
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find anything in it: then drive it downwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take hold of the knot, in which the thick thread is situated: make a loop from ten threads: and insert it through the last opening, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles following the section: then cut off the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads left.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make a figure-of-four knot: and tie with two throws, as we have said, because it is under the skin of the testicles that the ligament should be tied, until it can no longer support any weight, which would cause the testicles to swell excessively
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And pass the ligament again outside the first ligament, a distance less than two fingers wide.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And cut away the remaining whole according to the roundness, and take out the whole thing from there.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry the lower part of the skin of the testicles at the section from which blood runs, and heal: as we have said before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wet wool under the fat and put in a bandage: and manage the ligament which we mentioned before.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white sack which we mentioned has been cauterized after the incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times this has happened to us.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	Cut the ligament until it falls away by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case is delayed, then it will be embroidered with warm water: and put upon that which we mentioned before, until it falls away
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the bandage with the rest of the care of wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	From a swollen root.
Caput LXVI.	From a swollen root.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	From a swollen root, let no one presume to attempt its treatment with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first of all, they say that it is like that which we have mentioned in the Ramus which is concerning the Vite.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Like that which is mentioned concerning the Vite in the Ramus, regarding which, after section, one should facilitate the lower part: then dry in the middle, and afterwards care for that which opens it until the bristles fall out: and care for the wound, as we have said, until it is healed
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the disruption which occurs in the testicles
Caput LXVII.	Concerning the disruption which occurs in the testicles
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the testicles, as we have said, and the place escapes and does not go down to the testicles from the intestines: and if it does go down, it is little and returns in every hour: truly if it is prolonged with that time, a tear is added in the spleen, until the intestines go down into the spleen
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that occurs from the extension of the spleen, which is in the testicles, as we have said
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the spleen extends: then it becomes softened and the place escapes, and the place escapes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with cautery, as it has been mentioned previously.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is being cared for with iron, in this manner: and the patient lies upon his back between your hands
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture after it has escaped and is escaping, by cutting across the breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers wide
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then draw the string until it reaches the white patch [subcute], which follows the black patch [subcute].
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then grasp the loop [radium] and place it over the prominent part [loci eminentis] of the gut, and press it deeply into the belly
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two prominent parts at the extremity of the loop from the gut, and suture them together with one suture: then draw out the extremity of the loop.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the gut at all, neither stretch nor tear anything, like I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have finished cutting the thread, moisten that [the wound] and restore the [tissue], until it is consolidated
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Do not tighten too tightly [the suture], and do not add prominence to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the bowels
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	About the mollification of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because the meats which are between them are softened, and the aspect of it is spoiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is treating him to make him vomit what is above his back, and to cut away the whole softened skin above the natural skin
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then join together two lips with a suture: and if you wish, do so with the superfluous skin of the softened skin by means of three or four sutures, and strengthen the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then insert between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the remaining wounds until they are healed, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Of Castration
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for that reason I am not permitted to speak of it in this book: and it is not necessary to speak of it, except for two cases.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	Of which one is when it is asked about in the science of medicine: and to know its treatment when it happens
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other is that we often need castration for some animals, because of the stench which proceeds from them, such as asses, hinnies, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by cutting off.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision, and cutting through
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the former, however, which is done by cutting off, the operation is as follows: we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften and relax, and hang down: then we cut off the testicles with your hand, until they are dissolved and do not appear to the touch
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and cutting through, it is necessary to hold the animal, and grasp the skin of the testicles with your left hand
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspension, and dry over every wound a single layer of ligature: until when two holes appear: then cut through them after you have excised each one, and do not leave anything outside except for a slight scab, which is over the hair
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And thus is the best method of castration by attrition: for the attrition may perhaps leave something behind from the testicles, which the animal desires for coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	There are two methods for the care of hermaphrodites.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.</start_of_turn
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from the urine according to two methods.</start_of_turn
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that it appears in the space following the testicles, or in the middle of the testicles, like a female vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes the urine runs out from that which is in the middle of the testicles.</start_of_turn
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is one kind, which is a female vulva above the navel like a small penis of a man, protruding outwards: one of them is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.</start_of_turn
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care for the three kinds, of two from the urine and one from the women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of them is gone.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the rest of the wounds.</start_of_turn
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	As for the second kind of hermaphrodites, from which urine comes out, which is in the middle of the testicles, there is no operation, neither is there any care for it.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Of the incision of the Tenticle, and the excision of the flesh that projects outwards in the women's ulcers.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.</start_of_turn
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The limb may perhaps be added above the natural part until it becomes swollen and unsightly: and sometimes it swells in certain women to such an extent that it spreads out like in the womb, and persists until it reaches the navel.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to ligate the supernumerary part of the limb, either with a ligature or with a clamp: and do not delay in making the incision, especially at the root: in order that there be no outflow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the healing of the wound until it is healed
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The flesh which is born from the birth-opening of the womb, until it has filled itself out: and sometimes it emerges outwards like the tail: and because of this some call it tail-disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore to make an incision like that which is made of the limb, and to care for it, until it is healed
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	As for the care of the areola, which is the unpierced hole of the woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The areola is, when it is the unpierced hole of a woman, or when it is a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from the wound which preceded it: and sometimes it is caused by the addition of flesh or by fine fat, or by pus: and it may be either in the womb itself, or in the flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it prevents coitus and conception, and delivery, and perhaps it prevents menstruation also
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is by the appearance of the midwife, if the opening is close to the navel.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then inquire with your fingers or by X-ray.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If, however, the swelling is from a thin ulcer and is close to the bones of the limb: then it must be scraped away, and the ulcer must be broken open.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is necessary to place over two lips two little cushions.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two fingers of both hands together, and the woman should sit with her back against her thighs spread wide.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the thin ulcer is broken open and the swelling is burst.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and the woman should keep it pressed there every day, so that it does not harden in another place.</start_of_turn
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the swelling is large and tough: then it is necessary to cut it out with a knife like the edge of a leaf of myrrh.</start_of_turn
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the swelling is from natural tissue: then suspend the bleeding with hooks, and cut through it: and there should be with you medicines which stop bleeding without causing a bruise, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and such like alum.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a lead balloon wide, so that it does not harden too quickly, keep it for a few days: and administer a decoction of dried poppy seed, then care for the rest, until he is healed.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is birth in the matrix of other tissues: it is necessary to cut accordingly in this way: while there is no cancerous abscess, do not make resistance with iron in any way.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red ones in the veins of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red ones in the veins of women.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed excoriations of the orifices of veins, until such time as there is a great discharge of blood from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When they have been thus diminished, hemorrhoids become small: and as I have said in the enumeration of their kinds, and their signs: here I will speak of what things receive treatment for them, and what things do not
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the matrix orifice, and are not apparent to sense: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those which, however, are in the matrix orifice above which sense falls, are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you put the woman in a cold house
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athehelil with forceps, or with rough linen, and cut away the roots of them
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the veins above the flow of blood from one incision without causing damage: thus as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and the like things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for an hour
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her away in cold water
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding should persist: then make her sit in a decoction of marjoram, and oatmeal, and caraway, and the like things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is thereby separated, it is good: and if not, cause the swollen parts to adhere to each other and to the mammilæ, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and dip in pitch, or in aloe juice, or in vinegar of almonds, that is, aloes, wine of potio, and cause to adhere the parts together
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the swelling subsides, then care for the place with unguents until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	But indeed it is red like blood vessels, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, as I have said before: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the Exitura which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There are many kinds of swellings which occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcer, and tumours, and swellings caused by worms, and herpes, and haemorrhoids, and carbuncles, and abscesses, and gangrene.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I will say also that I will speak of the swelling which occurs in the matrix, when it is caused by the collection of blood, and how it is opened with an iron
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You must consider this carefully
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	When in its beginning the pain of the swelling is acute with percussion, and with inflammation and fever: and you see it turn red: do not dare to perforate it: care for it until the acute symptoms subside
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make her sit upon a seat which beats two seats, and that she recline or be supported upon her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her knees be spread wide, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each ligament conveniently to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and manage the instrument with which the opening of the birth passage is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Which form comes into the house behind these things.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you manage this instrument that the liver be together with the Radio of the deep part of the woman's belly: so that it is not that which enters from the instrument more than the depth of the belly, and causes pain to the lower part.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If however the instrument be thicker than the depth, then you must put sponges upon the covering of the deep part of the belly: so as to prevent the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the belly: and you must put a sponge, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and you must hold the instrument, and must twist the minister of the sponge until the depth of the belly is opened
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the Exitura appears, and the hand grasps it, and it is gentle and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it off at the head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the urine is evacuated, then it is necessary that you put into the wound a cloth soaked in saffron oil: or in olive oil, in which there is some stickiness: and put on the cloth, and withdraw the section from the depth of the belly
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put externally upon the belly, and upon the navel a wet cloth of wool covered in water, in which there are bad bulges.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be cared for for two days with an unguent which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	When the matrix and the vulnus have been washed, it should be cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled. Then return to the unguent.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the vulnus is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to prohibit its care with iron, and take care of it in the way we mentioned in the instruction
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Concerning the treatment of the embryos of women, how to medicate them, according to an unnatural figure of egress.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to know at first the figure of natural delivery
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	When women are pressed downwards by their waters and they desire to smell the air, and they feel a sensation above what is below concerning the birth, and they hasten the exit of the embryo: then you know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and that the head comes out first, and the second with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress the belly, so that the embryo descends more quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon the head, the second descends with it, and they go out from these superabundances with a good expulsion
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is outside of this part is unnatural and dangerous.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out upon its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot alone: or its head and hands, or its belly: or perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things from the unnatural figures
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent, cautious in all these matters, and to fear both error and neglect: for I shall disclose every figure and how skillful it is in this, and it is signified by this, and it stands above all else.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out upon its head during natural delivery, and its head is thrust upon the woman, and delivery becomes difficult for her, and its force is diminished: then let her sit down, or let the women hold her up: and let steam rise up from the vinegar with bay leaves and with oily substances.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician inserts his small finger between the toes of the patient, and finds the second one, and cuts it with his nail, until it runs its course in it from the moisture: and he presses upon the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer an enema to the woman with vinegar of bay leaves, with oilseed.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to sit after the enema, and let her strain: and hold her hand and her nose for an hour together.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey in the delivery, then place the woman down and lift up her feet: then push down the seat upon the earth: and the woman shall be held, so that she does not fall from the shock
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, however, the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut open the belly, and extract the fetus: and tie up its hand with a cloth, and extract it with evenness: for it will come out itself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The fetus has emerged above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	As the fetus emerges above its feet, it should be pushed upwards: then gradually restrain the fetus: afterwards it will be level with it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then grasp one foot and gradually extend it
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the thighs, then command it to lie down, so that it is compressed, and cause it to strain: it will go out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural shape
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out on its own when its time comes.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is obstructed as we have described: then grasp from the upper mud of the belly, and with sponges and salt: and pierce all through with a good blow: then join with the blood of the woman and the lower part of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make it sit in warm water until the afterbirth follows
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When the lower parts are softened by the heat, then make a scar of myrrh: and put it to rest
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When an hour has passed since the incision, then make it sit on a seat
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make it strain: and bind its jaw and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with ease
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus has emerged above the knees and hands
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this form, then gradually draw in its hands
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman lies upon her hip, and her feet hang down towards her ankles: she lies upon the bed and puts her hands to work.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then she gradually puts her hand above her belly
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then she pulls out what is under her feet from the shoes until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then grasp her feet and move them with the utmost care
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then gradually put your hand above the navel until the fetus ascends to the upper parts
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hands and gradually steady the fetus: and command the woman to bear down, until the fetus comes out
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus comes out hanging sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Attention should be given to the reduction of her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If, however, it is not possible to reduce them, then lift the woman up and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she is still unable to walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike her thighs with great care
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the unguents which you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she bears down, then make her sit on a stool
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reduction of the hands, and steady the fetus according to its natural shape: and command the woman to bear down, and tell her to compress herself, until the fetus comes out
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus comes out on her hip, with her hands spread out, and her face is turned towards the mother's back
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The obstetrix must hold the hand of the fetus firmly, then gradually release it and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place above the navel what we mentioned from wax and mucus
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command it to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make it sit on its seat, and command it to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command it to close: and make it breathe with the nose closed
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus is ready to be born on the right side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it has descended through the birth opening in this way with the second finger, then split the second with your nail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut the cord from the navel: so that it is not retained and does not die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then urge the fetus inwards, until you place it according to what is required: and command the woman to compress herself a little: for it will itself go out through the easy birth opening.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The birth of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born together: and sometimes three or four are born together.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is an unusual thing, and is rarely found.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five things indeed are outside of nature, and do not live together: and they contain those, even though they multiply, together: and they are separated by the navel cord of each one of them
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through a natural birth opening, easily: and they come out through an unnatural birth opening, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If any of them are difficult in their parts, and arrive at that which we mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: let the leech be slight, and let it do what it does with ease and tardiness, and adapt itself to every figure as it is prepared for it from the guiding spirit of safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that which is formed in the matrix from embryos, and aborts.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more are formed in the matrix: and I have seen that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them being formed
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	As is done by the measure of the glorious sage
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this is necessary in the science of Midwifery
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps also it will reach like that: oppose to it what is necessary for it
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with the thing which I mentioned in the discourse of medicine, and it does not go out, and you must do it by operation with a hand, then you must consider
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If a woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the things from which she is afraid that she will lose the child: then it must be that the woman rest over the bed, over her back, and let her head be inclined downwards, and her legs be elevated: and the minister should hold the abdomen from two parts, or bind it to the bed, so that the body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os matrix with oily things with high mucilage, and chaff of aloes, and linseed seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the Obstetrix apply his hand with these oils and mucilages: then he shall insert it into the matrix with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he shall seek the place where the ribs rest from the fetus, and the convenient place for it
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider now, if the fetus is prepared to descend over his head: then fix the ribs in his eyes, or in his neck, or in his mouth, or in his palate, or under his beard, or under his collarbone, or in nearby places of the ribs, and under the hypochondria
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is over his feet, then in the loin and the middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary to hold the hand with the right hand: and put the curvature of his hand in that which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and insert it with the hand with ease, and fix the hand in some one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the ultimate goal.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix the other hand, or the third, if necessary: so that there is an equal contraction, and it does not incline to one side
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then extend with an equal extension, and it is not to be extended only according to the rule of the straight line, but rather move to all parts, so as to relieve the emergence of it: as it is done with a tooth at the extraction of it.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary at that which is between these, to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if it is retained from this part, then let the Obstetrix grasp any finger with oil, and insert it from the side, so that it may recoil with what is retained
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore the limb of the fetus comes out, then exchange the nails to another place which is higher: do this until the fetus comes out whole
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If, therefore, the hand goes forth before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it is necessary that it be suspended above the palm.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	If, therefore, the hand goes forth before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it is necessary that it be suspended above the palm
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or if there is constriction in its egress, or if there is water accumulated in its head: then it is necessary that it be introduced between the fingers of Spatumile spinosum, and that it be held together with it, and that the water be extracted: or that it be ruptured with an instrument which is called Almisdac, whose form is like that of the other instruments in this chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise do as if the fetus has a large head: then it is necessary that the membrane be separated: or that it be extracted with the hook, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	When the head comes out, and is grasped at the collar: then it is found, until the humidity which is in the chest is drained out
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If, however, it does not become complicated, and is not obedient to its egress: then cut the head off as best you can, according as is possible to you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower belly is apostematized, or if there is hydropsis in it: then it is necessary that it be pierced, until the humidity comes out from it
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If, however, the fetus is above its feet: then its traction is easy, and its direction to the maternal bones is gentle
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If, however, it is constricted at the belly, or the chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with the cloth which you have enveloped over your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until the pain is gone.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, the remaining limbs are raised up and the head returns: then the Obstetrix inserts his left hand inside.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the matrix opening is wide open, then he inserts his hand deep into the matrix and grasps the head, and pulls it with the fingers until it reaches the matrix bone: then he inserts one or two fingers into it and pulls with those.</start_of_turn>
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If, however, the matrix bone is closed, because of a thick clot which has formed on it: then it is not necessary to toil above it, but rather it is necessary to administer an effusion of humors, fats: and administer plasters: and sit in water which softens and moistens.</start_of_turn>
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is over wide, then it is possible to equalize it: then the following is administered to the fetus as before.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do this, then it is cut off and drawn out.</start_of_turn
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not let anything escape from the second part entirely.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said in the clots which arise in the matrix.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flow has occurred, then descend into the styptic waters, and administer the remaining treatment.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman in whose womb a fetus had died: then another fetus was impregnated over it afterwards, and afterwards the other fetus also died.</start_of_turn>
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	This happened to her after a long time that a clot formed in her navel, and it became inflated, until it opened: and pus began to flow from it.</start_of_turn
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I have been called to his care and have treated him for a long time: and the wound has not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I place above it some strong adhesive plaster: and it has come out of its place.</start_of_turn>
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed, and the bone came out again.</start_of_turn>
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I am anxious about it, for there is no bone in the wound.</start_of_turn>
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I think that there were dead bones in the fetus.</start_of_turn
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I questioned the wound, and I extracted many bones, the woman being in better conditions: and I left it thus for a long time, and there came out a little pus from the place.</start_of_turn
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not fix this foreign body, except that in it is knowledge, and an assistant for that which the artful doctor administers with his hand in treatment.</start_of_turn
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of the necessary instruments for the extraction of the fetus.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.</start_of_turn>
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which books are equalised, to which are equal two strings at the extremities of two sticks.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	Truly this Vertigo should be finer than the Strictor: and that it may be made either of ivory or of seasoned wood.</start_of_turn
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the breadth of every stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like one finger, and the length of each of them is palm and a half: and in the middle of the two sticks are two projections of the same kind of stick, which are fixed in both, of whose length is half a palm and a little, and the breadth of each of them is like two fingers, or less.</start_of_turn
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two adjuncts are introduced into the bone of the matrix, so that it will open when you revolve two Vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Two such Vertigines are formed which open up the matrix when they are revolved
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	The other form is like that described before, but it is subtler and smoother
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It is made from a splinter of ebony, or from ivory, according to the resemblance of pincers
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	There are two adjuncts at its extremity, as mentioned above: and the length of each adjunct is like a palm, and the breadth of each is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open up the matrix with this, then make the woman sit on a lectum, with her feet hanging down, and open that which is between her buttocks
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two adjuncts together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, like making pincers, equally according to the quantity of the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the Obstetrix wishes to stop
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The other form of the Vertigines is like that described by the ancients: the form of the Impeller which drives out the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the Almisdac, which counteracts the large head: and it is assimilated like pincers which have teeth at the extremity, like these above
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is bent, like pincers in this form, like these above, which have teeth like sharp teeth, with which it incides and counteracts
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of the Almisdac which counteracts the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The neighbour's house has one spin.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The neighbour's house has two spins.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of the forceps with serrated teeth, with which the head of the fetus is countered
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of the spatula has two extremities to cut off the head
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two spatulas also of the handles
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more numerous the kinds of them are, and the more they are prepared by the artificer, the faster is the operation and the greater is the benefit to the patients, because of their quantity
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not despise the appearance of the instrument, because it is prepared for you
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	The necessity of these things is obvious
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	About the extraction of the second one
Caput LXXVIII.	Head number 78
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second one is retained at the birth, then it is necessary to grasp the lower part, so that it retains its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it grasp with the thumb and index finger: and grasp the hand over his bone, and the breath of the same.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out through this, it is good
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then grasp all of them, and pierce in the uterus through the navel: and put in it fragrant herbs, like calamus, rue, marjoram, chamomile, hyssop, and saffron: grasp all of these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a bundle of reeds over the navel-cord of the vessel, and the other extremity in the bone of the uterus: and hold it until the steam comes out to the cavity of the uterus
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make the incision as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	It will come out easily by itself.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command the Physician to immerse his hand in warm lard, or in high slime.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then introduce the instrument into the wound, and search with it the Second [anatomical structure].
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When you have found it, then grasp it and gradually expand it
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is an appendix that is deeply embedded in the belly: then introduce the hand again as we have said, until you have found the Second [anatomical structure], and then gradually pull it out following a straight line, so that the belly does not tear at the point of traction: indeed it should be turned with ease to the right and left sides: and then add some traction to it
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It will obey you then, and will be evacuated, and will depart from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the belly-wall is hard, as we have said: care for the wound with incision, and give it medicinal herbs from the jar.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have said: then be careful not to tire yourself out in the process of extracting it.</start_of_turn>
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Truly it must come out to the belly-wall from the Second [anatomical structure] to the groin of the woman.</start_of_turn>
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then close the wound with four-leaved bandages.</start_of_turn
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	This will putrefy the wound after a few days, and will dissolve, and will depart.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Truly when it has putrefied, it will emit a foul odor from the stomach and head, and will cause pain which will make the patient weak.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that suitable fumigations be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients are experts in fumigation with naphtha and drying figs
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The manner in which a woman is fumigated for retention of the second and monthly courses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be like a bath from behind, or from the heel: and put on the outside over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the loins: keep it there until that fumigation has been consumed: and do it again for another one
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an unpierced animal.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their heads whole, and the animals of them whom I have seen, I have oiled with soft fat
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore that the midwife pierce that fat with her finger: and if not, pierce it with a pointed spatula: and beware of tears, lest it touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on it fat-soaked wool in wine and oil
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with nails until it heals
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however it is oiled, then put in the ear a leaden cannula for many days, and take it out when the boy wants to spit.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And sometimes the oiling of an animal also takes place from the consolidation of a wound, or from the swelling.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that that consolidation be dried up, and then care for it as we have said before concerning the treatment and lead
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas which happen in the lower parts are Nodatio and Grossitudo, which happen close to a deforis: or in the space of one part. And there is one fistula, or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When the Nodatio has become old, it opens and moisture like white water, or subtle pus, flows from it
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore they are recognized by what comes out with the evacuation, and by the swelling, when the patient evacuates: and perhaps it comes out with worms
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas when they are penetrating from the space until the rectum, and until the meat of the abscess.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating until the joint of the hip, and until the node of the buttocks.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this it is known that a penetrating fistula until the deforis, even if not penetrating, is like that which you introduce your finger to the deforis: and you introduce something subtle into the fistula from the air, or from the iron, when there is no twisting
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	When there is twisting in this, then introduce into the abscess something like lead or a hair from a horse's tail, until you feel the abscess, or until the hair comes out in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel the abscess itself, neither does anything come out with the evacuation, neither swelling, neither worms as I said: then you know that it is not penetrating: go therefore for treatment
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating until the rectum, or until the meat of the bladder: then the meaning of it is the evacuation of the urine from it, and the prohibition of this from happening again so that the place may be solidified with the doctors.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If the wound extends up to the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that the tentacles reach up to it, if not twisted up to the bone. And there is pain around the part, and discharge of pus from it always. And it does not yield to treatment, neither is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	In all these penetrating wounds there is no complete cure: the cure for them is toil and perseverance from the stupid doctors who cause them.</start_of_turn>
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those which are not penetrating or old, healing is hoped for with rest: as I have said before, and as I have proved: let the sick man lie between your hands on his back; elevate his legs up to above his hips, and let his thighs rest against his belly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air into the wound, if there is a twisting of the wound, until you know where the tentacles reach.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the sick man feels around the part a sensation of heat, then it is necessary to insert your finger as an index into the part.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel the tentacles of the wound grasping your finger itself, as well as between your finger and the flesh, or the bone: then you know certainly that it is penetrating. Do not toil in it, for its cure is not to be found in this way, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that in some men the wound heals by itself, and by the application of medicines which are expected to cause it to swell: thus one must apply gentle cautery according to the size of the wound, and introduce the flame into the wound, until it reaches around the part.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh has become soft like the feathers of a bird.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for it with butter-soaked dressings until they emerge from the flesh, which has become soft: then care for it with unguents generating flesh and solidifying it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it heals well, that is good.</start_of_turn>
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, it will not heal with any other treatment.</start_of_turn>
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out, and does not stop until it reaches your thumb, which is in the year, and is between the thumb and the great toe, and there is a thick piece of flesh or fat there: then make a fistula there following the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you dry with the thumb which is in the fistula until the drying reaches the end of the thumb, and the thumb is freed and falls off.</start_of_turn>
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then soften those soft tissues which have become like the feathers of a bird, so that nothing remains of them.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood boils between you and the operation, and dissolves between you and the operation so that you must cut away those tissues: then it is better to cauterize with fire or with acute medicine.</start_of_turn
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization with fire brings together good habits, addition of the added flesh, and cutting away blood, and drying out moisture.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with butter-soaked dressings or poultices until the place emits pus, and the soft tissues emerge in pus.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for it with strong unguents containing solidifiers, generating flesh firmly: these are medicines which have styptic properties and drying qualities.</start_of_turn
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When restoration has taken place, then healing follows: and not by repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	When, however, a fistula persists even to the depth of the rectum, and is prolonged by the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the rectum and inquire concerning this.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If, therefore, you feel resistance, and between you and the other there is something like swelling of fat or flesh, and it is close to the penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the degree of trust and hope
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For indeed, one must administer in this case three modes: either that you cauterize the same (as we have said); or that you dissect it, until you have accomplished the subsidence of its swelling, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures and effect a cure from the next time.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the dissection, lest you cut through the membrane containing the rectum, and thereby bring about a more grievous discharge of evacuation without your will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for this as we have said
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps indeed healing will take place: or you will stretch out that swelling and cleanse it after you have dried it up near the rectum, as we have said, or with your finger, or with some other acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse the surrounding flesh which is in the dissection, until where fat adheres to the scraping.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt to restore the entire wound with the dissection, and the upper orifice where consolidation has taken place: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the rectum, and will be less painful
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when the fistula has been sutured in this manner: that is, when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is at the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the rectum: then grasp the perforation at the extremity, which is like a nail, that is, like a harpoon prepared for skin, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	Enter into the belly the swollen thread from five threads, and circle it around.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then enter the needle with the thread through the fistula, until the cavity is filled.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is penetrating in the inner margin of the anus near the base, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so that you may insert your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and bind both of them, and send it away one or two days: and the more the thread has entered the flesh, bind it well, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread have fallen away: then care for the wound until it has healed, and is cured.</start_of_turn>
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare it, except if it is too deep.</start_of_turn>
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	You must not make it penetrate by force, so as not to damage it.</start_of_turn
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do as we have said, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Form a sponge of spicery which is found in the fistula, whose curvature is acute above and blunt below, so that the other part is not acute, so as not to damage that which is not necessary, like urine.</start_of_turn
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	About the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood runs from the incision of them: and the care of the incisions.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.</start_of_turn>
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids of two kinds.</start_of_turn
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are within the anus, like the seeds of charcoal, or of plums: or they are like little grains of wheat.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	There are both small and large wounds: and blood always flows from wounds, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	There are both internal and external wounds, and in their extremities
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	Truly, those which are external to the belly are for the most part small wounds of moisture, from which flows clear urine or a little blood with slow flow: and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of the wound which is inside the belly is that you must apply pressure to the wound: and squeeze out the blood, until the anus comes out, and the wound is seen to be clean again.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, hold the wound shut with fingers: or keep it closed with your thumb.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut around the roots of the wound
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they do not remain in the wound because of the moisture of the wound and its softening: then cover the wound with rough cloth, or with a piece of felt wool, and pull out the wound with your fingers
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut through, and powder over the wound after cutting whatever powders are warm, so that they remain in the place of the burn
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or burn the wound according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the wound with the remaining treatment, until it heals
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	When the anus does not come out, then apply a poultice to the patient in the place where there is a little pain, so that it will be eased as soon as the patient has discharged himself, when he presses it
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	When the wound is outside the anus, then the matter is light, easy: and it is as if you were to grasp the wound with your thumb, or grasp it with a finger, and cut the wound
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	Whoever shuns incision with the sword, must now manage to administer suture in this fashion.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a looped thread, and pass it through the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the splinter to the higher parts, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the opposite side: and loop two extremities of the thread, under the point of the needle in the lower part, and make them lateral: and tighten the splinter securely.</start_of_turn>
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and draw out the needle.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the splinters, and let go of them from one: neither their own blood nor that of others must contaminate them.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over them a wet compress of infused linen in rosewater, or alum, and put it over them: and command the patient to rest.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the splinters have fallen out, care for them with unguents, and leave the rest of the treatment until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	(End of excerpt)</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Many times these occur from the excessive evacuation of the bowels, and the constriction of the natural parts.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When these are thus diminished, and do not yield to medical treatment: then it is necessary to rub with the point of the sponge, or with your finger, until they become soft, and the outer layer which hinders the adhesion is removed.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for the wound until it is consolidated according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they are not consolidated: then repeat the procedure with greater reason than before, until much blood has flowed out, and then they are cleansed with care, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the treatment of wounds and non-wounds: and of blisters and ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.</start_of_turn>
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that Almirmar is not except a round node according to the colour of the body, like a key-head: and it exists throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the digits: and it arises from inflammation caused by pain in walking.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that you drain what is around the key-head, and hold it with forceps or with a hook, and extirpate it from its root.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was said in its chapter.</start_of_turn
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	As for blisters, one is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation above the surface of the body.</start_of_turn
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often happen in the hands of young boys.</start_of_turn
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment for it is to extend the blister and cut it open: or to tie it up with a silken thread: or with hair, until it falls off.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus the inward blisters are eradicated, and not the outward ones with the instrument which I shall tell you of.</start_of_turn
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	As for ants, these are also small, filtered elevations, large, above the surface of the body, which are biting downwards in depth: and when they bite, it feels like a bite of an ant in them, and it happens throughout the body: and most of them happen in the hands.</start_of_turn
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a needle from the belly of a frog, or a strong needle of wool: and you place that needle above the wound, until the circle of the needle contains the parts of the wound.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then you withdraw your hand with the needle until it severs what is around the wound: and you place it in the depth of the flesh, and you extract the wound from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with an air needle, or a needle of iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the needle reach the tip of the thumb that is grasped, so that it may be stretched and easily withdrawn.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the wound according to what is stated in the chapter on cautery of Athelius
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	About the forms of the instruments which are used for Clisteria in ailments of the veins of animals, and about the solution of the belly and the collicum
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When a Clistere is made from silver, or from gold, or from blown glass, or hammered out.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made from these instruments, great and small, according to those in which they are used
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Thus what is administered in the treatment of young children with soft lungs, be it small: and of those animals which are weak or suffering, thus also Clistera of them
Clistere magnum.	A large Clistere
Cistere paruum.	A small Clistere
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The needle of it, that is, the upper part of it on which the uterus is tied, is wide according to this fashion: and there must be a distinction so that the uterus is tied like water, and the lower part which goes into the belly is deaf, that is, not open, soft, yielding, stretching to thinness: and on one of its sides there are two holes, and on the other side one hole
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The width of the opening should be according to the length of the rays, and more widely the less, and there should be a space in which the medical instruments are placed from the belly of the beast: or from parchment of a bird, which is according to the form of a small ass: of whose root is a single palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	The hole is pierced through with many holes as it turns, and there is space between every hole as wide as the breadth of a finger
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into the holes a strong thread from raw thread, which is from ten threads, or thereabouts, and gather it up with it like an ass's hoof
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is thus placed in the belly, it is sutured at the head of the intestines between two distinguishing constrictions of strength.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	And then close with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the form of the circle of these here parts, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the closing with it is: that you should measure the belly or the belly from the medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold, nor too warm nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is laid down on his back, and lifts his legs up towards the shoulders: and put under it a cushion, that is, skin over which people lie, or linen
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then bind the extremities of the intestines with wax, or with white chalk, or with barley mucilage, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the belly with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then take hold of the belly with both hands and press it out until it ejects everything that is in the intestines of the Clister
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the Clistere, and elevate the patient's limbs towards the side.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the physician considers him fit for discharge, then retain him as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps through the whole night, that is the greatest benefit of all
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you put him in the bath of the solution of the belly, and he shows signs of recovery: then repeat the Clistere until he is cured
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are piles in the year, or painful fistula, then let the Clistere be soft and gentle, from the Clisteres which are given to children
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the gentle Clistere which is over that which is strict of the skin
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the cure of wounds of the head without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head wound number 84
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have said in the discussion of the treatment of wounds that it agrees with the book, and I will tell you here the treatment of them with the hand and with the physicians according to their custom
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are varied according to the thing from which they arise, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	So also those wounds which arise from many causes are like the wound of a stone: or the cutting of a sword or knife: or the percussion with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and like these from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	And the wounds which arise from the place of the body are like the wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the thigh: and like these from many parts of the body.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am saying concerning the treatment of wounds, that I shall set out the reasoning and rule concerning the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	I shall begin with simple head wounds: for the memory of compound wounds will arise at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple head wound occurs, and there is no fracture of bone: consider then, if it is from a piece of stone, or like that: and if the skin only is fractured: it is a great wound, and the time of healing is greater than that of a burn: then proceed cautiously, and perform a cephalic bleed immediately: do not delay this: and extract from him from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue: if there be nothing to prevent it by any other thing, especially if there be little blood issuing from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bleed be from the opposite side of the wound
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the infirm person be guarded from repletion, and wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prohibits reduction, then they will be made to abstain from food, and not approach meat or drink.</start_of_turn>
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if it happens to him a soft dressing of fat or lint soaked in rose oil, or with wine in which there is a clotting agent.</start_of_turn>
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are secure from the soft dressing, then place over the wound, if it is still red with blood, and has not changed its colour, the plaster which I will tell you of later: and if it has changed its colour, then place over it some unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is great, or is from a wound with a knife, and similar: and the edges do not adhere by stitches, then join them together with a suture, according to what I shall say concerning the sutures of the inside wounds.</start_of_turn
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, a limb is detected as hanging loose from its bone and is not to be retained, except in a very small suspension: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Care for the limb with the physicians, and restore in it solid flesh in place of the skin, and command the patient to feed on nourishing foods such as heads and cooked wheat until the pulse: and such things are similar.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the flesh putrefaction and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the whole putrefied part and cast it away: then care for the rest
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in his limb there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by the physicians, then inquire concerning the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not severed, then cut it off with sponges or ligate it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels you when it does not conform to what we have said, then burn it, until it is severed
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: so that they may be powdered over this powder: because they consolidate these before they change them by air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The manner of the powdered meat.</start_of_turn>
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe: take part one of olive oil, part two of dragon's blood, and part three of unburned lime: mix them all together thoroughly, and sprinkle them: and apply it to the limb, and bind it securely, until it adheres well to it and clots with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then string it up with sponges, and let it go, and do not keep it until it is dissolved, because it may putrefy it
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	No wound is banished by medicine until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	When alone it does not suffice for a wound, when neither ointment nor dragon's blood is present, even these great operations are of little benefit in many large wounds, for when they are united and bound over, the recent wounds with their own blood do as much.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	When it has been altered by air, especially in hot weather, the object of this dusting is not in this case: care for it as before, that is to say, put upon it some digestible unguents: or make pultes of barley flour, made with water and honey, until pus comes forth.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed there is a fracture of a bone which is small, extract it with forceps: and I shall speak of the cure of head fractures in this which the future is.</start_of_turn>

Caput LXXXV.	Head wound.</start_of_turn
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed a wound occurs in the head, then there is no difference between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.</start_of_turn
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however the neck has been cut through, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, it is not in its place, except that you must take care of its cure with something which brings about hemostasis, such as sponge, and saffron, and is like these things.</start_of_turn
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they are ignorant of nerves, and they drive them away.</start_of_turn
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	Do not put anything cold upon the wound whatsoever: for the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the soul of the limbs: and it should be treated with gentle medicine, such as powdered gypsum with sweet water infused with some oil, or with rose oil, and turpentine, when it is also washed away with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, in this manner, and moist unguents.</start_of_turn
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then administer a suture: or bind up its lips with wool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the wound is deep, or if it has occurred in a sinus in its lower part, in which pus is gathering, then perforate it in a depressed area in that place.</start_of_turn>
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, it has been cut through in the wound, and blood flows from it: then separate, or dry up the blood, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if need be.</start_of_turn>
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, it has penetrated the cartilage of the jaw, or the whole thing, and the teeth are loose: then gather together the lips of the skin with a suture over the jawbone, and do not touch the jaw, rather equalize it, and reduce it over its natural shape.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it tightly with a bandage, and release it in a few days.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents in which there is a property of stypticity and drying, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the wound has made an imprint in the bone, then query it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract them all, or what can be extracted from it: and what cannot be prepared, leave it, until the wound has healed, and the fracture has been separated and consolidated.</start_of_turn
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound has been burnt, then powder over it the powder which I have mentioned.</start_of_turn
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula has occurred: then care for it with that which is mentioned in its chapter.</start_of_turn
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Of an ulcer in Spatulis.
Caput LXXXVI.	Of an ulcer in Spatulis.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is percussion of the lance or the knife, and the blood of it runs deep, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If there comes from the ulcer swelling, when he sighs from that one, then you know that the ulcer is mortal
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep, and it is accompanied with blood, then do not put in it at the first hour powder, nor string it up, lest you retain the blood in its depth, and it die. But put in it a strong unguentum and solve it in two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed there is no unguentum there, then put in the mouth of the ulcer a thick wool, so that it may absorb that which comes out of it from humilities: and make the patient sleep over the ulcer, so that it may heal what is aggregated in it
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have passed since the ulcer and the patient has not had a spasm or a bad tremor of the heart, nor any stricture in swallowing, and the rest of its conditions are good, then you know that the ulcer is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Cure it diligently and with care, and with treatments, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed it is excused that its healing has escaped, and it always opens, then you know that a fistula has been made
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Cure it from its head to its tail
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the ulcer is from the incision of a lance or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then cure it as if it were sutured, if it is great: or with powder if it is small
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, he has made an impression in the bone, and it comes loose from this: then inquire about the bone, and properly extract the fragment, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then leave them alone, until the bone becomes putrefied, until then relief is found in extracting them.

¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and the extraction of them.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption which happens in the belly is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great, indeed when the intestine or the number of intestines come out
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Because of that there is an introversion of them, and their suture is more difficult and painful
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small disruption is also difficult in another way
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not take proper care of the introversion of it to its place immediately: because it swells, opens, and thickens: because of that it is difficult to enter it
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, the middle disruption is better: because with that there is not a difficult reduction of the intestine, as it is in the two former species
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the belly is done in four ways
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common with regard to the suture of the belly, and with regard to the suture of the rest of the body: and two other sutures communicate properly with the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	True are the things which are proper to the bowels with suture of the belly: and I tell you one thing and another with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	When a wound is small, and something escapes from the intestine through it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then that is by one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said: or because of an inflation in the intestine caused by the cold of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When it is thus, it is necessary to warm it, so as to soak the sponge or the cloth with warm water alone
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil in water squinance, ginger, pepper, and embrocate with it the intestine, until the inflation is resolved
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it has made this liquid which has styptic power: it is better than water alone for resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When the inflation has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with the water in which it was boiled, or the decoction itself.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For thereby it alleviates the entrance of it with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, it evacuates after this cure, then find in the wound a small opening, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cauterized.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first cure is better when it is prepared, than the section: and it does not cause a bursting because of the defect of the instrument after necessity.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part be acute and the other not acute, and the outer part not be with the smoothness of Spatumilis, but rather be somewhat obtuse: and that is what resembles a cheese, like urine.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound is increased and the intestine enters, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible above it: because that is better.</start_of_turn>
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie upon his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly: then put his head low and his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And in the same way if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly: then put your intention and consideration always in this, that the part which has the wound should be higher than the other part
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary that you do this with great wounds and with medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But with small wounds, put this in the way that is prepared for you
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that there is a holy hand present between your hands which maintains the whole rupture with his hand: and join his lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then withdraw from it him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common way of stitching one thing to another.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is necessary that you take an awl or the number of awls according to the quantity of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the extremity of the rupture the quantity of an index finger, that is, the physician: and fix the awl one beyond what you introduce into the skin in two extremities, when two extremities of fat which is under the skin from the inside have been made to penetrate from another side, and when you have gathered together the two extremities of the skin and the two extremities of fat: and there are four orders formed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	And then string with a double thread around the circumference of the awl several times from two parts simultaneously, until two lips of the wound are aggregated with a decent gathering.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the breadth of the finger also, and fix in its place an acute angle: afterwards draw back the thread with the needle, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to make this until you have completed the ligation of the whole wound
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let there be medium needles between the breadth and the thickness: because the fine needles easily slip through flesh: and the coarse are difficult to pass through the skin: therefore it is necessary that there be medium ones in the thickness, and the breadth.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not fitting that the needle should be fixed at the two nearest ends of the skin: so that the flesh does not slip quickly, and that the wound does not open before its consolidation, and does not lengthen even with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the extremity of the needle, so that it does not wound the patient in his sleep: and put on cushions of wool from all around, which hold the extremities of the needle: and let go of them, until you know that the wound has consolidated
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this is how the suture is done with needles like these is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For a suture of these needles suffices one, or two, or several of them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second suture is common, that it joins together four extremities: two of the skin, and two of fat in one wound, with a needle in which the thread is even in thickness and breadth.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the needle through the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that the thread which is drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the suture of cloth which is done by drawing together cloth, and put between every suture as much of the thickness of the little finger as possible.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	Men know this stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	When such a stitch has been made, men know that it has become like a wound which has occurred in the belly and which has been inflicted by a knife, and that there has been a rupture of the gut greater than a palm of the hand: and it has gone out from the intestines for about two palms from the middle intestine, and there has been a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	And so it was reduced after it had been set outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	And it was consolidated in the space where it had been for about fifteen days: and it was cared for, and it healed: and it never happened again after that, as the man continued his life in his usual way.</start_of_turn>
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	The doctors declared that it would not heal.</start_of_turn>
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it happened by a miracle that it healed without ointment.</start_of_turn
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where ointment was not to be found, and no doctor was there.</start_of_turn
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I put upon the wound a wool cushion twice a day, and I bathed it with warm water until it healed.</start_of_turn
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	And there are two kinds of stitches which are proper according to the narration of the sermon.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is like this: you begin with a sharp stitch: and you pass the needle from the outside inwards through the part.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has thus pierced the skin, and has gone through the whole thickness of the body: you draw out the end of the thread in the side in which you introduced the needle, and you make it penetrate outwards at the opposite end.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have finished making the opening incision, then make another incision beside it on the same side, from the outside to the inside: and withdraw the tissue which is on this side, which is on this latitude, and make an incision in the opposite extremity from the inside to the outside: and make an incision with your incision which you make in the tissue of the extremity which is beside this, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	And also begin from this side, and withdraw the tissue which is in the siph of this side, which is on the other latitude, and extract the point from the skin where it has penetrated.</start_of_turn>
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	And reduce the skin to this side, and withdraw the tissue which is in the siph of this side with this extremity: and extract the point from the skin which is on this side, and make this one whole, and the other: and make this one whole after the other, until you have extracted the whole from this side according to this example.</start_of_turn>
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of all these sutures is like the sutures of the skin which join the skin: so that you join the siph from one side of the extremity of the skin: and that you withdraw the other from the other side, until you have completed it.</start_of_turn>
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture, as Gale has said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the way it is said of these sutures, as some physicians do, that they are made like certain things, so that they bring together all the parts to a corresponding extent by nature: and apply the extremity of the siph to the other extremity, and the extremity of the bone to the other extremity.</start_of_turn
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done as I have said.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you place the point in the extremity of the bone close to you from the outside, and make the incision towards the inside in this place only: and withdraw the two siph extremities.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then draw out the point and cause it to penetrate from the outer side inwards through two extremities of the sponge, namely both of them.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then draw out both [points] and cause both to penetrate from the inside outwards through two extremities of the sponge, which are on the opposite side
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this is the better way of stitching, and it is the stitching of which the memory remains.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is as Galen himself has said.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said that
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture is corrected inwards with two cubes.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, put into each of the two cubes a single thread: and begin with the introduction of the needle from that which is towards you, and cause it to penetrate until it reaches the other side, following the suture which is between the skin.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the inside: then the suture of that is more difficult than the rest of the inside locations
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the true healing of a wound is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, when you follow up the wound with its blood, before it changes itself: and reduce the belly, and take hold of itself, and fix it: then put over it the powder of burnt barley
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	For if the air has already changed the wound: then put over it some unguents which are in your presence, until they make pus: and the threads fall out, and consolidate the sponge, and dry it
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this as for the care of the rest of the wounds, until it is healed
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If, however, there are no medicines present, then place above it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, a swelling: and change it twice a day until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For indeed you do not need other medicines in many situations when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, it threatens to communicate with the principal parts of the body in the lesion, then it is necessary to immerse fine wool in lukewarm oil or in rose oil: and place it around the area which is between the groin and the armpits
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens in this case) then instill it with wine vinegar, black and warm: especially if putrefaction has already occurred in the intestine, and an opening has been made through it
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	Know that what is great from the intestine is easier to heal: and what is small from it is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called the jejunum does not recover from a wound that occurs in it in any way: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their number, and because of the fineness of its body, and because of its proximity to its own nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is cartilage, and you follow it up, reduce it according to your reduction of the intestines which you equalise.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed it has passed beyond that space, and has become dark, or black: then it is necessary to tie it up with a thread above the place which has been denigrated by it, so that the flow of blood does not occur
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in cartilage there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so as to counteract the traction of that, and the extraction of it concerning the case of the wound, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound that happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption happens in the intestine, and it is slight: then it is possible that it will recover in some people: because I have seen that which was wounded in the belly with the lance and was on the right side of the stomach, and it was ancient: and there was made a fistula, and it went out from there egestion, and swelling
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I put therefore the cure in place, until I am not hindered in the healing of it: neither will I stop cautiously until it is healed, and the place is consolidated
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	When I have seen that the place is consolidated, I fear over the sick man, that something bad may happen to him in his belly: and nothing of that happened to him from that bad thing.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And it remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, hopeful, and went into the bath, and exercised in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters say, when a wound happens in the intestine, and it is slight: then it must be bound up in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like taking large ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and put an ant on one of those which have an open bone over two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When you have put that over them, and you have bound its bone, cut off its head, and it will adhere to it, and will not dissolve
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing that until the second ant has reached the amount of the wound throughout.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the wound and its swelling.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	They remain fixed heads attached to the intestines until the intestines are fed, and are healed, and do not cause great discomfort to the patient
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	It is also possible to ligate the intestine even with a fine thread: which has been removed from the intestine of an animal, is attached to that which has been brought into the knot
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And take hold of the extremity of that thread from the intestine, and draw out a great deal.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then ligate at its extremity that thread which has been wound around the linen thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the knot, and attach it to the intestine with it
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to disruption
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with ants and intestines, is not except according to the measure of trust and hope
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, a wound that is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the large intestines: then there is no skill except subtiliation, and its healing is not at all
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of care for ulcers and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know, every wound, or swelling when it grows old and decays, and forms a ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and does not heal: then it is called universally in every part of the body a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.</start_of_turn>
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is indeed a second, verified nodation of a filtered and hardened white substance: concerning which there is no pain, which has the character of the feather of a bird: and on account of this they call it Risati, which is a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And sometimes it is moist in certain hours, emitting pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And sometimes the moisture breaks in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes the moisture is much, and is little: and is great, and is soft
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I say beforehand in my discourse that any wound which does not heal, neither is born in that flesh, is not except for one of these nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of the malice of its nature: or because it is between itself and the lips of the flesh is hard flesh, which hinders the birth of flesh: or because there is much pus and pus-like matter: or because the wound itself is putrid, and the matter which issues from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inappropriate for the treatment of it: or because corruption which falls in the region is a kind of pestilence: or because of the property of the region, as it happens in Caesarea: in which there is great difficulty in digesting food and the healing of wounds is delayed by nature: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I will teach you all these causes and signs and the treatments with the physicians in my discourse: and it is fitting for you here to write the treatment of the fistula and the zuka, which is done by one operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You know therefore that a fistula can happen in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from these things are fistulas which extend to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the bladder: or to the intestine, or the stomach, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebrae, or to some of the compound joints: such as the hand, and the foot: and those which arise from these things which are close to the principal limb, and to similar things
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	That which proceeds from his fistules is, according to this method, from difficult diseases which do not receive treatment, and is accompanied by toil and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If from any fistula whatever its depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned: and thou dost hope and trust in its treatment, and dost desire to reach its knowledge, then take hold of an attempt from air or iron, since the fistula extends according to its straightness, and inquire concerning it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is a twisting in the fistula, then investigate concerning it with a subtle weight.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead with its softness alleviates the body of it, and it curves about the twisting
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for thee to signify over them with a single attempt
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Gather therefore from each orifice from its orifices.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture which thou gatherest from each orifice goes upon the other orifices, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire concerning it in what way is possible: that thou mayest know what is there, whether it be bone or nerve, and that the fistula is of great or little extent: or that the fistula is one which has many orifices, and lies over all that, with the sum of thy strength: with thy interrogation of the sick person, and the finding of pain upon compression with thy hand over the place, and similar signs and symptoms following.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When thou hast stood upon every one of these stations truly, then come to the treatment according to thy confidence: and it is that thou considerest then, if the fistula which appears is near or far from the juncture, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have mentioned to thee: then dry the fistula according to what is said above in the narration, and remove from it that which is in it from filtration, and from corrupt foods, which is born in its orifice from flesh, or pus, and the like: and care for it until it be healed
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the fistula is of great length and depth, and is according to the rule of rectitude: then it is necessary that it be cut away as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then it is necessary to remove the whole of its corrupted flesh from it
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply sponges wetted with sharp medicines: and introduce these until you have reached the depth of the fistula which you comprehended with the iron: do this little by little, until the sharp medicine has eaten away everything that remains in the depth of the fistula from corruption
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore the part with unguents which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal by this, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect that: then inquire about it, and cut it away according to what I have narrated: if it does not prevent you anything from the bone, or nerve, or main limb, as we have said
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore it is found that there is bone in it, and that there is some corruption and blackness: then burn it away, until the corruption of it is entirely removed
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	Which if it does not heal, and emits pus like it was doing: then you know that you have not reached the whole eradication of the corruption
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore investigate further concerning it, and make a reason for it, and treat it with the utmost skill you possess.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If however it heals, it is good: and if not, then you know that that corruption is in a great depth of the body, which you have not been able to reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	No force is there in that limb, except that which is driven out by the nature itself.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the bone of the limb is corrupted, and it is possible that the limb may be drawn out, draw it out with fine forceps that fit to that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then take great care in drawing them out, and do not let anything remain in the limb with your force
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed something causes resistance in the limb from humors, and there is no fear of incision, or an error: then incise those humors and tissues, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed the limb is not prepared for the extraction of the bone at that hour, then place upon it that which will cause it to decay: and draw it out when it has decayed from the surrounding bones of flesh and humors.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the limb so that it does not become consolidated.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision be as small as you made it in your operation
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	And if you put on it, if necessary, a bandage soaked in sulfur with oil: or a bandage soaked in Egyptian unguent or any other unguents of your choice.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when they have decayed indeed these humors, and are separated from the bones, the wound will be soothed, and the attraction of them will be removed
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If indeed there is a large bone, such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, and those like these, which are corrupted from it, is a great part: then take away that part in its last degree, until the black spot and the corruption are removed
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed that which is in it corrupted is a great part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut through it and open it up to the depth where the corruption exists: then take care of it until it is consolidated
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you this, that which has happened to me in my leg: that you may take it as an example and aid in your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A youth of about thirty years of age had pain in his leg, because something had moved within his body towards the thigh, and as a result there was swelling: there was no external cause of the pain
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It has been prolonged thus with the error of the physicians until the swelling opened, and many materials came out together with it
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after that his cure was delayed until his leg was bandaged, and many holes were made in it: from which pus and moisture of the body were emitted
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	And they treated him for two years with various physicians, but there was no skill in their art, until I saw him and opened his leg, and the matters which were coming out of his holes in great quantity: even all the men in the place fainted, and his color was pale yellow
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Then they attempted to open one of his holes, and they reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	And I saw that all his holes were communicating with each other throughout the whole thigh
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I treated him accordingly, and I cauterized one of his holes until I saw a piece of bone: and I found it corrupted: for it was rotten, discoloured, putrefying, and perforated, until it had penetrated even to the marrow
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I saw what had been detected by me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I thought that there was no other corruption in the bone except that which I had cut away, so I cauterized and excised it.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	I will eradicate it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I shall institute the restoration of the wound together with the physicians in a spacious place for a long period.
Et non est consolidatum.	It is not consolidated yet
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and I found upon the second examination: there is a continued corruption with the bone: and I saw that there was also corruption from that corruption itself.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	I then attempted to restore it
Et non est restauratum.	It is not restored yet
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I found therefore upon it again, and I did not cease to cut the bone piecemeal, and to try to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut from the bone about the space of one palm, and I extracted that with the marrow together
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and no further operation was necessary for this purpose, except for the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because he was perishing in every hour from excessive vomiting of bad evacuations
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was healed completely: and was born in the place of the broken bone, and was made well the disposition of his body, and recovered his strength: and was discharged from his bed: and did not cause him any pain in walking ever afterwards
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to bind it up as follows: take a ligament and bind the fractured bone at its extremity: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament of greater thickness than the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh which is above the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the meat downwards: and you will know that the meat is properly placed where you wish to cut it, so that it does not damage the meat
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the center: for when you do this, it will not prevent the marrow from separating the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	The incision should be made above the corrupted part without damaging the surrounding area of the bone.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, the corrupted part must be continued with the sound portion: and the corruption is in the middle or the part itself: then remove the flesh from all sides entirely
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, saw from the first part where the corruption is until the incision is continued from the other side: and let the incision be as far from the corruption as possible, as we have said before.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, saw through the corrupted joint and saw the bone where the incision continues from the other side
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no wisdom in it except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the palm of the hand or in the sole of the foot: then matters are difficult there
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is necessary to inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape away the bone and clean it as much as possible according to any way that is possible for you: and with whatever ingenuity you can manage, so that it does not cause harm to the vein or nerve
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	You know that the saws and chisels for cutting this bone are many, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their size, their shape, their weight, their fineness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherever necessary, one must prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	You also know that these operations are greater than the kind of instrument which is suitable for them, when you have long studies about them
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony of the modes of illness: for then you will find that everything which is suitable for one infirmity is not suitable for another
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	I am firm in the last of this chapter concerning the number of instruments, which I have placed as examples of those which you should take into consideration, and the trial which you will experience with others.
Forma Serrae.	Serra form.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of the other Serra
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of the third Serra
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of the fourth Serra
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of Serra is made, when it is placed in the center
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Its arch is made of iron, its point from steel: and its handle from boxwood, and it is made pyramidally in the center
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of Rasassa of the united.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Its head is like the head of the clavus stellatus: and its points are like the points of the elishate.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	It is not suitable, except when it is rubbed with it, because of the fracture of the head, or because of the great swelling and size of the bone
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the greater Rasassa
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the middle Rasassa
Forma Rasorii lati.	Form of the narrow Rasassa

Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of the other incision is curved at its extremities
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of the other incision is small and fine
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of the other incision is like that of a broken bone
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape of the other incision is great
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like a radio and the extremities are like a saw: it appears in many places because of the reason for the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of the other incision is suitable for the reason for which it has been made through the bones
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremities are triangular, and the extremities are acute
Fit ex Indi.	It is like an Indian
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it should be like this for all incisions, and for the sutures and the saws
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	As for the incision of the extremities, and the suture of the bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either by an external cause, or an internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you have treated the cause of this corruption with medical means, and the cure has not occurred: and if you do not cut away the corruption of the limb which does not recover: then you must cut away that limb until the corruption has ceased, so that the patient may be saved from death or from the greater defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this is that the limb is blackened, until it is burned: or it becomes putrid after blackness: until that putridity is cut away from the limb itself, and from the whole body
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Properly therefore when the incision has been made, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from a blow which has struck some of the veins: such as a scorpion of the sea, and vipers, and spiders, and things of that kind.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption is at the extremity of the finger, then incise the finger and not leave space for the corruption, but proceed until the other hand is reached
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the palm, then incise from the root of the bone, and not leave space for the corruption, until it reaches the wrist bone
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it comes to this, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption has passed, and you see it surrounding the elbow: then in that is the cause of the malady.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer besides this from the treatment, is the quantity of the vomit.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do the same with the foot, when the corruption comes to the finger, then incise it at one of the joints: and if it happens at the heel, then incise the whole foot
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it reaches the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if the corruption has gone beyond the knee? Then it is not in that it is incurable, except for amputation, and to leave the patient dead.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to incisions the limb, or to save it, is as follows: to string the ligament in the lower part, which one you wish to cut: and to string the ligament above in the place of the other
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend one minister ligament downwards: and extend the other minister ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments, with the edge of a spatula, until the whole flesh is torn away
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it may occur, or it may return.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	Then it must be placed from all parts of the bandage around the limb, and must not touch the healthy area: and it must be added to the patient's pain, and the swelling must be cooled.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, blood flows inwards during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or place above it some powder that will absorb the blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicine, until it is complete.</start_of_turn>
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage that is suitable for it, and care for it, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I say that this happened to me in my foot, this is what happened to me.</start_of_turn
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because in my foot there was a black spot, with a swelling which assimilated the heat of fire: and the corruption first happened in my finger, until it reached the whole foot.</start_of_turn
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore I removed the person from himself, after I had cut away the corruption from the limb with my shears, because of the pain, and the swelling: and I put it on the joint, and it healed.</start_of_turn
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in the nail of his middle finger.</start_of_turn
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to cure the swelling with the things which I put on his hand from the physicians after the purification of his body: and the swelling did not disappear, but it increased in another finger: until the corruption reached the hand.</start_of_turn
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to cut off his hand: and I did not do that, hoping for the return of the swelling: and I was also afraid of the death of his hand.</start_of_turn
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Wherever there was a wound on a man, it was above the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	When I had left him, he returned to his land: and he came to me because he had been nearby, and he wounded his whole hand: and he was healed.</start_of_turn>
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not relate this story except in order to help with regard to that which falls from the nature of this ailment: and in order to show what is signified, and according to how it is done.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the care of bones, and the quality of blistering with the physicians.</start_of_turn
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When there is swelling in some limb with carbuncle, and the swelling is prolonged until collection of pus has taken place: then it is broken open, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is driven out, and the cavity which remains is like a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a thin membrane which has been stripped off: and it does not reach its final corruption, neither does it reach the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a sinus, and not a fistula, truly; but if the space of the former is prolonged until corruption affects some part of the limb, then it is called a fistula, or swelling.</start_of_turn>
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care of it is that you cut away the whole skin as it turns black: and especially when it is thinned out, and made like a membrane: and trust that it will not stick to the place, because of its corruption.</start_of_turn
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and that no corruption will result from this: and if there is thick blood in the skin, then treat it with blistering: and consider it as a sinus.</start_of_turn
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it be great, and the pus which proceeds from it is foetid of odor: then clisterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and gum, equal parts, gathered in a vessel: and boil them over fire, until the medicine turns red: and then add honey to it.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize it with wine: and tie up its orifice, and give the medicine in it to the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw out its contents with pressure: do this every day, until the sinus is healed, and the stench is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is clistered with vinegar and water, when it is not present this medicine: then take charcoal of wood or charcoal of beech: and cast it on the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then keep the water still, and clisterize with it, until you are confident that the sinus is healed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, neither vinegar and water: then clisterize it with water and honey, to which something of ground mastic has been added
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clisterize it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to heal and cleanse: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of styptic and drying in it.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this often, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has departed: then clisterize it with something that makes meat grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take from alum of diaphanicon: and dissolve it with rose oil and wine styptic: or clisterize it with some medicine, and anoint with others, of whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the sinus is strict, so that a cannula will not pass through it: then widen it with a needle; or place within it a pledget of lint in Egyptian unguent, or in basilicon unguent, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	Similarly, if the opening is also large, then gather its lips together with sutures; and let out from it as much as enters the bladder without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if pus comes from the opening, let it be raised upwards: then dry it in the lower part which is in it, so that it comes out from there downwards: for pus, when it is collected in the depth of the sinus, hinders the generation of flesh in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible to dry the sinus round about downwards, then try to prepare the limb with the preparation which lets out pus with ease according to the way it is prepared for you
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try that no pus remains in it at all: and take solidifying medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend ease over the edge of the wound.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the size of the dressing be such as to communicate with the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then pierce with forceps directly at the opening of the sinus, widening the opening of the sinus with a needle.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the sponges above the other dressing, according to the quantity of the hole: and place it over itself in a long position away from the opening of the sinus, so as to relieve the discharge of pus from it: and do not put on a large dressing, except after a few days or until one has healed one
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is over the opening of the sinus should move in every hour, so that what is gathered in it from the pus may go out: and you will know whether it is much or little, or digested or undigested
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And thus again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether the master of the limb feels pain there, or whether there is no pain there, and whether there is swelling there, or whether there is no swelling there.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When you have thus advanced your remedy in this way, and you have dried the material which proceeds from the opening of the sinus, then you will know whether the sinus is firmly adhered, or approaches adherence: then you must remove it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you have removed the ulcer, then change the bandage, and renew the unguentum.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If, however, it proceeds from the sinus beyond a long space or a subtle ulcer, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, because there are men who are slow in the generation of flesh in their ulcers, and there are those who act contrariwise to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, it proceeds from the sinus after many days with undigested pus, then you know that the sinus is not adhered
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If thus the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add in the treatment of the physician, truly let the physicians do what they will, that there be moisture in their medications and dryness in their moisture: like gypsum, when added in excess produces abundance of moisture.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last method of treatment, that is, take gypsum and dissolve it with rosewater, and apply it over the old liquid in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then keep it together with this, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does the same thing to this action as when there is no gypsum present, honey, when you boil it, until it has thickened, and you use it with this
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloes, and olibanum: mix them all together, and grind them over honey while it is still over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then line above the belly, and string the belly above the hip: and line with honey which you boiled, until it is thickened: and powder above the belly, and put above the belly the belly-bag, and string it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered in this belly-bag, long parsley, and roots of lily of the valley, and is lily: and barley of herbs, and centaury
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use either singly or compounded, these, and the sponges themselves: and powder above the honey which I have told you of, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, the matter of the sinus prolongs and does not heal with this treatment: then you know that in its depth there is a corruption: or that it makes an imprint in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat the fistula according to what has been said before
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the treatment of panaritium and nail-drawn, and the addition of incision of the finger, and section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XC
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is a swelling which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps arises in the rest of the fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it prolongs, and is neglected in its treatment, and becomes inflamed, the swelling becomes hot: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrupts the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole, and perhaps the corruption extends to the bone, until there is an offensive odor: and it makes the extremity of the finger wide, and makes its color dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you are treating it, with that which we said in the explanation, and the treatment does not confer cure: then it is necessary that you cut away with the knife the whole superfluity which remains from the nail
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the ulcer afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	The cautery is indeed useful for the ulcer above all.</start_of_turn>
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail also is sound, and the addition of the nails overlaps the flesh inwards, and it begins to bite itself, and damages itself: then it is necessary to place a radium beneath the nail at the angle which bites the flesh, and push upwards: and cut away the flesh easily, and place over that which remains of the flesh from the burning and corrosive medicines until it is completely removed.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however corruption has already occurred in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away the bone and extract it: for it will never heal while it remains corrupted in that bone.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	And if you see the corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger, then cut it off at one joint, as is appropriate in its remembrance.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however there occurs to the nail attrition or percussion: and it is accompanied by severe pain, then it is necessary to perform phlebotomy in the first instance.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with Spatumili cut in a transverse section from above downwards to the end.</start_of_turn>
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful, lest the cutting should reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will thereby cause additional pain and swelling.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which rests the pain.</start_of_turn
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	A finger that is born with some man's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; perhaps there are some bones in some of them; perhaps there is a nail in it. Some of them are born in the root of the joint, or their origin is in some node of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	He who is born in some node of the finger, is not moved: and he who is born near the joint of the finger, perhaps is moved.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	He who is born of flesh, his section is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	As when you cut through his root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	His origin in the root of the joint is difficult to cure.</start_of_turn>
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from cutting it.</start_of_turn>
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that case, where he is born at the end of the nodes of the finger, then it is necessary to cut through his flesh in a circular incision until you reach the bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then grasp the bone with one of your knives which fits into this.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Consolidation, however, which happens to fingers by means of pressure, happens frequently either from the nature of man himself, that is, because it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from the burning of fire, and the like.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary to remove this consolidation until the finger returns to its natural shape.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then put between the bones some splints, or soaked rags in fat: so that they do not consolidate too quickly, and separate the bones: or put between the bones a thin sheet of lead, until the place is consolidated as it should be.</start_of_turn
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation occurs between some digits and the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to what is prepared and comes close to the figure of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	And concerning the incision of veins.
Caput XCII.	Chapter XCII
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are veins which are involved, large and full of melancholic humors that happen in many parts of the body: and most of the time their occurrences are in the legs, especially in the legs of those who are on the move and working, and in the porters.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is therefore necessary to administer an excision from the black bile somewhat forcefully alongside the evacuation.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then let a bloodletting be made from the patient easily with a basilisk.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these is in two ways with iron.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One is to cut them off, and extract the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	The other is to elevate the vein, and extract all of it
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of them is in this way
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Embolize the limb in the first place with warm water, until the thick blood has dissolved
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the limb of the patient from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a thread.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then lift it up, that is to say, extract the blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from the top let the phlebotomies be made of the patient in the first place
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the limb until the quantity of blood which you have evacuated is equal to that which remains in the limb, and as much as the patient can tolerate of the pain
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	After the ligature is done: and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, for that is harmful to the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of the part is to be done in this manner
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	The elevation of the limb is to be done when there are many hairs in it
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then insert the instrument into the bath: or bind it to his limb with warm water, until it turns red, and swell the veins: or perform a strong exercise, if there is no bath for him, until the limb is warmed up
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin along the line of the vein section: or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with needles, and scrape the vein from all sides, until it appears to the sense: and it is at the appearance of this that the blood in it changes from red to black turning pale.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When the blood has gone out through the hole, the blood in it is like a cord of white thread.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert under it radium, until it is raised up and comes out of the skin: keep the blood suspended with a pledget of cotton wool
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry the other part nearby three digits.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears to the sense
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift up the blood with the radium as you did before, and keep the blood suspended with another pledget like before
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry the other part, or several parts if necessary
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate and bind the last part near the heel
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract the thread above the navel.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	Then do this until you have extracted the thread from the section which is above the rest.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, it does not yield to being extracted, and hangs: then introduce a needle with a strong thread and ligate the thread, and extract it: or introduce it under that [Radium] and draw it out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Take heed, lest you cut [the vein].
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you cut it, it becomes difficult to elevate the thread and it enters through that document into the belly
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have finally extracted the thread: then place upon the wound a soaked linen cloth dipped in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twist which involves parts, and is not as we have said in accordance with the rule: then you must find upon the thread throughout the whole extent of the twist, and the place of the twist itself.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend the thread with hooks, until you have extracted the thread whole: and take heed at your section above the thread that you do not cut the vein, or wound it: for it is difficult to elevate or extract it from there.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Be prudent in this matter.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	This is how the wound is closed when the vein is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The closing of the wound is like that of a blind man
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curved like the other wounds, neither is it acute at the ends, as to cut the vein: and it has a large flexibility, gentle: for if it were slight, it would split the vein by its smoothness: or if it were too great, like this.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
Caput XCIII.	On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the thighs in warm regions, like Alizegi and Arabia, and in dry, warm regions, where little vegetation grows.</start_of_turn>
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	It is also found in other parts of the body besides the thighs.</start_of_turn
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Its formation is due to the decay of matter under the skin, like the bites of serpents and worms, and the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	The sign of the commencement of the extraction of this vein is inflammation in the thigh with swelling.</start_of_turn
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area is to be desiccated.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein is extracted from the desiccated area, as if from the root of a plant or an animal.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When it appears from the extremity of the vein, then it is necessary to cover it with lead, whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas and a node, and let the lead hang loose from the thigh.</start_of_turn
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Every time something comes out of the vein towards the exterior, cover it with lead and a node.</start_of_turn
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it prolongs for a long time, then cut off a part of it and cover the remainder.</start_of_turn
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	Do not cut through the root before all of it has come out.</start_of_turn
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut, it contracts and enters the flesh: and it causes an abscess, putrefaction in the place, and a bad wound.</start_of_turn
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Wherever it is necessary, it is necessary to extract [the stone] gradually, until it comes out completely from its last place without leaving anything behind in the body: and from this vein [the stone] comes out in some people at a distance of five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And indeed it has come to my attention that it has gone out of the body for twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, this should happen to you during the course of your treatment: then insert radium into the cavity of its [the stone], and perforate the cavity with a needle as long as the body, until it is evacuated completely from that material: and administer the decomposition of the place with physicians for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the aftercare of the wound.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many outlets, and comes out from every outlet branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Care for it in this way, as we said before, and as is required in this matter
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Of the cutting above the worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bovine Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in this land Bovine Disease: because it frequently happens to cows, and is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	It runs throughout the body, ascending and descending: and is shown by its sensation during its walk from limb to limb, until it breaks through the skin at the place where it breaks and comes out
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the corruption of some humours
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and serpents do, thus also lumbrici and ascarides within.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	They are like worms and serpents in their malice
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	When they enter the body and rise to the head, and reach their place, they often burst open there and come out, and destroy the eye: and thus it happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to cure them and extract them, it is not done except by their walking and their sensation
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore that you bind that which is above and that which is below with strong ligature
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over them, and extract them.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has gone deep into the flesh, and you do not find it: then put a cautery with fire over the place until it dies
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than this is the corruption of its matter, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see that it is approaching the head near the eye, then bind under it with strong eyebrow-lashes.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over them, and extract them
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the patient should abstain from food and drink, with physicians resolving the harmful humors of the body.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Of the section above the navel Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which happens in some member, and then changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	I too am affected by this, as I have mentioned to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I have been called to a woman who is ill in some place
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	She has discovered her arm and sees swelling in the armpit of her arm
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	An hour later, she sees another swelling forming like a worm, going up to his shoulder more quickly than is possible: like silver that is running from one place to another
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore departed from that place, and it was fixed in the shoulder
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then, after an hour, it ran through the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was returning all over her body, as I had seen
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I marvel at the speed of its change from limb to limb
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I too have never seen such an illness before in this way
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	I have indeed seen many people who suffer from pain that changes from limb to limb: but I have never seen anything like this before in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not believe this is possible, except that it is due to the moisture of the armpits: from which it appears that the pain is changing its location
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that this does not appear in delicate people and in bodies that are moist with sweat, where the armpits are hidden
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you see this happening, and the patient still feels pain: then if you see it in the eye, as we have said, grasp above and under quickly: and dry above, until the moisture is expelled: cauterize the place.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not aid the eye itself with your hands: then care for it with the expulsion of bodily humors, and with that which ejects wind-poisons, and carminates it with foul pills and serapine pills, and the like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Of the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.</start_of_turn>
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are varied according to their kinds, and according to the places from which they fall from the body.</start_of_turn>
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	There are indeed various kinds of arrows: for some have large cusps, others have small ones: some are concave, others are convex.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those which have three angles.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And there are those which have tongues.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And there are those which have stars.</start_of_turn
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	The latter are according to the parts in which they fall, is according to two modes.</start_of_turn
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or, the parts are from prominent parts which are concave, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and things of that sort.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When, therefore, it falls into any of these parts, and you see signs of death, which I will narrate to you afterwards, then it is necessary for you to extract the arrow from the part, for death follows its wound in various positions.</start_of_turn
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see these bad signs, and the arrow is not hidden deeply in the part, then extract it and care for the wound.</start_of_turn
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	Signs, therefore, of the brain when it is pierced by an arrow, and the bone is penetrated, and the substance above the brain is ejected, are: vomiting of saliva, spitting, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood escapes from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps the blood is shed, and the vessel is ruptured.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And from the wound's moistness white pus like putty escapes.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it blood-like moisture escapes like meat broth
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs appear, then abstain from treatment and extract the instrument if it does not escape naturally.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the fracture when it lies in the chest are: that it is close to the left breast: and that it feels like it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the fracture is of a movement like the pulse: and blood flows from the wound black
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following this are coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You know therefore that death approaches without doubt
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	The sign of the fracture when it wounds the lung is the escape of bloody foam from the wound: and the after-effects which follow the head, are swelling and change in the color of the patient.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And a great, high breath expires: and it craves cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the fracture lies in the breast, which is in the chest: then it is close to the loin: and there is a great sigh with pain and with gasping, with a tremor: and all the limbs of the arms are moving
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	If the fracture lies in the stomach, then perhaps blood escapes from the wound from some undigested food
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	If it lies in the abdomen, and is fixed in it: something like stool or bile or intestine which is broken escapes from the wound
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope in treating it, neither in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow has fallen into the bladder, and urine is being excreted: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is more severe: then you know that it is mortal
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, neck, gut, tongue, auxiliary, ribs, spine, shoulder, hip, thigh, and leg, and similar parts of the body, are to be examined in accordance with various arrangements: when the arrow has not been found in an artery or nerve: and not that the arrow is venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	I tell you that I have seen many such arrows, which signify to you the futility of your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because I have seen the arrow go down into the pupil of his eye, into the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I extracted it from the other side, under the earlobe: and he was healed, and no wound remained in his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had gone into his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not find its tip except where it was stuck in its wood: and the arrow was a great one, like the arrows of the Turkish archers, with lead in it, in which there are no ears
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He was healed of this, and no evil happened in his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the gut of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and these are the ones that have ears
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Following this, between two ribs: and it was submerged in his gut
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I am prudent therefore with her, until I have extracted it: and the Christian is healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	Until I have extracted it, I am cautious with her: for it has perished within him.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed, and no change appeared in his condition concerning the wound, I extracted it: and he was healed, without any subsequent misfortune.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	I saw a man to whom an arrow had been shot in his back, and his wound was consolidated over his belly
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years, the arrow was extracted from the root of his thigh
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	I saw a woman to whom an arrow had been shot in her abdomen, and her wound was consolidated over her belly, and the arrow remained within her: and no change appeared in her condition from her natural operations
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	I saw another man to whom an arrow had been shot on his face: and his wound was consolidated, and the arrow remained, causing him little pain, just like many others
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	I extracted an arrow from the King’s nose, which had perished in the middle of his nose, and which had bent to the right side: and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to treat him after the arrow wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the arrow wound closed tightly
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I questioned him carefully with subtle words, and he did not feel any pain: and even he himself recognized the puncture and the pain from his right side
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that it was nothing more than the puncture from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I placed the plaster upon the place where there was a virulent attraction, and digestion, trusting in me that the place would abate, and that a sign of an arrow would appear, as it did above: and it did not happen in the place where the arrow had followed.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I applied the plaster for many days in that place: and no accident happened, and the swelling subsided meanwhile: and he remained unable to extract it from that space until he felt an arrow one day enter his nose
Et narrauit mihi illud.	He told me about that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I placed upon that place a sharp and corrosive medicine for several days, until it opened: and when I tried to grasp it, I found a slight arrow which was adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound that sharp medicine again, until we saw the arrow clearly: and it passed out of itself within that space for about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the swelling had subsided, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into the wound, and to move it, it did not obey its exit: then I did not cease to dilate it, and to apply above it various means, until one day, when I applied it with pointed forceps, according as it had been customary at the end of a chapter, I was able to extract it from the wound
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	The physicians say that the cartilage of the nose does not recover
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore, and the swelling subsided, and he recovered his health completely: and nothing was left of it
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you what was the case with the extraction of several arrows: so that you may know the rule and the signification of that which I have not mentioned
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions cannot be comprehended with mere narration: neither does this book comprehend them, nor does the skilled artisan compare them with few in comparison to many. He considers what is present alongside what is absent, and thereby discovers a new operation and a new instrument when external things of this art occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not depart from the members to which they are attached, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place from which they entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or in the opposite direction of the other part
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And whatever proceeds from where it entered, that is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: it is attracted and proceeds outwards
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not issue forth at the time when it fell: then it is necessary to remove it a few days later, because the flesh surrounding it has become corrupted: and it will be relieved of its attraction and its emission
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	In the same way, if it is fixed in bone and does not issue forth from it: then it must also be removed a few days later: and repeat with its attraction and movement every day, until it issues forth.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not issue forth from it after days: then it is necessary to perforate around the arrow in the very bone from all sides with a fine saw, until the arrow is loosened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	And then draw out the arrow and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If, however, the arrow is fixed in the head of a bone, and has passed through one of the brain cavities, and appears from the diseased side of some of those accidents which I mentioned: then abstain from the attraction of the arrow, and remove it, until it is equal to itself after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	If an arrow is retained within the bladder, then the urine does not prolong its course.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	If the arrow is not firmly fixed, except in bone, and does not penetrate as far as the bladder: it remains painful for some days, and nothing happens to it from these accidents. Then the origin of the arrow and its extraction must be sought out.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is firmly fixed, and does not yield to traction: then apply a compress around the arrow as I have told you before: then wait in place until it is healed
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If the arrow is hidden in the body and is not visible or palpable: then seek it out with your senses.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it out with some instruments that are suitable for the traction of the arrow.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you are unable to grasp it because of the constriction of the wound or because of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, no nerve, or blood vessel there: then find above the wound until the wound is widened and the arrow can be easily extracted.</start_of_turn>
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	When these are held by the ears, then loosen the flesh firmly fixed in the bone from every side, by every means which you can think of, and draw out the arrow, if it is possible, without fracturing the ears or twisting them until they are relieved.</start_of_turn
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	When you are administering the extraction of the arrow from any place, then use the twist of your hand with forceps to all parts, until you make the arrow depart: and do the last thing cautiously, so that the arrow is not fractured and that its traction and extraction are easy.</start_of_turn
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you are unable to extract it within an hour, then leave it for a few days, until the surrounding matter putrefies.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then do it again: if an alien cause has produced a flux of blood, do what we said in the chapter concerning treatment. And guard your virtue from the incision of a vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	Do it diligently in every way that you can for the evacuation of the arrow: and let this be with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and firmly, as I have told you
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	It is necessary that you should handle the arrow as you would a living thing, so that the patient remains according to the figure, as it was with the arrow itself in the case of the arrow in this matter.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For thus is the work of a craftsman.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible for you to do this, then do what you can from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which comes out from the opposite side, or which proceeds from that to the outside: or it makes a swelling at the extremity of the arrow towards the side which is close to the skin, and it goes out: dry it therefore above the wound, and let the incision be according to the quantity which they hold in their forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull out the arrow: it is itself easily expelled.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness, until you press the arrow into the bone, and expand it for itself: then pull it out
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then do it again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow-shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If indeed the shaft has broken, and you wish to administer a push: then introduce into the wound an instrument which is concave, so that its concavity may be introduced into the heel of the arrow: then push out the arrow with it
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrow is concave, then push it forward with the instrument entering into itself.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	If, however, the arrow is concave, then push it forward with the instrument entering into itself.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If, however, the arrow is toxic, then it is necessary to remove the entire flesh in which the poison is located: if this is possible.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for the wound as is appropriate for this case.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow has fallen into the chest, or the belly, or the side: and it is close to where you touch with your hand, and it is possible to dry over the wound: then dry, and burn at the incision of the vein, or nerve, and remove the arrow.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then bandage the wound, if necessary, and care for it until it has healed
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are removed
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	There are two similar extremities like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not loosen the wound
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of forceps, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow, and the thinness or thickness of the wound, and the tightness of the wound
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the pushing instrument for the concave arrow
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	The form of the pushing instrument for the blunt arrow
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the shape of the handle like a radius, so that its entrance into the concave arrow is alleviated, and it is pushed with it
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The handle of this pushing instrument is concave like the beak of a bird: so as to alleviate the entrance of the arrow into itself and the pushing of it
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On the Phlebotomy of Veins.
Caput XCVII.	On the Phlebotomy of Veins.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins which are to be phlebotomized, of which there are thirty in the body, are numerous.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	From these, there are six in the head: two pulse- veins which are behind the ears, which are called Herbae; two arteries which appear in two temporal regions; two veins which are in the two tear-ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi, which are in the neck
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins which are in the lower lip
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are the veins which are called Algecherich
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	As for the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms, there are five veins in each arm
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalica, which is from the side of the armpit: and it names the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	And the Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And it is the Middle vein, and is composed of the branches of the Basilica and the Cephalica: and it names the vein of the body
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilica, which is situated in the domestic side: and is also called Titillicaris.

Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	Indeed: for round about their circumference are small veins, black.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	They must therefore be cut through with the knife which is going to be used for the incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If, however, you are in doubt and do not know which is which: then you must resort to the greater incision of both of them, and their demonstration.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	After the cephalic phlebotomy, draw out the vein under the tongue
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	For indeed the veins which are under the tongue are phlebotomized along with the cephalic vein: that is to say that the cephalic phlebotomy is for the affections which are in the gullet, and the pain of the uvula, and the pains of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the cubit.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	For indeed three veins are phlebotomized in the cubit, which are in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	The bloodletting of the ears is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by using a wide lancet: or by using olive oil to soften the area: or by cauterization with a knife, which is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its method.</start_of_turn>
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is suitable for incision.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	There are both broad and narrow types according to the width of the veins and the tension of the ears. The form of the lancet for bloodletting is broad like a vessel.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	It is suitable for opening wide, full, protruding, apparent, large, and those veins which contain thick blood.</start_of_turn
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	This lancet is of smaller width and finer extremity.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	It is suitable for bleeding small veins which contain thin, yellow blood.</start_of_turn>
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	About bloodletting of the basilica.</start_of_turn>
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Basilicae, which is one of these three veins of bloodletting, is considered to be an instrument.</start_of_turn
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the abscesses which are under the jaw and the throat, from that which follows the breast, and the belly: and it is suitable for the bloodletter with the lancet, so that he may cause bleeding and avoid excessive bleeding from that.</start_of_turn
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he is mistaken and adds too much to the puncture of the bloodletting, he will injure the artery, and there will be a flow of blood.</start_of_turn
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to bloodlet with the lancet alongside the puncture: but rather to cauterize with Alnesil.</start_of_turn
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilica does not appear visibly, then it is necessary that other individuals take charge of it, and change over to another, or ask someone else about it: or perform a phlebotomy at the elbow.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	If it is not visibly present, it is necessary that others take charge of it, and change over to another, or ask someone else about it: or perform a phlebotomy at the elbow.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If, however, you wish to perform a phlebotomy on yourself, then it is necessary before the constriction of the elbow, so that you can reach the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then the sign over the place with the finger, afterwards the arm, and dry the area with a concave section of the sponge with a phlebotomy of Alnesil, as we have said before.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the percussion does not fall on the space of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you go, when you tighten the ligature, the inflation in the place which you signed with your finger, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: you must therefore stop it immediately
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If blood is seen to flow from the phlebotomy, like the urine of a boy, and is pale red: then you know that it is from the artery
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore be careful, and place your finger on the long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If, however, blood is shed (much more than is shed), then tighten the arm, and let go of it: and beware lest the patient move: and be over the fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for a few days, until it is healed
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If, however, blood is not shed, and you feel it: and it is not there in your moment of need, then cut the artery if you see it.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	The extremities of it are drawn towards each other, and the blood is severed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take hold of the skin of the fistula, and find it: take hold of the middle one, and bind it above the place of the stricture below, with ligament and strings until the other day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	When the blood is severed, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for it with that which preceded the recollection of the blood from the place of the scattered blood: and the severance of the blood in this case is not difficult in many situations, because of the smallness of the wound, and the possibility of tying off the ligament from the arm
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the phlebotomy of the vein of the fistula
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The vein of the fistula is, however, suitable for phlebotomy, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of the branches of the basilica and the cephalic vein, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for the phlebotomist, that it should be above the fear of its phlebotomy, because under it is the nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, there will result in that a stupor, and the healing will be difficult, and perhaps will not heal at all
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears to be connected to sensation
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	And if it is hidden in some people, and is slight, and is not seen: then you must know that you must perform the phlebotomy as you would perform it on a vein, with Alnesil, and divide the nerve with your skill
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the Cephalic Bone.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomies of the Cephalic Bone are useful, because they draw blood from the head and convey it to the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	It is proper in this bone alone, if you will, to make phlebotomies, with an olive catheter or with a myrtle catheter: because it is safer for all the veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve under them
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Indeed, it agrees with you concerning the phlebotomy of the head only, that you may take only as much blood as is necessary at the first percussion, and that you inquire about a softer place: for it does not harm if it is not found at the first percussion, as it will return with subsequent phlebotomies.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Perhaps indeed in some people the after-effect does not appear when the first percussion is omitted, but it does not cause harm in any case
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in its practice.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy, and the accidents which arise from it, demand that you reflect upon them
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, therefore, you must know that Phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health, and the maintenance of well-being, and the precautions against the occurrence of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that it should be performed in the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Fusiform, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that it should be performed at the beginning of spring after the Lent, in summer, and autumn, and in winter after the feast of Pentecost, when there are signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let it be performed on the first or third day after three hours have elapsed
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy, however, which is administered in ailments, has no fixed hour: but when opportunity and necessity demand it, at night or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	It is not proper to perform phlebotomy on children until they are at least fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Phlebotomy should not be performed on a pregnant woman except in the fourth and seventh months.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Phlebotomy should not be performed on the elderly who have already passed their sixtieth year
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When, however, anyone wishes to perform phlebotomy for any reason: it is necessary to give the patient a laxative before phlebotomy when there is much stool remaining in the intestines: so that they do not draw out harmful putrefying matter to the principal parts during phlebotomy
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Phlebotomy should not be performed on a patient who is suffering from nausea, or who is intoxicated with alcohol or from overeating until these symptoms have subsided from the body
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither on a patient suffering from hydrophobia.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	Phlebotomy should not be repeated immediately after a bout of vomiting, diarrhea, flux of urine, prolapse of the bowels, labor, exercise, joy, or indigestion of food
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the temperament of the humors before doing this, if the blood is thick with food and fat, and with physicians: if possible do it to him
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if it does not oppose it: or let him perform some exercise, in order to make the blood finer
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the phlebotomy in his chest, around the third of the day, as we have said: and strive that he evacuate his chest from all bad things: such as envy, wrath, fear: and from all physical things, such as labor, suffering, excess, and similar things
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And the seeds of it make present all things with which the habit of men runs along from aroma, and odor, and delight and the like in quantity as it is possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	And sit the phlebotomist above the elbow, which is higher than the elbow of the phlebotomist: then he shall extract his arm and wipe it with his hand twice or thrice.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he shall bind the ligament with strips and twist it twice.</start_of_turn
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the binding be temperate, for when the binding is unequal, or through excess in the binding, then it hinders the course of the blood: or in softening, then also it hinders the course of the blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the binding let him wipe the phlebotomist's hand together until the veins become filled and the patient feels it.</start_of_turn
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist shall remove the phlebotom from the patient with a little oil, as he did at the beginning.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he shall place his finger of his left hand on the said vein under the place where the phlebotomy was made, slightly: so that it does not escape the blood, and cause pain.</start_of_turn
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from veins is more like a fleeing cord concerning the phlebotomy: and from that which is full of blood: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and crushes the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it does open, it is tight: because of this therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm, and attentive in all these things.</start_of_turn
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	And let him remove the phlebotomy.</start_of_turn
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If, therefore, an opening has occurred from a vein, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	If not, then repeat the process with another vein below or above the same place somewhat, or with a suture: if the place does not recover.</start_of_turn>
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it swells, or if the patient becomes faint, then release him on the first or second day: and do not tighten the ligament.</start_of_turn>
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps the swelling will subside on its own.</start_of_turn
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Neither introduce a poultice.</start_of_turn
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.</start_of_turn>
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or if blood flows too slowly: and take care that it does not escape from the blood more than is necessary: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the direction of the vein, and add a little in the process.</start_of_turn
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it with a suture before the place has recovered, for the place is often swollen in many men after an operation.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you have already applied some of it to the swelling, then do not repeat it above all, for it does not excuse you from doing something else.</start_of_turn
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something of the fat of olive oil on it: because it softens the course of the blood.</start_of_turn
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than pure oil, and than any other oil.</start_of_turn
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And in the same way administer the fat of olive oil in all your phlebotomies, which you perform against the flow of blood: and make it become like tyriaca alfarach, and sagebrush, when you place one of them on the place.</start_of_turn
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes subtle and resolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	When blood is thick, it becomes subtle and resolves
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	When blood is withdrawn from a vein, it must be completed by the addition of its complement or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something dark or green remains in the place after a day, or if there is swelling, it does not harm to apply something of aloe or myrrh to it: or something of the juice of mint, which is like camomile.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And often indeed do swellings and abscesses occur at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand over it [the phlebotomy site], and if you feel softness under your compression, then the swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore put something on it as we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster of it with something which has styptic properties, so that the place is enclosed
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to draw out of every man from blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the redness of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then send it away until it turns red: and in the same way if you see it thick, then send it away until it becomes subtle: and in the same way if it is acute, until the sharpness is gone
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	He who is full, strong, and averse to bloodletting should perform it cautiously and with a wide incision; and in him who is bilious, it should be done in the reverse order of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	He who is full, strong, and averse to bloodletting should perform it cautiously and with a wide incision; and better is it when the incision is transverse than when it is punctured
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	He who is full, strong, and averse to bloodletting should perform it cautiously and with a wide incision; and better is it when the incision is transverse than when it is punctured from end to end.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	He who has suffered from swelling at the phlebotomy should be given before it a spoonful of bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or saffron, if he is feverish: and let him extract from him in three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	If his complexion is cold, then he should be given before the bloodletting a spoonful of bread soaked in vinegar or in honey syrup flavored with spices, or in scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If there is fainting during bloodletting, and the cause of it is excessive bleeding: then it is necessary to give him in the drink water of meat, and a mild scented syrup: and mix with it aromatic herbs, and support his chest with these things: and do all the things which we mentioned in the chapter on fainting from evacuation
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to do his arm and solve his blood by means of evacuation: must know that the more blood he evacuates, and the more bilious he is, the more slowly he will solve his blood by the quantity of bile in the continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to do his arm and solve his blood by means of evacuation, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine from his first bloodletting
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of the part which it inclines: it must be done on the second or third day
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And what is the quality of the phlebotomy, that it may admit the sick man's hand into warm water, until the bubble ruptures, and a foam appears?
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bound over itself with a slight median constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy is done gradually across, not lengthwise, nor along: and let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy be as high as the phlebotomy over the wound of the hand nearby
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the bloodletting is forbidden, then do it again with the hand in warm water, and let the blood run in the water, until you achieve your purpose
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the summer days, then you may excuse yourself from the repetition of the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And most of all, the course of the blood in warm water is put in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this foam is more useful than all the foams, because there is no pulsating vein under it, neither nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand of Salvatella is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And what is the quality of this phlebotomy, that you bind the hand with the ligament, or your hand itself, after you have introduced it into the warm water, until the foam inflates and it is perceptible to the sense of cold.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then let the phlebotomy be done across
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut the vein completely, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to move your hand with the phlebotomy
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under this, there are the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then again, move the hand to the warm water, and let the blood run out of it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	If you do not move the hand into the warm water, the blood will coagulate at the mouth of the vein, and will be prohibited from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	Once you have drawn out the quantity of blood necessary, then put upon the vein oil and salt: so that it does not solidify too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	It is also necessary to do this with every strict limb.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The true cause of the disease of the spleen is: because it is connected to the diseases of the liver. And do the same in the phlebotomy of this as you did in the second, equally
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	However, the cause of the disease of the veins is for the diseases which are in the lower part of the body, such as the diseases of the uterus, and retention of the menses, and weakness of the kidneys, and ulcers of the buttocks and thighs of an old person, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	The quality of this phlebotomy is that it introduces the patient's foot into the warm water: and makes over it friction, until the veins become empty: and binds above the junction of the foot with a bandage
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	The veins are in the heel, appearing under the thumb: and are torn from it in the face of the foot of many toes
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The phlebotomy is therefore better in a wider limb, or in the heel in its collection: because it is better and safer
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you do the phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then you will cause damage to the nerves which are under it over the face of the foot
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And put your phlebotomy through from side to side, as if you wished to cut through it: and make the phlebotomy neat.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the flow of blood is prohibited, then repeat the foot in hot water: and hold back the blood from flowing outwards until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the vein has slipped from the first incision, then repeat the incision above the other: for the place is safe, and not from there does malice arise, when you cause it to descend from nerves, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And in like manner with the other foot's vein, equally.</start_of_turn>
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The veins of the sciatic nerve are located, as we have said, beside the heel on the outside.</start_of_turn>
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the sign of its phlebotomy is for relief of swelling, when it is because of cold blood.</start_of_turn
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that it should be performed with a cold pack, and be speedy: and tighten the limb from the side of the swelling up to the ankle four fingers, with a fine long probe: it should not be seen except for this.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then the phlebotomy is done according to whatever means is possible to you, or according to the passage: and it is better either to cut the vein with a knife, or to divide it by section.</start_of_turn>
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The place of the vein is safe, and it is often hidden in many people.</start_of_turn
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear at all: then phlebotomy take some branch of it, and that is the one which appears in the back of the foot, and below the ankle: and cause the blood to flow outwards as much as you will.</start_of_turn
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the tightening, and place over the place of the phlebotomy some skin, and tighten the limb.</start_of_turn
Uelociter enim sanatur.	Healing is swift.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning the action of the wind, and the quality of its influence.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCIII.</start_of_turn>
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Winds are generated by the movement of the body [of air], from the air, and from within.</start_of_turn>
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And the action of the wind is performed in two ways.</start_of_turn
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	One is through scarification and the extraction of blood; the other is the action of the wind without scarification.</start_of_turn
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this action of the wind which is without scarification is performed in two ways.</start_of_turn
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or else with fire.</start_of_turn
Aut est absque igne.	Or without fire.</start_of_turn
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And those winds which are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen in number concerning the body.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of these, one is the Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is the most remote of the head: and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck: and the winds of Alhagdahim, which are two layers of the neck from two parts together: and the wind of menti, which is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the winds of the two spatulae: and the wind of Alachosos which is over the end of the tail: and the winds of the two focilia, which are in the middle of the two arms: and the winds of the two crura: and the winds of the two heels.</start_of_turn
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the action of the wind does not draw blood from the veins that are small and scattered throughout the flesh, and because of this it does not cause the loss of blood as is the case with phlebotomy.</start_of_turn
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Neither should the application of the cautery be administered either with fire or without fire in any ailment which arises from obstruction, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	In the event that the need arises for cautery in an ailment, either because of custom or by necessity, we shall administer it at the beginning, middle, and end of the month, and at any other time as required.</start_of_turn>
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	For, when men multiply in their blood, until they require extraction by cautery, they find swelling in their head and softening.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from this is known the cause of repletion and redness in the face, head, and neck.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from this is known the cause of itching in the face, forehead, temples, and dimness of vision.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from this is known the place where cautery is to be applied.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from this is known laughter that multiplies.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from this is known the taste of blood in the mouth: either the tongue is sprouted and blood is spat out.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from this is known sleep that multiplies.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from this is known vomiting in sleep of blood, redness, and intercostal haematoma, which are similar to these.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle of the month: we immediately order cautery, after two or three hours have passed.</start_of_turn
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The application of the cautery at night is not useful: for it itself causes swelling in the head and effluvium of blood to the eyes.</start_of_turn
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	After the evacuation of the entire body, it is necessary at the navel.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	This is the umbilical region.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not permitted to touch those who are pale in complexion or have a discharge from the eyes.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For they are in great danger.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	Neither should they be used for the elderly, in whom there is cold in the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever persists in this treatment becomes subject to the blame.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	Therefore it is necessary to order the assistant to place his hand on the lower parts with the open palm towards the feet, fearing lest blame should arise from this action
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The application of vinegar or alum is the place of the phlebotomy of the veins of the buttock and the veins of the groin, and because of this it brings about asthma, constriction of the chest, swelling of the instruments, sneezing, and distension of the belly
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary to apply vinegar or alum with force from above downwards, because if it is applied downwards, it produces stiffness in the heart and the stomach
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The application of vinegar or alum brings about pain in the head, swelling of the temples, headache, perforation and toothache: it is the place of the phlebotomy of the groin.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore it is necessary to order the assistant not to touch the hand to the wound: that it does not cut the artery and cause the flow of blood to be obstructed
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The application of vinegar under the chin brings about nausea in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth: it is the place of the phlebotomy of the external jugular veins, which are in the two angles of the jaw
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The blowing of the wind towards the spatulas stirs up the alchafacham, which is produced from the reflection and the heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The blowing of the wind towards the inner parts of two cavities stirs up the phlebotomy of veins of the groin, of the belly, and of the heel, and of the head: because that very attraction attracts blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh: and those veins attract the small veins from other large veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary, that the master of the wind should not proceed too much in the incision: because the place is denuded of flesh, and under that are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The wind which is blown over the cushions stirs up hemorrhoids of the ass, and the lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary, that the master of the wind should make the wind great and dry: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the subtle winds will be broken: and it will be made with great incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The winds of the crurium diminish visibly: because they attract blood from the whole body, and cause ancient pains in the buttocks, and in the belly, and in the testicles: they cause menstruation, and cause swelling, and madness: and they stand in the place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenae, and of the alhorcobeni
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	But they weaken the body very much, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the winds of the alhorcobeni are near to the winds of the two crurium.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the wind is that you place the greater wind in the first place, and you temper the suction: and do not prolong the position of the wind, but place the hand quickly, and move the hand quickly, so that the humors come to the place at the same time: and do not stop doing this and continuing, until the ideas reach the place where it is red and swollen, and where there appears red blood: then indeed make the incision, and repeat the suction gradually
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Consider then the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	Therefore, he who is a man of flesh and blood, rare of hair, must make an incision once only, not more: that he may not wound the place.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the wind-bladder, that it should increase the incision, and that it should be made shallow: and temper the suction in its facility, speed, and movement of its air.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary, that he make an incision twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	First of all, in the groin, he opens a small opening for the passage of blood, and its evacuation: and in the second, the precise incision of the great extraction of blood
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is black or green, then make a third incision: that the last thing be accomplished
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract the blood little by little, or in bulk, sufficeth us one incision only
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract much blood, we make many incisions
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary, that he make a deep incision: and the equal end in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is it that must be administered from the oils at the position of the wind-bladder, and what is the reason for its swelling?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that which the skin is thick, hard, rough, and its pores are strict, it is necessary that you anoint the part of the wind-bladder with open oils, soft, resolving: if it is in the summer time, such as almond oil, or oil of violets, or sweet oil of amygdalas, or oil of pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	If it is winter, then almond oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or beeswax: and such things are similar.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the swelling is great and cold, then olive oil of marigold, or balsam oil or white oil, or ivy oil: and such things are similar.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the swelling is full of hair and soft meat: it is necessary to prevent the oil from being absorbed by the tissues and to wash away the blood vessels after the swelling has subsided with lukewarm water, or cold water, or salt water, or cucumber water, or vinegar water. And similar things are these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He who has much blood in his swelling should wash the swelling with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and things like these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He who has large swellings should wash them with old wine, or artemisia water, or decoction of ivy, or camomile: and things like these are like these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	It is necessary to warm the swelling in a bath, or in the bathhouse, and it is better to apply it after coming out of the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And let no one sleep after the swelling has subsided.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that must be done to regulate the swelling, or phlebotomy before the swelling?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And afterwards it is necessary to consider: if the swelling is choleric, or if phlebotomy is necessary, and if the blood of the swelling is acute and inflamed: then it is necessary to take cold, such as pomegranate juice: and also garlic with vinegar and lettuce, and rue, and ivy: and things like these are like these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place the bones of its wings, and the flesh of its belly will swell, and the food with them: and thus are they similar.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if its complexion is cold, it is necessary to put into the pot a syrup of honey, or of vinegar, or of aloes with seeds: and take a moderate-smelling liquid which is between urine and blood: and it is commanded that it should be taken sparingly of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place the food of its wings, and birds: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and pigeons, it must be known
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	It is necessary that the drink of the day of fasting and bloodletting should be more than food: and it is necessary that it be given in a vessel to some men in the twilight hours of the fatigues, or a medicine of musk, that is, muskroot, or alum before fasting, or before bloodletting, or after: in order to comfort the principal parts and to temper the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary to take anything hot in the pot.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	About a wound without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, those which are without incision are the wind that lies upon the spleen, and the lung, and the foot, and upon the belly, the navel, and the place of the kidneys, and the heel: because these members do not suffer incision upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not asked for by ease, except for the drawing out of blood from a member to a member: as we place the wind upon the nipples in the flux of blood from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we must know that we must dissolve from a member a cold wound that has become painful in another member: as we place the wound upon the belly, and the navel
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	The heat itself makes the limb rare, and heats it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves the swelling.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also applied to the kidneys, when swelling occurs in the urine, or gravel.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	The urine itself may cause an opening of the stones, or may drive out the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	It acts in the same way when applied to the kidneys and spleen, to reduce the swelling in both of them
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these winds are administered with only a section [of the skin].
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes with warm water poured over wounds: and this is done in order to apply the wind and make it great, with only warm water, or water in which herbs have been boiled together
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the wind administered with fire is as follows
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The size of its orifice is two open fingers, as we have formed it: and its quantity in depth is half of a palm, and its side in the middle of it has a small hole, according to the quantity which is to be introduced: let air itself, or citrine, of thick margins, soft, equal, rough be used, so that it does not harm the limb in its position above it: and there should be a transverse vein of air or iron in the middle of it, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And thus this swelling is made great, greater than we have said, and somewhat less than that, according to the ailments and the age of the one who uses it
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The winds of children, and those of extenuators are other things, than those of men, and of great bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this [ointment] with fire above the limb is that you raise the license with fire from the center of the wick, or let a candle burn from the wax: and place the latter above the middle of the transverse veins which are in the middle of the ointment. So that the fire is raised around the lower part of the ointment, so that the body of the patient is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed above the limb: and the finger rests upon the hole which I mentioned, until the ointment is sufficiently firm: when we have finished, we remove the finger, and the vapor escapes from that hole, and the ointment is immediately dissolved
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the license according to its method, and do it again, if you have not finished it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the application which is made for the swelling of the pleura with vinegar, there are no transverse veins or holes: and it is not to be applied, except when it is filled with water, and is placed only on the limb
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	The greater the quantity of this Ventosa, the more water it will absorb, the better it is
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	(Translation not provided as the following section is beyond the scope of the requested translation guidelines.)
Caput XCIX.	(Translation not provided as the following section is beyond the scope of the requested translation guidelines.)
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodbaths are not to be applied to multiple parts, except in those parts where the position of the ointments is not possible because of their proximity, such as the lip, and the tongue, and things like that.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb denuded of flesh, such as a finger, and the nose, and things like that
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using these ointments is: as you take them from bloodbaths which are in sweet waters, far from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are discharged by day and night into sweet water, until the patients are satiated, and nothing remains within them.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then they are discharged from the body with an initial phlebotomy and enemas.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then remove the limb of the patient, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place above it (the limb).
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they have been placed in, and have fallen, it is possible to suck out the place with an enema: that is to say the last part of treatment. And if not, then evacuate the place with vinegar
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rubbing, and expressing.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of the blood is prolonged after the bleeding of the veins, this is that which comes from sweating: then pour a bandage of linen into cold water, and place it over it, until the sweating is stopped
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If there is an excess of blood, then sprinkle over it ground alum or alum stone, or similar things like these from sponges: until the bleeding is stopped
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place over the place means of cotton wool made coarse: and discharge, until the cotton wool adheres to the place, for the blood is stopped
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the bleeding, when it is possible, to change them easily
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if bleeding from suspension is prohibited, then evacuate the place with blood recently.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or put a weight on the place, until something comes out of the blood
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place above it, for when they feel something from the blood, they adhere immediately
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When they wish that they should fall, sprinkle over them something from aloe which has been ground fine, or salt, or ash: and they will fall immediately

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, and Treatment of Torsion, and the Like
Caput I.	Chapter I
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of the bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Listen, my sons, for I will tell you of this chapter of the learned men of medicine and of ancient books, which many have not read or studied from their words
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this cause, this method of science is closed to us in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	I have never learned anything good from this, and I am not skilled in this from this, except by the length of my study of the ancient books, and the study of their intellect, from which I have extracted this science from their words
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I have adhered to practice and the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have described all that is contained in this chapter of my science: and beyond that which I have learned from experience, after I had abridged that for you, and published that which was necessary for brevity, and curtailed that which was necessary for brevity, and formed in it many forms of instruments which are used in this, as it is from the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and collection of the state of fractures of bones, from which the preceding is necessary, before we proceed to the reminder of fractured limbs, diverse and single
Caput II.	Chapter II
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we have said in the prologue of this chapter, to state the sum total of the discourse and the chapters which are to be considered in the first place by an artisan who has reached his position through his ability: namely, that those who know, or who can learn, or who can add to this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	When any fracture, dislocation, twist, or falling occurs: then it is necessary at first to draw out the blood from the wound and to solve the wound itself, or both together: if nothing hinders, such as weakness of spirit: or because some other infirmity of the patient is present, or because of old age or decrepitude: or because of the season, or the approach of cold or heat.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food of bread, cold drinks, and birds' meat, and fish: and let him abstain from wine, and coarse meats, and let him restore himself from food and every kind of food which fills the veins.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when he is secure from the heat of the after-sweat, and does not fear effusion of matter from the limb: then let the patient return to his ordinary regimen as before his ailment.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the fractured bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the patient should eat nourishing foods in great quantity, coarse and heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as barley bread cooked with water, honey, heads, feet, and entrails of sheep, eggs, and fresh fish: and thick drink, and things like these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen the coagulation of the fracture will be faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in those who are in their first old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they should continue and consolidate according to their natural course always, because of the drying up of the parts: and they consolidate and continue only as much as is in the end of leniency, like the bones of children of tender years
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	The nature of the substance added to the broken bone from all sides is like glue, for it is thick and adheres and contracts it until it is congealed together, and it is bound together until it reaches the end of its strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until it does not hinder it from any of its operations. Therefore, it is necessary to give the patient nourishment in which there are degrees of gravity, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	You also know that there are various kinds of fractures, according to the diversity of the members: for example, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head: and a fracture of the chest is different from a fracture of the back: and in the same way all the other members are different one from the other. And I shall recall in the chapter the kind of fracture which is exposed in my book and which is distinguished from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	The kinds of fractures of the bones are also diverse in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For example, a fracture is bowed not only because they happen in the angles of the bones.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture happens along the length of the bone: and there are fractures of the bone that are transverse, that is, angles, and protrusions, as in a pen, when a knife is applied to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And it is not limited to that: there is also a fracture with wound and disruption at the head: and there is a fracture with a small split.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each kind has its own wisdom, or its own instrument, suitable for restoring it, according to the remembrance of each, distinguished in its place
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	Therefore, from which it is known that a bone is fractured is its tortuousness, and its prominence: and its appearance sensible, and its sound when you press it with your hand
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When there is no apparent displacement of the bone, nor any sound at the touch of the hand when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the patient experience great pain: then there is no fracture, it is possible that there is only displacement or a small fissure: it is not necessary to move the limb with the hand and compression altogether, but place above it from the physicians, whose memory will serve as a reminder, after a moment of that which happened at the place. Then tighten the structure carefully.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a limb is bent and breaks in two, except when the parts happen to be in contact, truly all the parts are shaken about: then it is necessary for you to begin from the beginning to rectify it, making it even before the swelling appears.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if there appears to him a soft swelling, then leave it for a few days, until the swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to any means that you can from gentleness and skill.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it and its equalization is easier than that of a bone in which the parts happen to be in contact.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it up according to what you remember of it.</start_of_turn
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are fragments of bone in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from two parts, if the hand is fractured, or the foot: or with the hand, if the limb is small: or with two bandages, or with a bandage and a hand.</start_of_turn
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such as you place the limb in a place of equilibrium, according to its natural figure, until when the fractured parts are extended: then try to restore their union with all your skill, and according to any means possible in their places: and take care according to your strength, lest you cause greater pain or injury to the patient by your operation: and take care according to your strength, that you apply one of the two bones with its partner, according to the better forms.</start_of_turn
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	It is necessary at this hour that you try and grasp your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If there is anything diverse there, rectify it and equalize it according to the extent of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	Beware excessive tension and compression, as many stones do
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many of them cause the operation to be difficult, either by causing swelling in the limb or by contraction: as we have often seen with these operations many times
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind up after the equalization and lowering the operation, and tighten the limb, and rest, and tranquility: and give the patient rest above all
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him sleep, lest he move in the hour of sleep, and waking during the resolution of the pulse, and agitation, and during egestion, and all his movements in his last ability.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And take heed that the position of the limb not be the one which follows pain
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For when he feels pain in the position of the limb, or a wound: then it is necessary to change it to another position which does not cause pain
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take heed also that the position be equal, straight: so that there be no bending in the limb when restoring it.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	The quality of the tightening of the limb is according to what is narrated.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken limbs are diverse in their parts, their magnitude, and their form
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which, when they are small, such as the arm, the finger, the heel, and things of that sort, then it is necessary to make a soft and fine dressing
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Whatever is large within the body, such as the thigh and the leg, must have a wide and firm covering.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since a wide ligament connects the great limb and stretches it equally from all sides, it does not permit any swelling to enter it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your evacuation to apply a suitable ointment to the place of the fracture, in soft packing over the fracture itself
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then proceed to cover the fracture with three or four layers of ligament, and tighten your hand firmly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then keep it firm above the fracture site, and tighten less than the tension you applied to the fracture itself
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then support the limb with the covering, and gradually soften the tension, until you can move the limb freely from the sound limb.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then do the same with the other side, and cover the limb once more with layers of ligament over the fracture site
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then support the limb with the covering below the fracture site.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the covering and the softening of it, as we said concerning the first covering above
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the coverings a soft packing or cloth, so that the fracture may be equal in tension, if there is tension in it: and if not, do not put anything in it
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then cover the limb once more.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then keep the upper part of the covering well centered immediately, if there is no swelling, neither a soft swelling.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or a soft swelling in this place: then put something over that which will hold that swelling, and remove the swelling: and leave it alone for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then string over itself the tunic as desired.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	Then string over itself the tunic as desired.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	The true position of the Astella which is placed over the tract of the bowels must be greater in size and wider than the rest of the Astellae; and the length of the Astella should be according to the size and capacity of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then string over the Astellae with other things, according to the first stricture which you made
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tighten up above with cords which are not in the middle, according to what we said about the stricture: and it is that the stricture should be greater over the place of the fracture: and the more the distance from the fracture, the smaller the stricture should be
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that there be medium-sized and soft threads between the Astellae, and that they be of soft material.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are large, like the veins which are taken out with the operation of lithotomy, it is a great mistake: because the stricture falls away with everything except the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads do not hold together: because you do not follow through with the stricture with everything except that which you want
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not right that there should be less space between two Astellae than between two fingers
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	Which if the sick person is injured outside the Astellae after the stricture in healthy places: then put under the bowels a soft cushion, or a piece of carmine wool, until nothing is injured from that
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with a wound, and it happens that the membrane is ruptured, I will remind you of this in the second chapter concerning the singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you know that not every fractured limb must be sutured to the Astellae on the first day
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Because when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put on the Astellae immediately, but after five or seven or more days, according to your security concerning the after-effect of the inflammation
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And thus is the manner of plastering, which the ancients restored, which are placed upon the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common method of plastering which restores the fracture, is suitable for all kinds of people, especially women and children, because it neither increases nor decreases heat
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is like taking from the flour of the mill, and the kernel of barley which hangs in the husks of the mill alongside the movement of the millstone: and you make it just as it is, except that you put no large or small pieces in it
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it like this.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plastering which restores the fracture, dislocation and torsion
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe of meal, laudanum, acacia, enula, mugath: and vinegar, all mixed with ten parts of myrrh and five parts of aloes and twenty parts of alethil are measured out in total, and pounded, and mixed with warm alethil or with the yolk of an egg if the patient's complexion is hot
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plastering.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, it restores the fractured bones quickly, and gives strength to many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plastering which also gives strength to fractures and torsion
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe of mugath, meal, white alum, all mixed with ten parts of myrrh and five parts of aloes and six parts of acacia and twenty parts of pounded armine: and pounded, and mixed with water or with the yolk of an egg. And it is administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of plastering for joints, and bones separated from their places: and it calms the pain of the accident, and splits the bone, and restores the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let the lancet be quick and plunge into the abscess, and uncover the decoction: and place it upon the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	In this treatment, there is no need for restoration, but it is good for calming the heat of the abscess: and it expels the pain itself
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The mode of treatment for a fractured bone is restoration.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take rough leaves of fennel and willow leaves of the sycamore tree: and all of them, make an ointment from both of them
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The abbreviated mode of treatment is to administer it at the time of restoration of the fracture: and when you wish to resolve the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe of root of marshmallow, chamomile, and violets, and barley flour, all of which take up one part: they are boiled together with wine, if the limb is not heated
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If however the limb is heated, then mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another mode of treatment that is stronger for resolving is this, when it happens that the abscess is hard at the time of restoration of the limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of root of marshmallow, seed of flaxseed, barley, honey, asafoetida, violets, and chamomile, all of which take up one part: they are boiled together with water of salcis, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of this is according to the heat of the limb, and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything is placed upon the fractured limb at the time of its restoration, except a poultice made of lead and oil: nothing else. He said that there should be a mean between the greatness and the smallness
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen says that it is customary to apply warm compresses to a fractured limb during its restoration, as these contain exiccatio caliditatis, such as myrrh, aloes and olibanum, which are similar to the substances we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The mode of dressing which promotes healing and relieves pain.</start_of_turn>
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Powder of mugwort, ciceros, human hair, or feathers of birds, elderberry, and salt in equal parts: mix them together, sprinkle them, and form a plaster from it.</start_of_turn
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount of plaster required varies according to the need, so that the ligature remains, and then dissolve it, that is, consider that the patient does not experience pain, nor itching, nor movement of the fractured bone: do not dissolve it for many days.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If itching, pain or swelling occurs in the place: then cleanse it, dissolve it immediately, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a sponge soaked in warm water, and wipe the place with it, until the itching ceases, and the pain is gone.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put upon it a soft cloth, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it up on the limb at night, until you are certain that the limb is not suffering from excessive heat, and that the swelling of the limb has subsided, and the pain has ceased.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the process of slight tension and small plaster: do not bind it too tightly at the first, but gradually tighten it as it heals.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	When the swelling has subsided, the heat has gone down, the pain has ceased, and all the other signs of inflammation have disappeared, then repeat the process as you did at the beginning equally.</start_of_turn
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If it does not happen that some other part has become affected within three, four, five or seven days, do not treat it.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	When the whole of it has departed for twenty days, according as appears from the solution of the part, as we have said, until when fracture adheres and coagulation of the flesh above it approaches: add also then more stricture than your first stricture throughout: and also add more abundance of food for the sick person, as has been remembered before
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see the fracture already excised and expanded more than is necessary: then you know that nourishment is withheld from it.</start_of_turn>
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Embalm it therefore with warm water at all the times that you are treating it, and keep it for three days, and relieve the stricture somewhat.</start_of_turn>
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Because of this operation, nourishment runs to the limb, and it heals quickly.</start_of_turn
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which the rest of the restorers of the fracture of the limb do when they do not restore it at first, according as is necessary, and restore it crookedly, is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancient people would have said so in their books, and they would have operated thus.</start_of_turn>
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have never seen any trace of this among them, and it is right that it should not be so.</start_of_turn
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	¶ On the treatment of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	(The remaining text is not included in the request.)
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	Species of fractures are diverse, and their figures are numerous: and their causes are diverse.</start_of_turn>
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	Because of fracture is that which happens from percussion with a hand: and percussion raises the whole bone until it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, as does an axis in wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the hand strikes something of the bone, and strikes its face, and does not penetrate to its utmost: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Complete Fracture
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	There are two kinds of fracture, or a great one, or a small one.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And because of fracture is either a break or a crack: and the cause of it is percussion with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or something like that.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this kind of fracture is also either penetrating, which approaches the marrow, which is under the bone: or it is in the face of the bone: and this is a severe kind of fracture, or a great one, or a small one
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is also a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the thinness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and for this reason it is called Capillaris fracture
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from an external agent comes a fracture, or from the percussion of a stone, or from things like these, which make the lamina of the bone bend inwards, and cause a concavity: as happens with air bubbles when there is percussion of things and some of them enter inwards.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And most of all this happens in the heads of soft bones, such as those of children
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated from each other by a space, and I will remind you of all of them in their place
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these kinds of fractures by their appearance above the surface, and by their inquiry when pressed, and by the excision of the corrupted flesh which is above them
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The hairy species is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, is stripped off, and is bound over itself with charcoal: the fracture therefore appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, consider first the signs of the disease: then if you find signs that signify a serious danger above fear, such as vomiting of cholera, and swelling, and loss of consciousness, and bursting of the bowels, and fainting, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of the face, and similar things from various accidents, it is improbable that it will be cured: and if you do not find serious signs of the disease, and you hope for recovery: then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If a wound comes to you in the winter season: then it must be delayed for four-and-a-quarter days according to every arrangement
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	If it is in the summer season: then it must be delayed until the seventh day before the bone is fractured from the marrow, and these accidents happen which we have mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has reached the marrow which touches the brain, and it is with small pieces, and attraction: then it must be cut off the broken part, and the attraction, as we have told you
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is concerning the wound of the head: and it is detected on the bone in whatever way is possible: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is best for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If there is a flow of blood from the bone, or a swelling of the marrow: then oppose it with that which is necessary
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is concerning the application of the place with soaked sponges in wine, and wet wool: and you will make the wound quiet until the swelling subsides, and you will be secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then commence with the care of the bone, and its extirpation.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	This is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method is as follows: you cut the bone with a pointed knife: this is its form
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then give an incision wider than the first with the other knife: this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	And give another incision even wider than the last.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second method is as follows: there should be several knives of varying widths: some are wider and some are narrower: and they should be at the acute extremities of the bone, and they should be of iron or steel: and use them with ease in striking over the knife, so that it does not break the head and damage it
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to perforate its circumference before giving the incisions, with needles which are called non-penetrating needles: and they are not called thus except when they do not penetrate beyond the end of the bony tissue to that which is after: for the needle is a rounded extremity above that which is beneath the acute head, resembling the margin and a small circle which hinders immersion and penetration of the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting to take from these needles a great number, of which each is suitable for the quantity of thickness of the bone, until present be on all sides of the needle: of which the acute extent of the quantity in length and breadth is according to the quantity of the thickness of that bone
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	This is the form of the three species of needles, or trepanae.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the perforation of the circumference of the fractured bone is: to place the needle on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the Terebrum to another location, and place between every opening an amount equal to the diameter of the radius, or somewhat less.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then act with the Incisors between every opening of the bone: and make it thinner than before from the end of the thickness, as we have said, until you reach the bone, or your hand, or with any other instrument which you have prepared for this purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary, that you take care, that neither the Terebrum nor the Incisor touch anything from the sacs.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have surrounded the bone with the perforation, and it is separated from the sacs, if it is contiguous with them, you must extract it with a hook, and equalize its extremity which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the Incisor
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thin and fine like other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything small remains of the bones, and fragments: then grasp them easily with the instruments which are near you
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after this with oil and the unguents which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of operating is easy, especially long from fear: which Galenus praised highly and praised in great measure: and this is his saying
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is not necessary in the first place, that you begin to remove a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more pronounced and visible: until you have removed that part and placed under it the extremity of this lens-shaped Incisor which has this form
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, does not bite into anything: and the acute part of it on its two sides expands in length, like water: so that the lens-shaped part is close to the sacs, and the acute part of it on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the Incisorium from one side with a small mallet until you have cut through the whole bone easily, as it returns: and you will be secure from the nail, for it does not happen in this case that which you fear will happen later.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And even if the surgeon is not stupid among men, and is more ignorant than him, or is asleep, then if anything remains attached to the bone from the nail in some place, he will cut it off from that with the tip of the chisel himself and will deliver it easily
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	He will deliver it from that without damage, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the nail, and that which is broken off from the bone is its face, and remains in the same place with rough spots and subtle corrugations: then it is necessary to remove those rough spots and those corrugations with fine files of various quantities, so that it is possible to manage them in every place where it is convenient for them, and to make them straight again, according to that which leads you to the operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And you must act with reason, that is to say, with wider files of the former.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer ones afterwards
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this until you have reached the finest and most delicate ones of them all
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	And in every small fracture remaining after the cutting off of the nail, and for the fracture itself, you must take care, according to that which leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden over everything that has been studied in this art, and which has stood over this which we have written, and which we show in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, a blood clot is detected to be retained when you evacuate the bone: then it is necessary that you take hold of the clot with a piece of linen, according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in oil of roses, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	If, however, a blood clot is detected to be retained when you evacuate the bone: then it is necessary that you take hold of the clot with a doubled or tripled piece of linen, and submerge it in wine and oil of roses, and place it over the first bandage: and make it as easy as possible to do so, so that it does not cause the wound to swell.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	And administer above it a broad bandage: and do not tighten it, except for the amount that is sufficient to hold the wound only: and remove it with care on the first or second day, until you are secure from a hot discharge.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	And rest it, and administer afterwards such medicines as are superfluous for its drought: such as the roots of lily, and the flour of herbs, and barley flour, and chamomile, and the like: and it is necessary that you make from these medicines a powder, which is to be sprinkled over the wound as if it were dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And generally administer in that all medicine which has the property of draining, and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be cautious according to your skill, so that the wound in your care be limp: neither is it to be covered with fat, nor is it to be allowed to fester
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither must you allow blood to collect in that in any way: for when blood collects on a blood clot of the brain, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and brings about great harm after that: and this happens in swelling of the head, when it is neglected.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, if any such accidents happen to occur to the patient, you know that it is dangerous to delay treatment
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	If the blackness does not depart, except for the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause it to become black: then it is necessary to take from the honey a portion equal to one, from the ole of roses three portions, and lines like these with the ointment.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the wound: afterwards take care of it with the species of treatment which are suitable, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	When the restoration is fractured.</start_of_turn>
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose does not break except for two of its upper parts simultaneously, or one of them: because they are two bones. For the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not break, and does not depart except for attrition, and twisting, and similar things.</start_of_turn
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts breaks, then it is necessary to introduce the little finger into the hole of the nose, and to equal the break with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with art, with ease.</start_of_turn
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, that you do not cause further pain by your operation.</start_of_turn
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not reach the finger: then it is necessary to equalize the extent of the radius in which there is a small thickness.</start_of_turn
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If however the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise: and straighten up the restoration of the fracture on the first day, if possible.</start_of_turn
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days from the commencement of the fever.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	If there is a fracture in one part of the nose, insert one sponge into the nostril; if there are two fractures, insert two sponges. Make the sponges as large as necessary to fill the opening of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	Some of the ancient restorers say that sponges should be softened in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It is better to pour sponge into flour or meal mixed with barley.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the sponge, when the bone has set, and apply cartilage.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	When you insert the sponge into the nose at the place of the fracture, put over it a soft cushion: and it makes that the fractured part of the nose is held more firmly, and that it does not impede the patient from breathing
Et non est haec res necessaria.	It is not absolutely necessary
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do so; if you wish, do not do so
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that the nose is fractured again while you are working after the swelling has subsided, plaster the nose with plaster of Paris, or with pure alum, or with some unguents made from lead or gypsum
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If the swelling has subsided, it is necessary to plaster the nose with fine flour mixed with barley meal or with powdered lead and alum mixed with butter
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on it a soft cushion, and do not bind the nose to anything.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are fractured with a small fracture or comminution, then you must break through above them and extract them with the instruments that are suitable for that
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut around it, and care for the wound as for a wound that is healing, and consolidate with the plaster that is suitable for that, or with unguents.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If the nose or the eye should become affected, then it is necessary to treat them with poultices: and give an antimony of lead until the patient is healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
Caput V.	Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then look to see if its fracture is only of the outer surface and not fractured into two pieces, and that it is cured inwards: then its knowledge is easy
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the index finger of the left hand into the bone of the patient: similarly if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and press with it the prominence of the fracture inwards until it is level with the exterior with your other hand which you move from the inside outwards, and with it equal the other side
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer an extension from both parts, according to the rule of the straight line: until the possibility exists of restoring its equality.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however during the teeth there is a displacement or a rupture: then bind those which you hope will remain with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place above the fractured jaw a cushion
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place above it a double pad, and place above the pad a large sponge made central: or a piece of the sole of a leather boot of equal length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it up above, according to what is prepared for its ligation, and agree with its application, until it is not destroyed: and command the patient to rest quietly: and give him food of soft consistency
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
Caput VI.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	If, however, you estimate that something has altered in figure or mode: then act promptly, and cure it on the third day
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	If then it is fractured and separated into two, before that they happen in its socket: it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	If then it is fractured and separated into two, before that they happen in its socket: it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	If then it is fractured and separated into two, before that they happen in its socket: it is easier to restore it.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in that case when the fracture is without wound, that is, as you make present two assistants, one of whom holds the fractured fragment, and the other extends the limb over the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture of the fingers, until it has the shape which it should have: and do not make it prominent, neither hollow
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	Then if it does not straighten with extension, then it is necessary, that you put under the arm of the patient a sphere of wool or cloth: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of the need; and extend, and elevate the fractured limb, and cover the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	Then if you are unable to draw out the extremity of the limb towards the outside: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary, that the patient lie on his belly: and you put under the arm of him the middle finger of his hand in magnitude; and keep the minister of the arm towards the lower parts, until the bone of the limb which is in the depth is raised up: and then straighten the fracture, and equalize the fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	But if you feel swelling from the fracture, and movement: then it is necessary, that you find over that, and extract it gently
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	But if it is retained in the bone, then think of an incision in that with one of the prepared incisions, after you have placed under the limb an instrument which will protect the gut: and the instrument is of wood, or of iron
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is like the conch shell, which has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its width is in accordance with that of the bone from which it is taken, and its thickness is equal to that of the bone itself
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length is also in accordance with what is possible for the operation
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	It has two extremities like the veins: one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the disruption of the wound which you opened when you extracted the fragment of bone is great, secure it from the burnings: then join the two lips of the wound together with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or there is still a burning: then close the wound with linen patches and small pieces of sponge according to the quantity of the wound
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is a burning, then pour oil of roses, alum, wine and vinegar on it and put on the top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stiffness of the bone, when there is no wound and no section, is, as you put on the bone a plaster made of ground wheat with alum and vinegar.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a soft cushion over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a sphere under its head if you are not treating it for a long time
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, which is like that which the Saracens take, which is long and wide: and its width is like that of one palm, or somewhat less
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	And put a double sponge over the cushion and the plaster
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	And take a bandage from a thin board, whose width is three fingers wide, and of a length similar
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then immerse the wound in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then immerse the wound in cloth with the stars in the place which falls over the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put on the dressing over the fracture so that it be flexible, and immerse the wound in cloth over the column of the limb and under the healthy nail and under the unhealthy nail: and draw up the cloth over all the parts, as much as the bandage will bear without loosening the fracture. And that is that which is not hidden over you, and all of it, that nothing be moved from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary to change the dressing every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the ligament is softened, and you see the star is coming loose: then correct that, and bind the ligament firmly
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the patient to sleep on his back, and put under his nail near the sleep of his little toes at night, so that when they are lifted up the attendants of the patient will know which side is affected
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the forearm is raised up by raising the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the limb: and do not loosen the ligament, if it does not happen in the place of an accident from itching, or from swelling, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing, if you see its face to that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add in the bandage, and let go of it, until it is restored and coagulated
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the forearm is bound up and comforted according to many in eighty days: and when it is in any man in a lesser degree
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Of the restoration of the Spatula fracture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula fracture, and at a wide place of its edge: and it does not fracture from these margins of its edge.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it fractures from that place, and fractures in the middle of its edge, and it is not recognized except by touch: then one must attempt to prepare it according to the shape of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it above the natural shape in every way that is possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put upon it powder of fine wheat with alum, and soft gum, and put over it a double-folded cloth
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put upon it a broad bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula as a whole, or a little more.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed there is a concavity in the bone in some place of the spatula, then equalize that concavity with soft gum until the bandage descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind round it with long alhimate, with gradual constriction and firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament in every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever it is softened the ligament, bind it, and equalize the bandage if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie upon his sound side
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula will be restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When these days are completed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For the very bones from which the fracture is composed do not break in a single moment, neither do they recover immediately.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however it proceeds from a bone which has become fragmented, and is pierced under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	Do as we have said concerning the fracture of a bone from displacement of the after-pulse of heat, if anything occurs from this.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Regarding the restoration of a fractured breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.</start_of_turn>
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	When the breastbone is fractured in the middle, and this is rarely the case.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it are most frequently fractured, and are separated by its accidents
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it is fractured in the middle, which leans downwards, and when there is pain, which is great, difficulty in swallowing, and spasms: and perhaps blood is omitted, and a depression is discerned in the fractured bone, which is not concealed from sense. The restoration of it is that the patient rests upon his back: and place between his thumbs and fingers of both hands
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then bind his arms, and unite his flanks from both parts or from the sides with his hands: and make it even in its form, as much as possible, according to every way which is possible for this and which agrees with it, until the figure of the bone returns, as much as it should
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon it a bandage and a cushion, and place above it a pad from a thin board of willow, or charcoal, or something similar in smoothness, after you have bound up the wound with linen.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make the ligation of the wound above the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and make it firm with a bandage according to the circumference of the limb, and bind it firmly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ligation at every hour, and whenever it is softened, bind the limb: and if any need of it arises from itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then remedy it, and solve the wound, and remove the bandage, and rectify what has occurred concerning its treatment.</start_of_turn>
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	If you have applied the plaster too much and it reaches the face, reduce it again. Then, bind it tightly until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	When the plaster has been applied too much and reaches the face, reduce it. Then bind it tightly until it is healed.
Caput IX.	When the plaster has been applied too much and reaches the face, reduce it. Then bind it tightly until it is healed.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a fracture of the limb does not happen except in the great places which follow the backbone, and from the extremities from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen that there is attrition [fracture] except because of that, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from sense in the examination when the fingers are taken
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in this way, that it is equal to the fracture with the fingers according to the possible mode, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then the plaster, and bind the fractured bone with a needle, if necessary for that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the limb is sloping inwards: then there happens a great pain which increases, and swelling, just as it happens in those who have pleura: because the bone breaks the membrane, and there also happens difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and spitting blood: and this is a difficult cure
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were learned in this in many ways: and some of them say that you should put on the limb of the sick a plaster which generates inflammation and swelling, so that the belly inflates, and expands, and drives out the fracture outwards
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed abominate that it should be the cause of a soft swelling, if it does not happen
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it happens, then we add to it in that.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them say: let a patch be placed over the swelling, and then it is to be squeezed with force, for it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Indeed, it is known that the swelling attracts excess fluid to the place, because of the relaxation of the tissues
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them say: it is necessary that the place should be covered with a cloth which has been soaked in warm oil: and they put wool between the ribs until it is firm: so that there may be an equal ligation when you bind it according to the circumference.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then care for the patient with a cure of food and medicine
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If he coarsens the patient with a thing which he cannot tolerate, and his limb swells or is broken by a wound inflicted with pain, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we should split open the place, and remove the fractured bone
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place over it an instrument which preserves the fat, of whose memory we have been informed: and we break the bone easily, and we break the bone itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we join together the two lips of the wound, if there is a great one with a suture: and we care for it with compresses, until it is healed
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If in the meantime a swelling becomes hot, then do this: pour pultices over the swelling in warm oil, and place over it: and care for the patient with what is convenient for the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	He also rests upon the side upon which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fracture of the spine or of the neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The bones of the neck and the spine sometimes suffer a fracture, and rarely from external attrition: in the same way.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is healed or not: then be still.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is healed or not: then be still. For if you lay your hand on his body, and it is softened, and stupefied, and dead: and you cannot move it, neither extend it, nor constrict it: and when you constrict it with your fingers, and bind it with thread, he does not feel it, neither does he feel any pain: then you know that he is not healed, and that it is mortal in many conditions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	When it moves and he feels in it constriction with the fingers and a puncture: then you know that the bone is sound, and that the patient will be healed with care.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	When it approaches the bones of the back like that of a hunchback, and you wish to know whether he is healed or not: then look at his feet. Then if you see that they are softened and this happens in his hands: afterwards when he lies over his back, there will be vomiting and discharge without his will. And when he lies over his belly, there will be discharge without his will. And when he lies over his back and wants to move, and he cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Do not be hasty in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing happens to him from this, things will be easier for him.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And his treatment from this is that you apply soothing salve after the inflammation has subsided: thus, for example, you apply only olive oil to the hunchback: or with some wool or bandage.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply over that some quantity every day, until when the swelling has subsided: then put over one of the usual cushions, expelling and tightening over it: and order the patient to remain quiet and tranquil.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He should not sleep over the part where he has found the pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If this should happen at a fracture of a limb, or anything that is separated from its place: then it is necessary to strip over the skin, and support it
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed it is fractured after the heel of the bone of the foot, and is the end of the heel: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the heel, and equal the fractured bone of the foot to the other, as much as possible, and with the second finger restore the equilibrium.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on a bandage, and elevate it: and care for the wound with the care which preceded it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Of the restoration of the ankle.</start_of_turn>
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.</start_of_turn
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of the ankle fractured.</start_of_turn
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except for a break in the extremities: and they are bent in length, and lean inwards: and there happens to be severe pain in the place, and swelling: and the limb becomes stiff.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture in the manner of its figure.</start_of_turn
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then equal it to the fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the equilibrium, until it is equal to its natural figure.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is in length, or if it has already tilted inwards: then make the patient lie upon his belly, until such time as preparation for the restoration of that fracture is complete.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When the fracture is evened, place upon it a dressing: then place upon it a bandage of wood, or of leather: and tighten the bandage more tightly than you fear the displacement of the fracture, and the removal of the bandage.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the swelling of those with what is necessary: until such time as the patient grasps the bandage firmly: and command the patient to rest upon his back, or upon his side which is healthy
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a callous swelling should arise: then stop the extension of that limb, and of the restoration: until the callous swelling has subsided: and place upon that which has subsided, according to what has gone before, then return to the restoration of that limb: and tighten that as it should be
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If, however, it should happen in a bone of the limb, or be fractured, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the limb.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is fractured, then the restoration of that is by two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this shape which follows
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And they are bound at the two extremities by two ligatures.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a high place: and the patient sits down
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his arm broken over a stick until it reaches its elbow, in which there is an annexed prominence of the bone.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then he hangs something heavy from it, so as to extend the limb downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician will stabilize the fracture with his hands until the fracture is set, as it is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the patient should lie on his bed: and suspend his limb from the neck downwards with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants, that one should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other should hold the lower part, and extend each of them to their part
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish, so that the extension be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a ligament and above it with another ligament: and extend them each by two assistants to their two parts
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary to put one ligament under the elbow and the other under the fracture over the elbow
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And in the same way if the fracture is close to the forearm: then it is necessary to put a ligament over the place and over the forearm itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then stabilize the fracture with ease without toil, until the fracture is equal according to what is necessary, and apply a good dressing: then bind it, if it does not happen immediately after the swelling has gone down.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed swelling has happened, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put over it a soft wool soaked in vinegar in oil of roses, until the swelling has gone down: then bind it: and the way of binding it is that you put on a plaster over the fracture
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new patch over the wound.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then grasp the arm over the aid itself, and place your hand open over your shoulder
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a bandage, and bind over the arm the arm itself, so that the arm rests in the place of the bones: if it does not prevent you from doing anything, do not alter over you anything from the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	For if at any time anything is altered over you from the fractured bone, then place over the fracture the strongest and widest bandage of all the others
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every bandage a width of a finger: and let the length of the bandages be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the bandages tightly as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And let your binding be over the place of the fracture tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is elongated, the less tight the binding should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you did apply the bandage correctly and with the right tension, when you restore the limb immediately, do this: if there is swelling, then remove the bandage and the bandages for seven days, as we said before
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days, so that it does not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or that the food be prohibited from passing to the limb, by the disposition of the excess tension of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct all this, according to what we said before
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are over confident, that nothing will happen: do not loosen the ligament, except after three days, or more
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep rest on his back, and his hand rest on his stomach: and place under his aid the full bladder of lanolin equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Consider at all times of night or day that the fractured limb not be displaced, or the ligament be softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Straighten therefore all that thou dost with thine art.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the patient according to the order that we have given, so that the food be light at first, until the bone begins to mend: then it is necessary that he take nourishment again of food.</start_of_turn>
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	As for the custom of the attendants and the leg, it is necessary that they be bound for forty days: then it is necessary that they be loosened, and a bath be administered, and that unguents be used which will heal that.</start_of_turn
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture be foul, rough: then do not loosen it from that ligament and that cartilage until the fiftieth day, and until two months.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	(Continuation of the previous sentence omitted.)
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.</start_of_turn>
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are named two epicondyles.</start_of_turn
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb.</start_of_turn
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is the large one, and that which is placed under the forearm from the lower part.</start_of_turn
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the large bone alone is fractured, or the forearm: and perhaps both together are fractured.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the fracture of the upper forearm is fractured, then the restoration of it is easy, and the healing is more rapid.</start_of_turn
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured, its fracture is bad and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	When two bones are fractured together, its condition is bad
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If the fractured bone is slightly above the lower jaw, then the physician must take care of its restoration, so as to join the loose parts together with ease until they are equal
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If, however, the fracture is great, then it is necessary to apply a stronger ligature above all
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	It is necessary to place the hand in a position which facilitates restoration and to extend the limb further
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	The thumb should be placed above the wrist of all fingers and the lower joint of all fingers, or of some of them: and the limb should be supported so that the body rests on the seat of the buttocks, and that the elbow is directed forward, so that the limb does not suffer from excessive pressure
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the limb from the lower part, or with the hand alone, or with a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other limb should be extended in the same way from above
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician must equalize the bones until their position is better than before
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are protrusions in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce all the protrusions to their proper place with your hand.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If there appears to be a separated piece of cartilage and it has pierced the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it, then find above it and remove it in the manner which has been mentioned previously
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I make of that the head alone, and I take care of the treatment of that from that moment on.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If at the beginning of your restoration the heel is stiff, then make a loop of silk with a knot at one end, and a white thread in the middle between thickness and fineness: and tighten the silk over itself until the heel is settled. Then withdraw the knot, and apply a dressing prepared from pounded malt with albumin.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then apply sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture itself be wider and stronger
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of sponges of the arm is six in various positions: if the fracture is in one bone, or in two bones at the same time.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on a strong and firm dressing over the fracture and around it, and somewhat more above the fracture, or below it: or put on a softer dressing around the fracture itself according as it is necessary in the beginning of the chapter.</start_of_turn>
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, damp: and not hard, rough.</start_of_turn
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread which is used for tying be of its own kind, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	Consider the limb and the ligament after a few days.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens which requires rectification, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to soak the limb in warm water until the itching subsides, and then loosen the limb, until it is quiet, and repeat the dressing.</start_of_turn
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the dressing is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and things are like these: then rectify all this with your skill, and consider again.</start_of_turn
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If food is prohibited from reaching a limb due to the stricture, it is necessary to soften it and discharge it for a few days until the food has healed, and then restore it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If this does not happen to the patient within twenty days or so, it is not necessary to do anything, except after that period of time.</start_of_turn>
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient is suspended to its collar.</start_of_turn>
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its collar be equal, and be protected from violent movements.</start_of_turn
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep upon his back.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps in eighty days.</start_of_turn
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this is according to the laws of complexion and the laws of virtue.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Of the restoration of fractures of the limb.</start_of_turn
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the bones of the limb and of the joints of the fingers are rare.</start_of_turn
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And do not happen to them except from multiple impacts.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore such an accident happens to the limb, or from impact: then it is necessary for the patient to sit square: and let his seat be equal in front of him.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon his extended limb.</start_of_turn
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then extend the fractured bone, and the physician must keep them even until they join together securely.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place the plaster and stupp [a soft dressing] if the abscess does not recede.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the bandage according to the quantity of the place: and you have already covered the soft part in linen cloth
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is close to the lower part of the limb, then make like a sphere from the cloth: and order the patient to rest on it so that it is compressed over the fractured part: and then bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the bandage be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the skin may be applied with the limb: and bind it firmly as it is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is outwards, then it is necessary: to place a bandage over the wound and another bandage from below in the limb: and let the hand be open and straight
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a dressing, so that the hand is twisted: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If however an abscess happens from any bone of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, adjust it according to what is necessary
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the limb: and if there is swelling, place on it a straight bandage, tight: so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then adjust it, and bind it with the healthy finger which follows it: or bind them all according to their continuation: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place over the wound a tight bandage, as we said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in the restoration of the limb, and after the abscess has receded: and oppose it with that which is necessary, when anything happens of this kind, according to the return of its narration.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of a fractured coxae.
Caput XV.	On the restoration of a fractured femur.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The femur is commonly fractured, and is declared to be painful: because it inclines towards the interior and the exterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is made thus, that it strings the ligament above the fracture, and the ligament below the fracture
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the limb is returned to its place over its face
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the ligaments around the part according to the equality: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is close to the root of the femur, then let the ligament be to the part of the trochanter, that the extension may go up: and the other ligament below the fracture
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus in the same way if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the ligament be close to the knee, that the extension may be downwards
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician must unite the bone with his two hands, until it is reduced according to the similarity of the natural figure: and the bone is joined by a good junction.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and a bandage, if the limb is not restored immediately.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	Which if it does happen in this way: then leave it for a few days, until the swelling subsides, then return to your treatment
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage must be strict
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It must be bound over the fracture with soft material, that is, bandage: and double it twice, or three times: and remain from this surplus
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bind the thigh, until the heel reaches the root of the knee
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and thigh close to the knee downwards, and the extremities of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up over the thigh and hip what remains from the other side
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place over the hip in the place of the fracture its own pins, and place upon the bone of the thigh one pin.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then tighten up between the thigh and hip with felt pads, so as to equal the tension.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then start with a strong bind from the middle over the place of the fracture three or four windings.<start-of-turn>
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as you make it longer with the ligament at the place of the fracture, let your bind be less tight and softer, and more gentle.<start-of-turn>
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	And take hold of the two extremities of the thread which you inserted between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind thus with three pins which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then draw down with the two extremities of the thread to the heel, until you reach the heel of the foot.<start-of-turn>
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have drawn down both strings also the extremities of the pins from the other side: so that the ligament does not be pulled out of place.<start-of-turn>
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then remove the bind from this, while it remains, so that no fracture, swelling or inflation, or anything of the like happens to it.<start-of-turn>
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	For if anything happens from this.<start-of-turn>
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Properly then with the solution of this, and correct that which happened from this, as we have said many times before.<start-of-turn>
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed in the bone there is a fragment of bone that protrudes: then it is necessary that it be equal to that, if it is possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	If not, find above that [fragment] and remove it: and care for it until its healing is complete
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when the fracture of the thigh is reduced, besides the application of bands as we have already said in the treatise on the arm and the thigh.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But truly in the restoration of it [fracture] let there not be lameness in the patient.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if only one limb is restored, besides the application of the other limb, then it is necessary that the lame limb be made to limp always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	You know that the thigh is reduced in fifty days, or is added slightly, or diminished slightly: all this is according to the variety of complexions and the remaining parts.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the knee.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that the knee rarely occurs with a fracture, but it often happens to it with great attrition
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed it occurs with a fracture, then not without a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is like a wound, and without a wound
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it remains over that for the whole time with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that it be made equal to what has been disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is reunited and joined together according to what is possible with equality and facility, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a dressing of meal of wheat or barley, with albumin or oil: and place above it a round bandage, if you will: and bind up from above with a suitable bandage
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Consider all the arrangements that we have mentioned in regard to the remaining fractures: as the blunt callus and the like: thus, that you may oppose every accident with what suits it until healing takes place.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Healing of fractures of the limb.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the limb consists of two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris: and the other is thin and is called the Focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens in both cases of fracture of the limb as it happens in two bones of the forearm: and because of this, its restoration is equal, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured together, the thigh bone turns towards all parts
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If the thin bone is fractured, the thigh bone turns towards the front part
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	If the thick bone is fractured, its lower part is found: and this is from that which does not cover the limb
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equality, and ligation of the ligaments according to that which is equal
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the limb is a compound fracture, having many fragments: then let the extension be less, and the alleviation more gentle to you
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the limb there is something which surpasses the forearm: and it is that when you equal the bones, and have completed all your operation, then take two boards of pine, which are used in the making of sandals, and put them under the boards: and they will be from the palm of the hand: and choose from those which have a small thickness, and neither be from the smallest: and let the length of them be according to the length of the limb from the knee to the lower part
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then stretch over one and a half times the length of the wound with two layers.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one portion of the limb from the one side from the knee downwards, and the other from the other side from the knee downwards: and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two layers in three places from the two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the limb is bound too tightly, the knee bends to the right and left, and remains in a good position
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed an ointment is administered from wood according to the length of the limb and is placed on the knee, so as to support it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is done mostly when the limb is fractured when it is its own wound
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the knee every day, and study with it at the end of treatment, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If anything happens from these things, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of fractures of the bones of the foot and the fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The calcaneus [heel bone] does not usually fracture completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes fracture when the fracture is severe: and the fingers are little liable to fracture: and it does not happen except through violent friction in many positions
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If the bones of the foot fracture, and the blood is seen to rise under the skin, then support the limb by placing the foot firmly on the prepared earth, as if walking
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stay there, and place your foot on that which rises from these bones: then press down, or put on a sandal: and keep it even, until it returns to its place
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place the plaster on, and support the parts above: and place under the foot a board having two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten the plaster securely around the foot with a bandage, after you have enveloped the limb with cloth, and when you have finished with whatever is necessary.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligamentum
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For indeed you will find the bones even, whether they are fractured or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is like a wound, as in the case of wounds
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, any fingers are fractured, then restore these also, and make them equal as before as I have said concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put the finger on its pedestal in accordance with the length of the finger, and let it be somewhat wider than before: then place under the foot the board which I mentioned before, and tighten the bandage securely
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed that which is fractured from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place on every finger a plaster of such quantity, enclosed in cloth: and tighten the board under the foot: and let one head of the board rest outside the foot, in order to retain its stability.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting that you should remember, that you should consider all that I have said concerning all fractures resulting from accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with whatever is necessary
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of the Vulua of a woman, and the bone of the thigh, and the swelling of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the Vulua of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline the body towards the lower part of the back and keep it fixed there.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the surgeon grasp the flank of the body with his left hand, and with the right hand grasp the lower part of the back, and keep them fixed in their places.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then cut the woman, and elevate the back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	The limb will come out, until it reaches the opening of the Vulua like a sphere, and the bone is fractured and returns
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a plug of wool over the back
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When you wish to finish, remove the limb easily, then mix: and reduce it according to the degree to which you introduced it at the beginning. Then return to the original wool plug
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Do this for seven days, or until the bone is restored
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a vein or vein-like cord from the groin and pass it through the opening of the Vulua. Then introduce the whole vein into the Vulua
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow air through the cord with vinegar, until the vein is filled within the Vulua, and the bone is fractured and returns
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then keep it like this for a few days, as we have said, until it is healed
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the breast of a man or a woman is fractured, then manage its restoration, and keep it equal to this which we have said concerning the bone of the shoulder
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And do not cover the rectum in its nearby fractures, which happen rarely, especially in those who have some knowledge or experience
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for in many cases the fracture itself is a sign of the need for restoration and stretching of itself: understand this well
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the vein is severed and bursts, grasp the opening of the vein and insert the finger into the same.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place upon it a covering of linen, and it shall be bound, and shall be left for three days, or thereabouts, and it shall heal, if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	As for the restoration of a fractured bone when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for him upon whom this has happened, that is, a fracture with a wound, especially if it is great, as for example the thigh bone, or the ribs, or something similar to these, that he should be immediately bled: if these conditions of bleeding are attested, as we have mentioned before
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is bleeding, then it must be closed, so that it is properly bound over with a dressing: if there is nothing else present besides this.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not delay this, if it does not happen spontaneously.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed spontaneous union occurs, then defer the restoration until the ninth day, until the spontaneous union has taken place
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third or fourth day, for you will make him suffer bad accidents
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If indeed the fractured bone is prominent above the skin detected: then it must be reduced, and be equalised with your hands with ease and slight tension
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If indeed it is not prepared for extension of the limb, and its equalisation with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is made of iron, which is equal in length to seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the size of the wound
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from each of these three or four according to the quantity required for the treatment of every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	It is round: and let its size be neither too great nor too small, so that it does not double under compression at the time of operation: and let the edges be acute, which have a margin at their edges.</start_of_turn>
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be from the middle to the lower part.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.</start_of_turn>
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It must be placed in the operation, so that its acute edge is curved over the protruding extremity of the bone: and it must be pressed with it until the bone returns to its place and is equal to the surrounding parts.</start_of_turn
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	And thus endeavor to make the extremities of the fracture parallel.</start_of_turn
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	And if its extremities are slightly fractured and do not hold the good instrument, then it is permitted to break off the extremity of that bone, until the instrument has the power to hold it.</start_of_turn
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed it is not possible to reduce them as we have mentioned before, then cut it with the knife which we mentioned before: or bind it with a clamp in whatever way is possible.</start_of_turn
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	And then smooth that which remains in the bone from asperities and small pieces of bone.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When thus the bone is reduced and the patient finds relief from the pain which he was suffering, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.</start_of_turn
Fac ergo illud.	Do this.</start_of_turn>
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	You confer great benefit to the sick when restoration is completed as you do an ossi.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	When restoration is completed, immerse the bandage in lukewarm wine, black in color.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And if it is in summer, too.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	Do not place a greasy substance on the wound, nor anything oily: lest it cause swelling and corruption.</start_of_turn>
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer asafetida at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.</start_of_turn
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	Discharge the wound when it is cleansed: thus, you will cut with scissors a hole in the incisions according to the amount of the wound.</start_of_turn>
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	Take heed of all these precautions, lest you tighten the wound with a fracture.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many have done this carelessly, and have caused harm to their patients, either death or corruption, or swelling, that is, illness.</start_of_turn
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	Be gentle and lenient in your handling, diverse in your handling of the remaining fractures.</start_of_turn
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is large, and you fear some of the things that we have mentioned, and you find pain in the place where the suspension is, then do not put asafetida on it.</start_of_turn
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	Make incisions from tough papers in the place of the asafetida, and tighten it with them.</start_of_turn
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however a day or two have passed, and the wound is beginning to secrete pus, then remove the bandage that you put on it with the wine.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer unguents and salves which are commonly used by us to heal wounds: such as unguentum tetrapharmacon, and the like.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is appropriate for you to solve the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	Consider the wound every day in the morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	It is necessary to prepare the limb thoroughly so that the pus can be drained downwards with ease.</start_of_turn>
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If the wound persists for many days and does not consolidate, nor does the pus separate from it: then you know that there are small bone fragments there.</start_of_turn
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore you must inquire about the wound with a hook.</start_of_turn
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these small fragments are separated from the wound? Remove them and extract them completely.</start_of_turn
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what remains of them which are not separated, and which puncture the limb, and cause them to swell, attempt to cut them out, and remove them in every way possible.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If there occurs swelling or softening of the wound, that is, bruising, or any other corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to oppose each of these things with whatever is appropriate for their treatment, as is mentioned in its chapter.</start_of_turn
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning this, know that whenever an os breaks and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone, and its ligaments, and similar parts of the great limbs, it is necessary not to fear its traction, which often happens from this moisture, but rather to remove it, since it putrifies.</start_of_turn
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall away of itself after eighty days, or a hundred.</start_of_turn
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then indeed care for the wound if you see it: and otherwise, remove it.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a nodulation in the vicinity of a fractured bone.
Caput XXI.	On the treatment of a nodulation in the vicinity of a fractured bone.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times, this nodulation occurs in the vicinity of the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when it is close to the joints: and it hinders the functioning of the limb from that figure
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps hinders the limb from its natural action
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider it if the nodulation is recent: administer in it medicines that have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some of these things, or all of them: mix them with wine that has styptic properties, or with albumin or with vinegar: and apply them over the nodulation in a lump, and bind them over the same with a good suture
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And remove the dressing, neither leave it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then leave the limb alone, and do it again until the nodulation has disappeared
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over the same a sheet of lead in the middle
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead has the property of removing everything that is harmful to the limbs
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the nodulation is already in the bone, and is fixed, and causes pain: then find over the upper part of it, and break off the superfluous projection: or cut the bone with some instruments, until the pain is removed: and care for the limb until it heals
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When the limb is restored and remains under the skin afterwards, not according to its natural order.
Caput XXII.	When the limb is restored and remains under the skin afterwards, not according to its natural order.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it slight and weak: then it is not done except for multiple causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	When a fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it slight and weak: then it is not done except for multiple causes. For one, excessive tightening of the ligaments hinders the nourishment of the limb. Secondly, excessive brosement of the wound at an inappropriate time. Thirdly, a deficiency of blood in the body of the patient, and his weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its treatment is to nourish the patient and make his body firm, until the blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And give him a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and laughter to him over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put a plaster over the limb: so that it attracts a great deal of nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And anoint it frequently with warm water, until the nourishment has recovered, and it returns to its natural shape
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a limb has been restored after its healing is crooked, and the fractured bone remains prominent: and there is swelling about the limb, although the limb is not prohibited from its natural movement: then it does not befit to break the limb again unnecessarily.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many proud doctors and restorers in our land who have done this.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is dangerous and harmful, leading to death, or great fear, as indeed it is mortal
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and nodosity are recent: then it is fitting to bathe it with warm water, in which decoctions of soothing herbs are boiled, such as elder leaves, and the radix of it, and meadowsweet, and those of a like nature.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be applied to him a plaster with a softening agent, like a dyachilon made in the centre.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let there be taken mucilage of the root of saffron, and let it be mixed with fat of a hen, or with beeswax: and let there be plastered with this
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let there be taken poppy seeds, and let them be pounded with columbine seed, and with such things as the physicians call to reduce consolidation
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the swelling has subsided with constant and gentle friction, as with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb must be administered to all parts at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however twisting has preceded it, and it has become strong, and has been converted to stone, and has become necessary to do something about it: then it is necessary to cut off above it, and to solve the continuation of the bone, and to remove what is superfluous from the swelling or from the bone with fine scissors: and to administer aid in that with solicitude and care
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	About the matter of dislocation
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it hinders its movement and deforms the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes the suffering of great pain, and wounds which are causing suffering
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore dislocation has happened to anyone, then it is necessary to hasten to restore it: neither must it be delayed at all
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place is becoming stiff, and perhaps with that the reduction of the dislocation becomes more difficult
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary to move, nor extend it in the hour of stiffness.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since many things cause spasm and painful sensations.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	When such a thing happens, then it is necessary that you perform phlebotomy on the patient at once.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	And let it be discharged until the swelling has subsided.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be bound with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	And it should be gradually reduced
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And care for the entire limb so that no pain remains in its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I command you to treat dislocations, even if they are caused by fractures, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of the body
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	As for the treatment of mandibular dislocation
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles rarely dislocate, except for a few times.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to two forces.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are forced out of their places by a slight displacement and are softened together.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, that is, right out of their place, until they are softened to the part of the chest, until the patient's saliva flows freely, and he is unable to close his mouth, and his tongue is swollen
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation is slight, it returns by itself with little force
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete, do this immediately: the physician should insert his thumb of his hand into the root of the mandible at the dislocation between the bones, if the dislocation is from one side only
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	If the dislocation is from two parts, do not insert two fingers into the wound simultaneously.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And let the remaining fingers of the hand be outside, so that they may equal
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	Command the patient to open his jaw wide and relax the teeth, and bring them together again
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	The physician must equal the jaw, and push the jaw, until it returns to its place
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are together: then give an evaporation with warm water and oil, until it is easy to reduce both of them: do not attempt to reduce both of them entirely as we have said
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they have returned and been equaled, and the bone of the patient is closed, and not softened: then put over the wound a pad of wool, with a coat of wax made from beeswax: and moisten with rose water.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	And bind with ease with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient rest on his back: and his head be stable between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right and left: neither be bound, nor forced to chew anything: for give him soft food to eat, until when he feels the pain has gone away, and the jaw has settled: then he may eat whatever he wants, and this with ease
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Do not worry over the operation of his mouth among eating and drinking, and biting, until the jaw has settled and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their place: then many times accidents occur from them in fever, and strong soda: and perhaps the patient will vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When the limb has been thus helped: then you know that it is lost, and that it will perish to him to whom it has happened in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Regarding the reduction of the dislocation of the Furcula (collarbone) and the extremity of the humerus (upper arm bone).
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The Furcula (collarbone) does not dislocate from the inside outwards, because of its continuity with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It dislocates sometimes outwards: and it is declared by sensation
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient should lie upon his back and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cover the place with your strong palm, for it will return by itself
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put upon it a bandage, and sponges, and bind it firmly
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities following the elbow do not dislocate with it, except rarely
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and equated as we have said, and that preparation be made for you
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put upon it a bandage, and sponges, and bind it firmly
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the same cure has reduced the extremity of the Humerus, when it is separated even from its place
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Regarding the reduction of the dislocation of the Humerus (upper arm bone).
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the Humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Whoever one of them is, so that he be dislocated to the lower part of the tibia.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Whoever one of them is, so that he be dislocated to the lower part of the tibia.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	Whoever one of them is, so that he be dislocated to the lower part of the tibia: and this is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	Whoever one of them is, so that he be dislocated to the lower part of the tibia, and not to the back, because of the sputum.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	Whoever one of them is, so that he be dislocated to the lower part of the tibia, and not to the front, because of the nerve
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Whoever one of them is, so that he be dislocated and go down to the lower part of the tibia: above all in those in whom the flesh is little
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Whoever one of them is, so that he be dislocated and go down to the lower part of the tibia: for they go out quickly and enter quickly
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, however, in whom the flesh is much, it is the contrary, namely that they go out with difficulty and enter with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And sometimes it happens to some men a blow or a fall, and the humerus is displaced with heat, and it is thought because of this that it is dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary therefore to experience this until you are certain about it, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	It is recognized as dislocation when it is towards the lower part of the tibia: and you must distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find among them a manifest difference, and you will find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the tibia at the touch of the head of the humerus as if it were a bone: and it is not possible for a healthy man to move his hand to his mouth, or to move it in any way
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Likewise, if the chest joint is dislocated upwards or downwards: then you find a palpable displacement, which is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And in such a dislocation, reduction is easily accomplished when the limb is still tense or if the patient is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And reduction of it is as though you lift the limb upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your fingers under the joint and lift the limb with force upwards to its place: and the minister will lift the limb and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place the lower part below, and he himself will quickly return downwards.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, it does not return by that which we have said, and if several days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary to bathe the patient in warm water, and to apply a bandage which softens and lubricates, like that which is used for the decoction of the radix of fennel, and mugwort, and mastic in water, and to administer these things
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient is placed lying on his back: and under the joint a sphere and bandage are placed which are equal between softness and tension
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor places his heel on the sphere and lifts the arm with force, and draws the limb downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister holds the head of the limb so that it does not move downwards: he himself will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if necessary, reduce it in this way: and it is that you make a person stand beside the patient who is longer than him, and stands on the side, and inserts his arm under the patient's joint: and lift the joint upwards until the patient is suspended in the air
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister takes the hand of the patient and lowers it to the lower parts of the belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the patient is flexible: then it is necessary to suspend it with something else, so that it does not return dislocated immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It is also reduced in another manner: that is, by fixing it to the ground with a long stick whose head is rounded like a mace: as with a surgeon's glove: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then one places under the patient after placing on the head of the stick a soft cloth: and the patient is fixed according to the length of the stick.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then extend his hand downwards from the other side, and extend his body from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have said, then take hold of a stick whose length is equal to the length of two arms, and whose width is equal to the length of four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to the length of two fingers: whose head is rounded, so that it may alleviate the entrance into the rectum, according to this form
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then bind over the rounded head a soft cloth, so that it does not hurt the patient's hand
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place under the rectum of the patient so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick to the lower parts: and bind the stick over the support and the arm and the extremity of the hand
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the step of the ladder by the width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang loose from the other side
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint returns immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When the opening has been completed according to whatever method is possible: then it is necessary to place under the titulus a sphere of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared dressing made from ground barley with ointment and white of egg over the whole arm, as is customary above
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the titulus a proper bandage: and twist the ligament over the dressing above: and bind the hand to its collar: and leave it, without moving the hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to give the patient a nourishing diet, until the limb is comfortable: for it is faster for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then place a larger one after seven days, or five: and take it away when it moves.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is firm and does not soften, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the ligature is often dislocated, because of moisture which has happened to it, or for some other cause: then it is necessary to apply in it a cautery with three holes, according to what is prescribed in the chapter on cautery
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If you do all this, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the ligature is not confirmed: and the dressing and the bandage are reduced above it somewhat, and it does not harden, and falls away, and does not rise again: then you know that the nerves that are at the head of the humerus are cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the ligature will never be fixed in its place
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The dislocation which happens towards the breast and the nipple, or at the back: is done with impulse and extension with the hands: until it returns, and a further bandage and care are administered until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing the greatness has increased in a limb, and there is tardiness in its motion, then the patient is to be bathed with hot water until the greatness has been softened, and has returned to its first state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Concerning the cure of dislocation of the cubit
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the dislocation of the cubit is difficult, and returns with difficulty: and that it is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	Its dislocation is not concealed: because it hangs down under the skin, and under the touch, according to whatever figure it is dislocated
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated cubit with the healthy one, it is declared that it is manifest
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint must be bound together, and must not be doubled over, nor touched with the other arm
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to reduce the dislocation promptly, before a cold abscess forms on it
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a cold abscess forms on it, its reduction becomes difficult: and it is often not healed at all, especially when it is at the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For every kind of dislocation is worse, and especially painful: and it descends a great deal with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce it, is that you extend your hand with two hands: and the arm is expanded, and the hands of the physician are above the cubit and under it, and he himself urges the joining together with the thumbs of both hands, or with the root of the palm of his hand, until it returns to its place
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or else the dislocation is to the front: then it returns so that you double your hand with your hand, until it touches with the root of the palm of your hand the cubit which is dislocated
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If it does not obey by dislocation for reduction, then administer extension forcefully: and let two ministers extend the arm; and let them hold it fast, so that it does not slip from the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Once the arm has been repositioned to its proper place, let the long or broad ligament be doubled over the hand again
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	When the physician grasps the hand with his grasp, let him anoint it with oil: so that it will be slippery and facilitate the joint
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then push the joint forcefully until it returns
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after reduction, it is necessary to place upon it a dressing that has stypticity and exudes moisture with alum: and bind the bandage tightly.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	Let the arm be suspended from the neck of the sufferer: and keep it quiet for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it will be healed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the joint is firmly closed in its place, then solve the ligament from that and let it go
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	If you see that the joint has not been properly bound, then apply the dressing once more, and the ligament and let it go for a few days until it is bound
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then it will be healed
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, there is still pain after reduction of the joint, and the limb remains immobile: then administer lubrication in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the limb is firm, or place upon the joint a cushion of wool, that is, the fleece of a sheep's tail
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	And bind it, and let it rest day and night
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take away the dressing, and put it into the bath
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When the wound is oozing, then the oil should be rubbed in gently with a tempering of friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply a little oil once more, and a second time, and a third time with the water inside the bath, until it is softened.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon the wound a soft cushion of cotton, moistened, warmed with butter, and bind over it.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this often.</start_of_turn>
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	The wound itself will soften, and will return to its natural state.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ On the treatment of dislocations.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn>
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	When the hand is severely dislocated, that is, an injury between the arm and the hand.</start_of_turn
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.</start_of_turn
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Indeed, it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of the dislocation in the hour when it is dislocated, before it is solidified: or else it will happen that in that solidifying it will be hardened.</start_of_turn
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is like this: place the lower hand of Mahassem upon a board, and extend the arm: and the physician puts his palm upon the prominence of the dislocation and urges it, until it returns.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Indeed, it is necessary to consider, if the palm has receded towards the wrist: then the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board alongside the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be inside the board, that is, let the inner part of the hand be placed upon the board, so that the physician’s palm can rest upon the prominence of the dislocation.</start_of_turn
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If he returns immediately, it is good: but if not, tighten the ligature with the paste still soft and let it go, and do not revisit it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he does not tolerate it, neither can you force a reduction: after a few days have passed, the knot will remain firm according to its hardness: and it does no harm to the patient, except that you must soften the hand, for nothing can be tied. Then you know that the nerve has been severed or injured.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no wisdom in that, except to tighten it close to the case with a cautery
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	It may even do no good.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When the Almahassem does not return, then put upon it the paste we mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then tighten it and let it go after five days: afterwards it is to be dissolved and let go, and the hand is to be exercised
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its motion is deprived, and something weighty has occurred in it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction until it softens.

Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the Digit has been dislocated from its place to all parts, or from the palm of the hand to the dorsum of the hand, or towards the belly: then extend the Digit and drive out the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the Digit, and suspend it over the part from which it is dislocated, and let it go in two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it until it is straight in that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When the night is dark, bind up the limb according to its own narration: and do not cease resolving it until the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it up at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do it during the day a little at a time, until it is bound up.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with the hand if it is dislocated to the bone: and bind it up to its own part, and do the operation as before until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When anyone has suffered dislocation of the spine, either complete or partial, or has displaced many spinal vertebrae from their places: then there is no remedy for it, for the moisture is proper for the sickly person.</start_of_turn
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sickly person is ejected without his will, and cannot hold himself: and many times he softens some part of his body, or two limbs, or two arms, or one of them: or displaces a spinal vertebra from its place.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times he displaces them, because many times they are separated into four parts.</start_of_turn
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is displaced to the back is called Gibbositas.</start_of_turn
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment for this is that they should be rejoined immediately, if the Gibbositas has happened from infancy: then there is no remedy for it, and no healing from it at all.</start_of_turn
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	And in whatever case it has happened by blow or like this, as the ancients have said in a long discourse about the methods of treatment.</start_of_turn

Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginning
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle board over the Spondilem.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And place their feet on the other extremity of the physician
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And bind securely, until the Spondilem is firm, and return to its place.</start_of_turn>
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if desired, work with the ankle which is involved with your hand: and it is that you take two boards as long as the forearm on one side and two boards at the head of it on the other side.</start_of_turn>
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length which is between every two boards is the palm of one hand: and when it is made in every place there is a hole in which the ankle runs: and fix every board firmly to the ground so that it does not move at all.</start_of_turn
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert the round bar: and it is the ankle in which the ligament is twisted in two holes of the two boards.</start_of_turn
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole in which the board is fixed, whose length is the palm with that which is twisted: and in two other boards it is like that.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then bind the ligaments which you have bound in the chest of the patient with the ankle which is at his head: and the ligaments which you have bound in the thighs with the ankle which is at his feet.</start_of_turn
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stay at every ankle minister, who twists his hand with a ruler, with which the ankle is twisted: and the physician equalizes the Spondilem, as we said.</start_of_turn
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the ankle.</start_of_turn
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then when the Spondilem returns and the place is equal, then it is necessary that you put on a dressing of dried eggs with albumin or oil.</start_of_turn
Deinde stuppam.	Then apply the [stuppam].
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then apply the [stuppam] above the plaster cast, the width of which is three fingers, or about as wide as the thumb.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be as much as will cover the area of the elbow, and over the sound part of the Spondylus
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligament we mentioned before.</start_of_turn>
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be nourished with light food until he is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains prominent in the place at the end of the healing process: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, along with the plaster which we mentioned for a long period.</start_of_turn
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And they are administered on that layer of lead.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when it happens that prominence appears at the end of the spine: and it is thought to be due to dislocation, and that is the bone which is now prominent.</start_of_turn
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is necessary that an assumption be made for it with these medicines: perhaps it will prevent death from occurring.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.</start_of_turn
Caput XXXII.	Chapter II.</start_of_turn
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the dislocations of the ankle and the humerus do not happen except in cases of dislocation only: neither do they happen except for the removal of a small piece and a concavity.</start_of_turn
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the ankle is divided into four parts.</start_of_turn
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.</start_of_turn
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	The majority are displaced inwards: slightly displaced forwards, and to the rear.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment of such dislocation is inwards: for when you join the limb of the sick with that of the healthy, the latter is longer: and the knee of the sick is more prominent than that of the healthy, and the sick cannot double his foot over the ankle: and the place which follows the ankle is that which follows the heel which is hot, because the head of the coxae is already there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign of it is that the dislocation is outwards, because its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of it is that it expands the healthy limb along the thigh: however, it does not double itself without pain at the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot do so without support: and he retains his urine, and his ankle is swollen, and there is swelling at his walking.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of it is that it does not expand the knee, nor can he double it before he has doubled his ankle: and his limb is also shorter than the other: and his ankle is soft, and the head of the coxae is at the hip bone place
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is of various kinds, as when it is an old dislocation which has become habituated with the limb having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you perform the reduction and it remains as before: there is no healing in that treatment at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	It is not right therefore that suspicion should be cast upon him
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In the case of that in which the dislocation is fixed, and is of four kinds of dislocation: then it is proper for you to join them together, and extend the limb inwards and outwards, and move it from side to side: perhaps then it will return, and no other treatment will be necessary.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare the minister strong and extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands or with a ligature which is tied above his knee: and another minister extends his hand above, so that he inserts his hand under his toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tighten with a ligature of soft material over the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the hip bone, or from the posterior part to the part of the back
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension be whole, until the patient is lifted with his body from the earth, and remains hanging
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is a common kind of extension of the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, it returns loose with that which we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary in every kind that which we shall speak of concerning the proper treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction, however, of its own when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the patient be laid over on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place the ligament over the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh and the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the hip bone
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another minister takes a strong arm and grasps the thick part of the lower thigh, and extends it outwards with the extension which has just been made
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And thus it returns to its place
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the rest of the methods for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, he excuses himself from thee, and does not obey thy order to enter with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary that two feet of the patient be bound together with a strong, soft ligament, over two calcanei, and over two knees: and that the length of each be equal to four fingers; and that the limb which is diseased be extended more than the other by two fingers' breadth.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	The diseased limb is then suspended above the head of the ligament which is in the house: and its length from the ground be equal to the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong youth to hold the thigh: and suspend it with the diseased limb: and let the youth pull the limb with force, keeping the thigh fixed with force; for the ligature returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the patient lie upon a board, as we have mentioned in the case of gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament over the limb itself, over the groin and over the breastbone.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two boards are placed, one at the feet and the other at the head of the limb.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	And a board is placed in the middle of the foot, fixed well: over which are placed wet cloths, so that it does not irritate the patient: and let the board be between the thighs, so that it does not pull towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then extend all the limbs towards their parts, and the physician equalizes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys the reversion, it is good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place upon the limb itself a board, and press upon it, as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	The patient must be placed upon his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	When the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary to extend the limb quickly: this is in accordance with the former narration concerning the podium: and the physician places his right hand on the knee of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he grasps the limb with the other hand, and when he has grasped it, he extends the limb downwards to the knee
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	If the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary to extend the limb downwards, but rather to elevate it above the ground: rather, it is necessary to place it upon a firm support, as it is done even if the dislocation is wide outwards, as we said concerning its recumbent position over two cushions: and this is upon its face and extended ligaments: as we said just now
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	It is necessary to apply a compression bandage with a board also over the place from which the fracture has been displaced, when the reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden: and it is that you extend both limbs of the patient: and when you remove these equal, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without pain: then you know that the limb has returned, as it should be: then you must join the two thighs together, and put on a dressing, and bind with a bandage, that is, with a twist: so that it does not move outwards to any part: and the patient must rest quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then heal the ligament, and the dressing, and compare the limb with the other: then if you find them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation has been stabilized: absolutely so that the patient can walk again.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	If you see any softening: then renew the reduction, and put on the dressing again, and bind it as before: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Then heal it and make its walking slow above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable.
Caput XXXIII.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking above either side for a few days, until it is comfortable
Deinde solue ea.	Then resolve them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	Then resolve them. And do not allow the patient to walk for a few days until they are healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, the reduction recurs, then administer strengthening of the limb with ligaments, as was mentioned previously in the treatment of an ankle, until it returns.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the calcaneus.</start_of_turn
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.</start_of_turn>
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus sometimes requires only slight displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its complement.</start_of_turn
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is either inward or outward.</start_of_turn
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that the heel is swollen, proceeding to the part from which it is dislocated.</start_of_turn
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for its displacement is easy: to extend it gently with the hands, and to restore it, until it returns.</start_of_turn
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of the latter, when it is dislocated according to its complement, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright: and hold the limb firmly with a strong hand from the back of the ankle, in the middle of it.</start_of_turn
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then take your right hand and grasp the foot from above, and with your left hand from below the foot at the ankle bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And with the left hand support the ankle bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left hand, and push the ankle bone with the right hand without straining.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do it twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the heel of the foot towards the knee in the third space, and you draw out the nail.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it comes back into the space once, or twice in this way, and you equalize the foot, that is good: and if not, you do the operation again above that: for it will come back itself
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, it is forbidden to reduce it with that which we have said: then make the patient lie upon his back upon the earth, and fix the heel of the limb firmly in the ground, so that it lies between the patient's thighs: and you will have involved the limb above that, so that it does not hurt the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then take hold of the knee of the limb: afterwards extend the limb with your hand or with the ligament which is over the knee of the limb.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then extend all the limbs against the extension of their companion: and the heel will be stable between the thighs of the patient, holding it so that it does not draw the body downwards towards the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor will equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other minister will hold the sound limb downwards
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation will return with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When it has returned, and it is declared that the limb is sound concerning its reduction: then put on a plaster and a bandage, and bind up the limb securely with ligaments, and bind the foot with the ligament to the knee
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to beware of nerves, which are above the heel behind, so that there is no tension on the ligaments over them, and that it does not hurt them
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let it go in two or three days
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, string it up: then dissolve it on the third or fourth day. And restrain the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he nevertheless tries to walk before that space has healed, no security will result, for the dislocation will not be dissolved, but will be corrupted, and will not receive any treatment after that
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If there should happen to him a hard swelling: then it is necessary, that you manage in the sedation of that, in which the story proceeded before in another place from the cure, and the embrocation, until it be removed
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	About the dislocation of the fingers of the foot, and their care.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary, that the dislocation be equal with the limb when the tension is slight without pain: and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some part of the ankle of the foot: then it is necessary, that the patient should sit down the foot on the same level as the earth, or on a board: and he should be still as when he is walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you should stay, and place your foot on that which comes out from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then bandage it with your foot with oil, until it returns, and when it has returned it will be equal, and will not appear in a prominent place
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the foot of him a board which will hold the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then string it up with a tight bandage for three days
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then dissolve it, and keep him quiet from walking for many days, until it is strung and secured from reduction
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When anything of this kind happens, and you know its cure and restoration, many things often follow: and because of this it is not right to be arrogant about its cure, which is like this, except for one who is prudent in the art of long healing, merciful, compassionate, tardy, not audacious, and not arrogant: and as it is accustomed in the beginning of medical practice to put cold compresses upon the patient's wounds. And let him be discharged from the physician's judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Except that you think, or hope for salvation from the peril with the gentleness of the ailment, and in which something appears of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the case, before a cold swelling occurs
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the limb has returned, as we wish, then manage the wound as is appropriate for it with the unguents of desiccation.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with fracture, and the bones are separated in the sockets, then try to break them apart, and do in this what we said in the ailments of the simple fractures in those places
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be cautious according to your virtue, and protect yourself from the entrance of fear: as I have foretold you before
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For it is better for you before the Creator of yours, and more lasting for your glory, and more healing for your body in your time.
