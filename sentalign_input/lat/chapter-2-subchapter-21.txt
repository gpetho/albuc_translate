On the incision of the uveal layer.
Chapter 21.
When a rupture occurs in the uveal layer, then it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance because of it, and if you wish to cut it: the procedure is as follows, as I describe: insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle with a double thread on the side of the lacrimal gland, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle in its place.
Next, cut at the spot of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle: and tighten it firmly.
Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye: and leave it, until the thread falls off with the uvea.
Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it, until the wound heals.
And sometimes the uvea is compressed all around with a cloth band, until the eye gains a large prominence.
Then it should be pierced with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, allowing the whitish fluid to flow, and the eye will lower and immediately return inside: then compress it, until it heals.
