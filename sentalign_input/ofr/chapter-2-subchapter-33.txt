When the teeth become loose
When the front teeth become loose, either by being struck or by falling, and the patient cannot chew what they eat without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and it is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold wire, because silver wire turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and the wire should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth;
and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the wire and put it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, whether there is one or more, until you come carefully to the healthy tooth on the other side;
then repeat the wrapping up to the part where you began, and tighten it carefully and skillfully with your hand, so that it does not move;
and the ligature should be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pliers, and bring them together, and fold them back between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not hurt the tongue;
and then leave it tightened as much as possible, and if it comes loose, or the wire breaks, tighten it with another wire;
it will remain and serve thus for its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the illustration of the straightening of the two healthy teeth and the two loose ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, fresh by fresh, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and experienced, and sometimes one makes the shape of a tooth from cow bone, and puts it in the place where the defect is, and tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
