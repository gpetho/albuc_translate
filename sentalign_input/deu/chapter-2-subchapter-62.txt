Chapter 62.
On the section about watery hernia.
Watery hernia is merely an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which is under the covering of the genitals containing the testicle, and it is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane that nature prepared in the testicle area, making it appear as though there is another testicle; and it is the genital covering between the white sac we mentioned, and it is merely solid matter.
The generation of this hernia is due to weakness occurring in the genitals, causing this material to accumulate there, and sometimes it occurs from a blow to the genitals.
This moisture has many colors, either yellowish, blood-like, red, black and foul, or watery white, which is the most common.
The signs by which this accumulation of water is known are these: if it is in the white sac, the swelling is round, slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and the genitals appear so because the moisture surrounds it entirely.
If the moisture is in the membrane itself, the swelling is round with part of the testicle, and thus it is thought to be another testicle.
If the moisture is between the genital covering and the white sac, it falls below the perception.
When you want to determine the color of the moisture, you test the color of the moisture in the swelling with a square probe; and based on what comes out in the mark from the probe, you judge what is inside.
When we come to treating it with surgery, we should instruct the patient to be bled if possible, and cleanse his body fully.
Then let him lie on his back on a slightly elevated surface, and place many cloths under him.
Sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to be on his right side, who will extend his penis to one of two sides to the covering of the genitals and the lower part of the abdomen.
Then take a broad knife and cut the genital covering in the middle along its length down to near the pubic bone.
The incision should be made straight and equally distant from the line dividing the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white sac.
Expose it, and be careful not to cut it; your exposure of it should be done delicately, suspending the testicle more and carefully inspecting it according to the amount possible.
Then perforate the water-filled sac with a wide opening and extract all the water.
Separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sac to the upper parts; do not touch the covering of the genitals, and cut the sac as much as possible.
Cut it entirely or in pieces, especially its delicate side, because if you do not carefully cut it, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the testicle comes out of its covering during your operation, once you have completed the incision of the sac, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the genital covering with sutures, and treat it like any other wound until it heals.
If you find the testicle is corrupted by another disease, you must tie the vessels on the suspensory cord, remove the testicle, and treat it as previously mentioned.
If the water is accumulated in two separate parts, know that there are two hernias; make the incision in that part as you did in the other; if it appears to be a single operation, then do it.
Then cleanse the blood, and place wool soaked in oil or rose oil in the incisions; place other wool soaked in wine and oil outside, spread it over the two genitals and the lower abdomen; place folded cloths and powders on top, and bind them with a bandage in this manner:
Take two cloths and fill them with carded wool as follows; make ends of cotton or damp wool, attach them with a structure in the breech of the trousers, one end from the bottom to the back, the second end to the lower part of the abdomen, two ends over the thighs below, and two other ends over the groins, and adjust the whole structure in the breech of the trousers.
Sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of surgical cutting; take a subtle knife-like cautery and incise the covering of the genitals, ignite it as we have described until the white sac containing the water is exposed, then take the cautery in this shape:
It is shaped like a Greek letter.
Then pierce the sac with it, ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
Extend the sac with hooks, and expose it with hooks, and expose it with a subtle ignited cautery; cut it as much as possible until you eradicate everything; take care not to let the fire touch the testicle.
Know that this operation is safer and less prone to blood flow, and better than surgery with cutting.
But if a hot swelling opposes you during the cutting or cautery operation, or if there is a flow of blood, you must treat the opposition accordingly, with the treatment appropriate for it as mentioned.
But if the patient is fearful and does not endure the second operation due to its horror, administer a perforation as I describe here; this is when it is confirmed by you, from what we have said about the signs, that this hernia is watery.
Then have the patient sit on an elevated seat, pierce the swelling at its lowest part with a broad knife, and make the perforation along the length of the body.
The opening should be wide enough to drain all the water.
Then place cotton over the area, bind it, and leave it, so that the remaining water drains.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the drainage of the water when you pierce it, this is because the white membrane in the wound opening opposes and prevents the exit of the water, you must insert a plug or instrument used to extract water from dropsy, as previously described; or adjust a small instrument in the wound opening.
Know that the water returns, and it is accumulated around six months or thereabouts; when it is accumulated, pierce it in the same manner, as the patient will thus live out his days.
