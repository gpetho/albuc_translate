On the method of cauterizing in the fissures of the lips.
Chapter 20.
Frequently, fissures called “Pili” occur on the lip, especially on children’s lips.
When you treat these fissures using what we discussed in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery to this form.
Its concavity should match the thinness of a knife.
Then quickly apply it, heated, to the fissures themselves until the cautery reaches the depths of the fissures.
Then treat it with wax ointment until it heals.
