On the extraction of arrows.
Chapter 96.
Arrows vary according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge.
Their diversity is as follows: for among them are those that have large and small points, and those that are concave and deaf.
And among them are those that have three edges.
And among them are those with tongues.
And among them are those with stars.
Those that lodge in certain parts of the body fall into two categories.
Either they are in the principal hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar parts.
Therefore, when it lodges in any of these parts, and signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you later, you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows in most cases.
And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the part, then extract it and treat the wound.
Among the signs of the brain when an arrow lodges there, and it penetrates the bone, and the membrane over the brain emerges, are these: sudden seizures, dizziness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, mental confusion, and vomiting of bile.
And sometimes blood comes out from the nose or ears.
And sometimes speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture similar to porridge comes out of the wound site.
And something similar to the watery discharge of flesh exits from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow when it lodges in the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and it feels as if it is fixed in a hard object, not in an empty one.
And sometimes the movement of the arrow resembles the beat of a pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.
And coldness of the extremities follows, along with cold sweat and fainting.
Know, therefore, that death approaches without a doubt.
The sign of an arrow wounding the lung is foamy blood coming from the wound, and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the patient's color changes.
And he breathes a deep, high breath, and seeks the attraction of cold air.
But if the arrow lodges in the membrane in the chest, then it is near the small ribs, and there is great shortness of breath with intense pain, with sighing, and all the muscles of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow lodges in the stomach, then perhaps something undigested exits from the wound.
And if the arrow lodges in the abdomen and sticks there, something of feces exits from the wound, or bile, or intestine that is already ruptured.
Therefore, there is no hope in curing it, nor in extracting the arrow.
But if the arrow lodges in the bladder and urine comes out, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the afflicted, then know that it is fatal.
However, the remaining parts, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, auxiliary part, spinal vertebrae, clavicle, hip, leg, and similar parts of the body are preserved in most cases, as long as the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve and is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have observed concerning these arrows, so that you may apply it in your practice.
For instance, an arrow fell into a man’s tear duct at the root of his nose.
I therefore extracted it for him from the other side, under the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow for a Jew, which had lodged in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden, and I only managed to reach a small part of it, where it was fixed in its wooden shaft, and it was a large arrow from the Turkish bows, with a smooth iron head, without barbs.
Thus the Jew was healed, and no bad incident occurred to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, one that has barbs.
I therefore made an incision over it between the two guidegi, for it was already embedded in his throat.
So I proceeded delicately with it until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had fallen into his abdomen, and we thought he would die from it.
But after thirty days had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow, maneuvered skillfully, extracted it, and he was healed, with no bad incident occurring.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had healed over it.
Then, seven years later, the arrow emerged at the base of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her, yet none of her bodily functions were affected, and she experienced no harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man into whose face an arrow had fallen; the wound healed, and it remained without causing him much pain, and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man among the King’s nobles, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and had shifted slightly to the right; the entire arrow was concealed.
Thus I was called to treat him three days after the arrow had fallen.
I found the arrow wound very tight.
I therefore probed it with a thin probe, and did not feel it, but he did feel a prick and pain under his right ear.
I then suspected that this prick was from the arrow’s tip.
So I applied a plaster to the area with attracting and digesting properties, confident that the area would become inflamed, and the sign of the arrow would appear for me to cut over it; yet no indication showed that the arrow had reached that spot.
So I continued applying the plaster over him for many days; no incident occurred, and the wound healed in the meantime, and he remained untroubled by the extraction for a period of days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
And he told me about it.
I then applied a sharp, corrosive medicine over the wound for many days until it opened, and I probed it and felt the thin tip of the arrow where it adhered to the wood.
Then I continued to open the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to us, and approximately four months passed with him.
Then, after the wound had widened enough, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, though it did not yield to extraction, I did not stop refining and devising methods over it until one day I started on it with forceps properly made, as their form will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Nevertheless, I restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered fully, with no harm done to him at all.
And I tell you the manner of extracting certain arrows so that you may use it as a rule and guide over what I have not described.
For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not fully conveyed in narration, nor does a book cover it all, and a skilled craftsman compares the small over the large, and what is present over what is absent, and finds a new procedure and new instrument in the context of extraordinary occurrences in this art when they happen.
Therefore, I say that arrows do not exit from the parts in which they are fixed except in two ways.
Either by drawing it out from the place where it entered.
Or through the opposite side.
And the one that exits from where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in a fleshy area, can be drawn out and extracted.
But if it does not yield to exit at the time it falls, then you should leave it for a few days, until the flesh around it begins to decompose, and the extraction and removal become easier.
Similarly, if it is lodged in the bone and does not yield to you for removal, then leave it also for a few days, and try again each day with traction and movement until it exits.
But if it still does not yield to exit after days, then you must drill around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine drill, until the area for the arrow is widened.
Then pull it and extract it.
If, however, the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already entered one of the brain’s ventricles, and some of the symptoms I mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it, until the condition stabilizes after some days.
For if the arrow reaches the membrane (sifach), then death is not delayed for him.
But if the arrow is only fixed in the bone itself, and does not penetrate to the membrane, and the patient remains stable for some days without any of those symptoms occurring, then proceed with ingenuity in pulling and extracting the arrow.
If it is firmly fixed and does not yield to traction, then use drills around the arrow as I told you, and then treat the area until it heals.
If the arrow is already hidden in a part of the body and is concealed and out of reach, then locate it with a probe.
If you feel it, then pull it with certain instruments suitable for its extraction.
If you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and if there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then make an incision over it, widening the wound until it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
If it has barbs to hold it, then free the flesh lodged in them on all sides with every skill you can manage, and proceed carefully if the flesh cannot yield to the breaking of the barbs or their twisting, until it is freed.
And when you are performing the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until you make it emerge, handling it with the utmost delicacy so that the arrow does not break, making its extraction more difficult for you.
If you cannot manage it in one attempt, then leave it for several days, until the surrounding tissues begin to decay.
Then try again, as it will be easier. If, however, bleeding hinders you, then administer the treatment I mentioned in its chapter, and take care to avoid cutting any vein, nerve, or tendon.
And use every skill you can in freeing the arrow, with ease, calm, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, the patient is positioned as he was at the moment the arrow struck him.
For it is more beneficial.
But if that is not possible, then use whatever positions are available to you.
Now, for an arrow that exits through the opposite side, either part of it is already protruding externally, or its tip creates a bulge felt under the nearby surface of the skin, and you see it protruding; make an incision over it large enough to accommodate the forceps.
Then pull it, for it will be easy to remove.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is set in the bone and enlarges itself: then pull it out.
And if not: leave it for a few days, then try again until it comes out.
But if the shaft of the arrow is within it, then push it with it.
But if the shaft has fallen, and you wish to apply pressure, then insert into it a hollow instrument so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow: then push it with it.
But if the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters it.
For the arrow is eased by that.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if that is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow has fallen into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is near enough that you can touch it with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then suture the wound if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps by which arrows are extracted.
Let the tips be like a bird’s beak, which are made like iron: when they grip the arrow, they do not let go.
And many types are made from them, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its slenderness, the breadth of the wound, and its narrowness.
The shape of the hollow pusher.
And the shape of the blunt pusher.
This is of a blunt end like a spoke, so that its entry into the hollow arrow is eased and it is pushed with it.
The tip of this hollow pusher is hollow like a bird's feather, so that the entry of the arrow into it is eased, as is its pushing.
