Sometimes an abscess arises in a fleshy place, and remains so long that it creates a large collection of pus;
and then it breaks and bursts, and the pus spurts out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel;
and the skin that is over it is as thin as a delicate cloth, and it does not run down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such a condition is called a "sinus," and it is not called a "fistula";
but if it is so elongated that it reaches down to the bone deeply, it is called a "fistula";
and the treatment is that you cut this skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a cloth;
and it will not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with an enema like this:
observe if the breast is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then administer an Egyptian medicine enema which is made like this:
take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, in equal parts, and put them to cook in a vessel over fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take some of this according to your need, and mix it with water and honey, and inject it into the breast with an enema, and constrict the opening;
and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then extract it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the breast is cleansed, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is cleansed with ash water, when this medicine is not available, and you should take ashes from vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and inject it with an enema, until you know that the breast is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then cleanse it with water and honey in which a little litharge has been ground;
or you cleanse it with mixed honey and wine, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine helps dry the breast;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the breast is well cleansed, then cleanse it with that which generates flesh in it, and you should take diachylon plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you cleanse it with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the breast is small, and the tube of the syringe cannot enter, then widen it a little with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of the Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then sew it up and leave only one place where the syringe can enter, and if the opening that drains pus is at the top, make it in the lowest place.
For when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to regenerate;
and if you cannot cut the breast from below as you wish, then arrange it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to regenerate, and if you cannot cut the breast from below as you wish, arrange it in this way:
so that the pus flows easily downwards, and do not leave any of the pus there;
and take consolidative medicines to put on the breast, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers the entire breast;
then cut forcefully around the opening of the breast a little larger than the first, then spread a soothing ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the breast to draw out the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once;
and the one that is over the opening of the breast, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take care if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this way and you see the nature that jumps/pushes on the opening of the breast, then know that the breast is healing, and health is approaching; 
and then unbind it in the morning, or the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if the breast releases undigested pus after many days, know that the breast will not heal.
And if thin venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for health is approaching.
For there are people whose flesh is slow to regenerate in their wounds, and others who do the opposite; 
and if undigested pus comes out of the breast after many days, know that the breast will not heal;
and if the breast is slow to heal, and it is prolonged, add medicines that are moist in substance and dry in virtue, like diachylon ointment, for it contains a large amount of vitriol, and that is the last medicine;
take diachylon ointment, and make it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equal in substance;
then preserve it and use it;
and this same thing does better cooked thickened, when diachylon ointment is not available, or you take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire;
and then spread it on a cloth, and spread it over the breast, and sometimes administer long birthwort, and roots of celestial lily, which is like vetch flour and centaury;
and use it simple or compound:
grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey I mentioned, and use it;
and if the treatment is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard members, or on the ligaments;
then treat it for a fistula, as we have said before.
