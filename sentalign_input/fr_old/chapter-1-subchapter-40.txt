of the hip
When viscous moisture descends to the hip joint, causing it to dislocate, and the sign is that one thigh is longer than the other when measured together; and the location of the dislocation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip joint with a circular cautery, and bleed in front of the location around the joint so that the joint is within the circle; and let the cautery be like the one used for the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cautery be as deep as the entire core; and treat it until it is healed.
