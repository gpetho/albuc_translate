Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I completed this book for you, Sons [of], which is the last one in the science of medicine with its completion, and after I reached the end in it, through its explanations and its declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with hands.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with hands is laid low in our region and during our time, it has been entirely absent: perhaps the science of it has perished, and its trace has been lost: and nothing remains from it except small descriptions in old books, which have been changed by hand; and error and hesitation occurred until its intentions were closed off, and the force of it was weakened: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way of its explanation, and its abbreviation; and that I should provide with the forms of the instruments of Cautery, and the rest of the tools of work: when done by adding to its declarations, and through the necessity of it.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why no good craftsman with his hands can be found in this time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy which Galen narrated, so that he knows the aid of limbs, and their shapes, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, and their exits, and the arteries pulsating and quiet ones, and their locations.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason, Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already spoken about him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since he who is not knowing what we have said about anatomy, cannot avoid falling into error, in which people are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 I have seen a foolish surgeon cut out a scrofulous apostema on a woman's neck and cut some arteries in the neck: consequently the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I have seen another surgeon who presumptuously attempted to extract a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he came to him, and extracted it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I was already called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I have seen another surgeon who was receiving straw from some Duke of our land on account of medicine; and a black eunuch was with him, who was with him, and he sustained a fracture in his leg near the heel; and the surgeon rushed with his ignorance, and bound up the fracture over the wound with pulleys, and strong bindings, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he cured him according to his own neglect.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Later he sent him away for some days and ordered him not to loosen the binding; and he remained so until an apostema formed on his leg, and his own foot, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 Therefore I was called to him; and I hastened to loosen the binding; and peace came, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 The corruption was already confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Stop, the corruption has ceased to roam through the member until it has perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 I saw another doctor who pierced a malignant apostema; and after days, the ulceration was until the evil of it with its lord was manifested.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when it is a pure cancer from black bile, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can endure, so that the whole of it may be removed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of this, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation with salvation associated; and the operation with danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already aroused myself in every place of this book, where the operation comes, in which there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to be careful of that, and separate it yourself: so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and to disgrace.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Receive then the measure with care and protection, and take care of your weak ones with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading to grace of God to health and praiseworthy success: and dismiss terrible sicknesses that are difficult to heal; and remove from you what makes you afraid, so that hesitation in faith and your comfort may enter upon you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to the measures of yours.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galenus has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat the evil sickness; lest you be called an evil doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On cautery with fire, and cautery with sharp medicine, is the subject of this chapter, arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments, and tools for cautery, and all that is necessary in an operation. (paragraph break)
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On section and perforation, phlebotomy and blistering, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and similar items; and the entire subject is arranged according to the forms of instruments. (paragraph break)
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of twisting, and similar items; arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory. (in Latin: Soli Deo Gloria)
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part one.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 (paragraph break) On the benefits and harm of cautery; under which constitutions it is suitable, and at what time; and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter one.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 However, before I speak of the operation with it, it is first necessary to say the nature of its benefits and harm; and under which constitution it should be administered.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore, the discourse on the nature of the benefit and harm of cautery is lengthy, subtle, full of knowledge, and secret wisdom.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 And many wise men have spoken of it and disagreed on it; and I myself find enough from their discussions, fearing lengthiness.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore, cautery applies generally to all constitutions, whether with matter or without; except for two constitutions, which are a hot constitution without matter and a dry constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 However, in a hot and dry constitution with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some have said that Cautery is beneficial for it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite, namely that Cautery is not suitable for the disease which is due to heat and dryness, because nature of fire is heat: it is inappropriate to heal from a hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he said who says the opposite, that by Cautery is beneficial in every hot and dry disease which happens in human bodies, because when you compare a man's body and his humors, to the composition of fire, you find a man's body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say by his words: because it has been proved to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not necessary for him to come upon that, unless he who has already been proven and trained in the last chapter on Cautery, and knows the differences of men's complexions, and the dispositions of diseases within themselves, and their causes, and the characteristics of them, and the duration of their time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 As for other complexions, there is no fear over you: and especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 Indeed, all doctors agree on these: and they have not disagreed on the benefit with Cautery for them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know sons (pupils), that by secret healing with Cautery and fire, and the goodness of it on Cautery with medicine burning, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another joint connected with it, unless by a slight damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine reaches to that which is extended from the members: and perhaps it may cause difficult healing in the member, and perhaps it may kill.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, on account of its subtlety and goodness, does not act except when in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 It has become known to us through experiment, due to the length of servitude and study with art, and due to its position concerning truth: and because of that I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not prohibited to this book of mine, I would disclose to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies from which it expels sicknesses, demonstrated by philosophical discourse that would be comprehensible to your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, sons, that they themselves differ concerning the time when a cautery is to be made and consider a better time as truth permits.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is suitable at all times: for this reason, the harm resulting from time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if a cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong, urgent ones that do not tolerate delay: for this reason it is feared that from them may occur a malice that is greater than the little harm that passes through because of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And may that not enter your minds, sons, the idea that is not held except by the common people and foolish physicians, that to an illness cured by cautery there is always a return: and they put it as a consequence, but things are not as they think: for this reason cauterization is not, unless in place of medicine which changes the humor and removes humidities which are the causes of the pain.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 Nevertheless, a cautery is superfluous over medicine due to the speed of its health, and the virtue of its operation, and the violence of its dominion: and it is possible that illness may return at some hour of time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and the power of his illness: and that in the body it arises from an accumulation of superfluities in it: and that it reaches him in its acquisition from foods and similar things as causes, unless illness occurs for which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 Subtle sickness in a member of few superfluities and moistures, as cautery for a tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible that the pain will not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 That happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the common saying that cautery is the last medicine is correct in its literal meaning; not in reference to what they intend by it, because they believe that there is no cure given with medication, nor with anything after the fall of the cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But the fact is just the opposite, and their intention that cautery is the last medicine, is not so, except when we administer modes of cure in some sicknesses, and they do not give those medications; then we apply cautery at the end, and it cures; then it comes about that cautery is the last medicine, but not according to the understanding of the common people and many physicians.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this unless due to the equality of gold and the refinement of its substance; and they said that it does not cause a place for cautery blisters.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 But that is not absolutely true; because I have already proved it and found that the same does not cause this in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And cautery itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you make the cautery in fire from gold, it is not made clear to you, when it is heated according to the amount that you wish, due to the redness of gold; and when it moves towards the same coldness, and if you add heat over it, it melts in the fire, and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore the artisan falls into trouble from this; and because of this, cautery with iron is done among us more quickly and closer to the procedure, due to its straightness for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 I have already arranged this Chapter for cautery, according to the chapters: and I have ordered it from head to foot: that whatever they seek in it, may be found by them.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 On the method of cauterizing the Head at the Coronal Suture.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here, the cauterization is applied to the dominion of moisture and coldness over the brain: these two are causes of soda, and the flow of multiple humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally all sickness that happens due to coldness, such as paralysis, soda, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones from these sicknesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is to instruct the sick person: that his head should be evacuated first with a solution of medicine cleansing it for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to make his head warm with a towel.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Whenever therefore your middle finger arrives, mark that spot with something unburnt.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery in oil: whose form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then put it on the marked spot with something unburnt, pressing down gradually with your hand, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then remove your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a piece of bone or quantity of coal has been burned from the skull, then remove your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, put your hand back with the iron itself, or with something else from it if it cools down; until the bones that I told you are seen.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and immerse the cloth in it, and place it on the spot; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place a wet cloth on it (the wound) and let it remain until the burn is consumed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with a four-ingredient ointment, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 It is said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it discharges pus; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 Some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone; and hold the cautery until something deep in the bone is burnt.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then grind off the burnt part of the bone afterwards, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 Others say that when the cautery is reached to the end, it should be pressed onto the bone so that it falls off like a curette shape, or an instrument which women place in the vagina with a small amount of alphabet: and they think that vapors of the head escape from this place, and the wound should be kept open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then treat it until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 To me, these two types of cautery seem not to be at all useful except in certain people according to the path of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And let it be, for me it is better with his own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 Indeed the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in other limbs; and especially when the head of a sick person is naturally weak, the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it: therefore work with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on cauterizing the head in pain throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	 Head (III).
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When there is a chronic pain throughout the entire head and it lasts in the sick, using herbs, cooking, head shaving, oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, as I said, and does not receive anything from those (others): then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the sick person is strong by nature and not weak, and it finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery under it slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it on all the horns of his head with a cautery, so that the skin is not penetrated, and the amount of bone exposed as I said is removed.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize it with one cautery on the occiput of his head, in the place called 'vas': and it is a place where the ventous (a type of abscess) is placed: and loosen your mouth (apply suction) there, and do not expose bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the sick person experiences intense pain from that (the swelling), and different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I say that this Cautery is to be used in its place: and it must be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the occiput more subtly with a cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the way of cauterization for hemicania, both with hot medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and swelling occurs in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is treated with cleansing medicines on the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered, as I said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve completely: then cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with hot medicine burning, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with hot medicine burning is: that you take one tooth of the allium (onion) and grind it into a powder, and cut off the ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then make an incision at the site of pain in time with a wide lancet, until there is a place under the skin where the tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then insert it into the same spot under the skin until it is hidden; then press upon it with a small piece of lint and bind it for fifteen hours, and then let it be dissolved, and remove the onion, and leave the wound open for two or three days: afterwards place a piece of butter-soaked cloth over it until a pus forms: then care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to perform this with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on Middle Eastern Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 Cauterization of it with iron is performed in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The form of the Iron Cauterization is as follows:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 It is called a Claw-shaped iron. The shape of its head resembles that of a nail, with a roughness on it and a small projection in the middle.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the location and hold your hand steady; and you should slowly rotate the iron with speed, so that the amount to be burnt is of the thickness of the skin, as half its size.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And remove your hand so that the artery below is not burned and there is no bleeding.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak the cloth in brine water, and place it over the location and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter: afterwards care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 If you wish, cauterize this half of the head with the second part of the scalpel-shaped cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And be careful not to make an incision on the artery in this half of the head, except when necessary.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 Method of performing cauterization for old-age headache.
Caput V.	 Head (chapter).
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat headache and what we have said in the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the disease that what we said about cautery with medicine or cautery with fire is not sufficient for him, then it is necessary to heat the cauterizing iron until it turns white, after marking the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger or similar: and place your hand instead, and squeeze it tightly until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the jaw that moves during chewing, which is located on the side or nerve that moves it, so as to avoid a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And be careful of the caution and the cauterizing iron from the flow of blood from the artery that was cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 Indeed, there is fear in the cutting of it, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent, or experienced: and he first leaves the operation with it.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I will come back with the reminder of the management of the flow of blood from the artery according to its own method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the disease that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see a weak body bearing the cautery in the middle of the head as we have said, then treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you want to administer the cautery as we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 Indeed, cauterization is better for this and more helpful.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 On the method of cauterizing an ear pain.
Caput VI.	 In capite primum de modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When pain in the ear occurs due to coldness and is treated with solutions, and the remainder of the treatment as we said in the division, but the pain does not subside, then cautery by fire; and that which is called the puncture, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then, the puncture with it after its burning around the entire ear as it is rotated; or around either side, if the pain is on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And extend the cautery from the root of the ear somewhat, after marking places with wax; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten punctures in each ear, and as such.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then, care for the locations until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in Strangulation.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Strangulation that is treated with cauterization, is not other than those that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And also avoid cauterization of a species that occurs due to dryness and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When treating this species of strangulation with hyssop, purges, gargarisms, and your treatment does not improve, then it is necessary to cauterize the sick person with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second slightly below his earlobe, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak side.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Because softening does not occur, unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize yourself with a cautery along the edge of the upper extremity of the ear, slightly below the horn of the head; and another on the earlobe; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until the thickness of half the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species from a knife, whose shape preceding is not too subtle, as you see; and it must be that the knife in it should be of little excess in thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the location, with it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Section on the mode of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When the apoplexy becomes ancient, and your care of it with what we said does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over all his skull's horns, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded; and the mode of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also, it is cauterized with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach; and this is more final.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it is taken care of, with what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 Section on the mode of cauterization in oblivion.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in a drink there are first large quantities of hysop, and cleansing pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave completely the head of the sick one, and place on his head an ointment made from myrrh described in the book of ointments; place it on him several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 That is the method of cauterization; make it according to the same order as I have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If he is cured by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make three cauterizations in the back of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; place a thickness of a finger between each cauterization.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cauterization, with what has gone before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If you wish an addition, and the sick one can bear it: then make a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 What if you wish an addition: then cauterize him above two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for it until he is cured; let the cauterization be anointed according to the shape that has been mentioned.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 It is necessary that you proceed with the cleaning of the head with hyson, and with what I have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then scrape the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns of the head, and with a cautery over its posterior part, and three times over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If, however, you need more softening of the body for illness with those [things], and the sick person is weak and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery until most of his skin burns off, and then remove your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then take care of him until he is well: and so cauterize with olive oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 A cauterization should not be performed on an epileptic, unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary to clean the brain of his first with hot irons, and with the rest of the treatment as we said in division: when the patient is weak or endures well in taking medications.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If he is a child who does not endure medications, then gargarisma (a medicine) is administered, and cleansing chewing substances for the brain are given, before that for many days with good food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head as it was before, and with another cautery on his occiput (the back of the head) and over all the horns of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If the patient is strong and endures, then cauterize him with cauteries as I said in the presence of paralysis, and softening of the body on vertebrae (spinal bones) of the neck and back, and let the cautery be olive oil according to the method that was before.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 If the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery as follows:

Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the cause of melancholy are corrupted humors and gross phlegm, then cauterize him with cauteries as we said in the presence of paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of declivities to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moistened, then give him in drink what cleans his brain as before said in division: then shave the head of the patient, and make afterwards a decent tortellum (a small, round piece of cloth) made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it on the middle of the head: and the patient sitting squared should be held from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then present the ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 It is more suitable from old sheep's butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat it over fire with a measured warmth that the finger can bear when it is inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it into the middle of its head in a circle, and let it go until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this to the sick person once a week with the rest of his good regimen until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, cauterize it by making small punctures in it many times, provided that you keep your hand with the cautery; let it be smelling.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place on it a cloth soaked in sheep's butter or chicken fat.

Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	 When you are informed of the beginning of water in the eye by the signs I mentioned in division, then begin and let the sick person drink with him, while washing his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moistnesses, and make him sit in a bath, for some days in fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize himself in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize him on two temples with two cauteries, if there is no discharge of water from both eyes at once: or from one side, if there is no discharge of water from one eye: and cut with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width as wide as the temples: and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something from him, then cut him immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them off, and caution against bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under two bones, with two cauteries at the end of their production.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are chronic and continuous, being above veins and arteries that are manifestly outside the head, it is verified that this is from excesses of cold, phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described in the discharge of water, cauterize in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if it requires addition, then cauterize him carefully on all sides of the eye, at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

When you treat it as we have said in the division, and it does not improve with the medicine: then hurry, and give infirmocochia for three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize him with the same cautery anointed with oil.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 Then cauterize it with a two-pronged cautery, over two eyebrows just under the hairline.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with two cauteries in every part; and let them extend from the two temples; and let the length of all the cautery be according to the length of the eyebrows; and do not place your hand with the cautery at its end, but rather according to the quantity that is being heated for the third eyelash.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 [Chapter title] On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn inward and poke out the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery is in one of two ways: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the cautery with fire, order the patient to let go of his hairs beforehand if he is one who trims them, until they extend and are evened out.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If the hairs poke him at their base: then hold his eyes with a plaster so that they do not move until they grow out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they grow out and are evened out, then place the head of the patient in your lap; afterwards mark his eyelids with wax using a sign shaped like a myrtle leaf; let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a moistened pot on cheesecloth or slippery elm bark over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the cautery, whose form is as follows:
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize over the shape that you have marked multiple times, until the surface of the skin is burned as if it were the shape of a myrtle leaf in its entirety.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 The sign of the health of your work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contract and hairs rise at the spot of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Lift your hand then, and let it go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a cow dung with butter upon it until the ulcer is healed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then apply cautery again to that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If however the hairs are below (the spot): then cauterize it until they rise to their own place; and let it be so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is to be commanded that the sick person let go of their hairs until they grow out and become equal (to each other).
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make it from cloth into the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and uncooked lime each a pound ounce or so, then grind them together with good grinding, and make it quickly so that it does not cool.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then take the paste from what you made onto the cloth that you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place under the eye cow dung soaked in egg white; let the head of the sick person be on your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 Place your index finger on the medicine and press it a little.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you will move it as often as the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, because its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While it continues to feel that bite which it has found, then let the medicine go and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When therefore the ulceration ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And consider then, if you see the eyelid rising as if it is raised by contraction with fire or incision, that is good: and if not, then apply medicine on the place where the medicine does not adhere or blacken, and repeat the treatment until your operation is equalized and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place butter on top of it (the burned area), until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during the operation that you keep the last precaution, lest anything from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes soft after days and something fights from hairs in the eye, then apply medicine on that place which becomes soft from the eyelid, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it, until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes vary in size and quantity.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore according to this, your consideration should be: and do not hide the path of rightness which has concern for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat the fistula, if your treatment does not benefit as we said in the classification of diseases, then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Order the sick person to place his head on your lap and hold his head with a servant between his hands so that it is not moved or shaken with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then put warm butter (infused butter) in the white of the eye or in the slime of the egg on his eye: then apply cautery iron whose shape is this:
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 The cavity should be shaped like the form of a goose-quill pen's handle from one end, as is used for cautery; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to extend upward in this manner.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this cavity is better suited for your task.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then, if the fistula is open, squeeze it out and remove the pus from it; and if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus from within.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place upon it the cautery, which has been heated very well.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand slightly on it near the cautery, from the eye to the nose part, so that your hand does not wander or shake weakly; and place the cautery upon the fat of the eye and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you therefore reach at the beginning of your cautery to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then place the cautery again once, or twice, as you need it; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place the wound with butter, and care for it with an ointment of turpentine, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If more than forty days pass and it does not heal: then place on it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and shave it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cautery for fistulas, which some of the first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Focus on the location of the fistula, and puncture it; then place a fine cannula into the opening, that is, a fine needle, whose form this is.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 Pour into it an amount of a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula well grasped, and let it not shake weakly in any way, so that the melted lead does not run or reach the eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary that you place on the eye of the sick a cloth soaked in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it by a wonderful healing process.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula heals along with what has been said from the cautery, and with treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if it does not heal, then it is necessary to open the nostril opening and guide the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will return to its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 On the method of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Many splits occur in the Lip, which are called Pilus, and particularly in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 When therefore you treat these splits, as we have said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then with a small cautery tool, shape it according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the scalpel.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then put it immediately into the splits, until the cautery reaches the depth of the splits.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 Chapter on Cauterizing a Mouth Fistula.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts: afterwards it becomes old, and the pus runs, and a fistula forms: then treat it, and treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery according to its size, so that it can catch in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the heated cautery into the hole of the fistula and hold your hand until the iron heated reaches its depth and end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then take care of it after that, as we have said in the treatment, until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If therefore the pus separates and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the rotten bone according to where it comes out at its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 Chapter on Cauterizing the Softened Gums and Teeth.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gums become soft due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicine, but it does not help: then put the head of the sick one on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then place the cautery tool, whose shape will come later, on the tooth and insert the hot cauterium quickly into it. Hold your hand for a short time until the weak feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And remove (the cautery tool) your hand; then repeat the cauterization several times as desired.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the weak one fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 The tooth, when moved, becomes firm; the gums softened are tightened and the moisture corrupted is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 On the method of cauterizing teeth in dental pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness or there is coldness itself, or worms, and healing with medicines does not help; then cauterization is done in two ways: either with butter-cauterization or with fire-cauterization.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 Buttered cauterization is when you take cow butter and boil it in an iron pot or a copper one.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take a cloth, and fold it over the end of the wound.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it in melted butter and apply it quickly to the painful tooth, hold it until it cools, then repeat this process several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if desired, immerse wool or cloth in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth. Place hot iron upon it until the heat reaches the depth of the hollow of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 Cauterization with fire is to be done with an iron or brass pipe (cannula).
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 There should be something bulky in the body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then, with cauterization by fire, bring the shape as it comes; place it on that tooth and hold your hand until the cauterization cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Repeat this several times because pain is removed either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 In the application of cauterization, it is necessary that the weak bone fills with good butter and holds it for an hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 This is the form of the cauterization.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize with whatever end you wish, according to what is possible; this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for abscesses.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV (24).
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When the abscesses are due to phlegm and cold moistness, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you desire a rapid digestion of them; then use cauterization with a concave heated iron whose shape is as follows:
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit at the cautery from one of them: and place it (the cautery) on top of the ulcer once, and again if needed, until it reaches the depth of the ulcer.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then let it be for three days, and place a wet cloth soaked in butter on top of it until what the fire has burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then care for it with tooth ointment until the form of the canal is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in laryngitis and constriction of coughing.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When moisture prevails over the larynx of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by cold, then it is necessary that a sick person is evacuated first with soluble medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it (the larynx) in the neck at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor into the skin, unless something of that kind is necessary.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck near the last vertebra of that vertebra's end: and let the cautery be similar to the one used before.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was used before until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in diseases of the lung and cough.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When cough and disease of the lung are from cold moisture, and the sick person does not have fever, phthisis, or chronic disease: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, gentle, open places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cautery be in the shape of a cannula as previously described.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your cauterization is to be by piercing with a cautery called Punctum, whose shape was previously described in the treatment of ear pain; and there should be punctures spaced about thirty apart or so.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was previously mentioned until it heals.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And now let the cautery have three branches, in this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Because the cauterization is to be applied when you use a single cautery in place of three.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Title: Method of Cauterizing in Titillico, for Dislocation of the Arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the arm is dislocated due to aid assistance and does not heal within an hour of its return from dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to this act; then dislocate it slightly, as we have already testified this, at that time, it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient lies down on his back or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then peel off the skin that is inside Titillico towards the upper part with your left hand's fingers; and if the dislocation occurs towards the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then take a cautery with two forks.
Cuius forma est haec.	 Its shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it on the other side, and the figure of the cauterization comes with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And when the cauterization is made with a cautery having three prongs, then the figure of the cauterization is that of six cauteries: and there are prongs according to the subtlety of the skin tested.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes one is added to this method, so there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place upon the cautery stretched rods with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make the sick person quiet so that a limb is not moved at any time until it recovers.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if a dislocation is towards the upper part, and it rarely happens, then cauterize the same on the shoulder with a curved cautery, or with many cauteries poking.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For union strengthens, and moisture is removed; and the sick person recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 [Paragraph] On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When coldness and many humidities occur in the stomach until it separates itself from its composition and produces many catarrhs on it, and continues with unproductive methods of treatment: then the sick person must lie down on his back, and extend his legs, and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries, with a cautery under the size of one finger on the chest with a curved cautery, and two cauteries below from both sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries comes to a triangle.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And stretch between them so they do not join together when pus forms.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery shall be the size of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And the figure of the cauteries shall be in this shape without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let the cautery that is made for this cauterization be one in the shape of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it for those who are afraid of the cautery, and it is to be marked on the stomach with signs according to the quantity that you wish with encaustic wax; then cauterize it with the same cautery as the puncture; then care for it with the cure that preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 On the method of cauterizing the epigastric vein (Epigastric artery).
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness and dampness, or from thick wind that does not leave by its natural discharge, and the patient is treated with what was said but it does not improve in him; then the sick person must lie on his back on his neck, and mark with encaustic wax three cauteries according to this shape, and the same quantity below in the epigastric area, where the arm reaches; and let there be a space between each cautery according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be according to the length of the straight body, and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the quantity to be burned from the thickness of the skin be not added to half of it; and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has already extended his legs and lifted his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And you yourself can cauterize these cauteries with a surgical cautery when subtlety and wisdom are present in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And beware that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is burned, for the body is burned entirely, and it reaches to the intestines; since the skin there is delicate, know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 Method for Cauterizing Liver Abscesses.
Caput XXX.	 De modo cauterizandi apostemata super hepatis.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When there is an eruption (abscess), and you wish to know if it is in the liver's flesh or its covering: then if it is in the liver's flesh, a weak pain and heaviness without sharpness occurs: and if it is in the liver's covering, with pain there is intense sharpness: and you see that the treatment of it has tired the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, let the sick one lean on his neck (shoulder).
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then make a figure of the abscess's place with hot iron (encaustrum): then heat the cautery that is similar to a rod (cauterium).
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize it with one cautery until the entire skin is burned and it reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with cure of abscesses, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not necessary to use this cautery method unless one's dedication extends to the art of medicine, and whose hands are afflicted by these diseases at times through experience: then let him dare on such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But it is better for him to be dismissed by me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI (31).
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said that the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia (a plant) should be applied to a cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is to receive from the dry roots of Aristolochia (plant) a longer root, which can be found there, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil: and ignite it.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize it with one cautery at the point between the joining of the clavicle (furcula) and neck, and with two small cauteries under the chin a little below the jawbone.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly towards the back; and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another on top of the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two floating ribs; and with two cauteries from both sides of the chest, below one that is between the two floating ribs.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be on the skin that is noticeably smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some of the ancients have said that there are people who use a cautery similar to an iron rod and heat it up, then push it inside where the ribs are, until they reach the apostema with it, so that pus comes out; as we said in the treatment for Epatis abscess.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at the site, which is not healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 § On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Head, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you are treating the sickness of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cautery on it is to be used according to three methods, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of them is that you make three or four cauteries in a row along the length of the spleen in the form of the cauteries of the liver (which was described earlier).
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the thickness between each cautery should be the size of a finger or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And the method of cauterization should be equal to that which was said in the cauterization of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery; and the sick person should lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method for cauterization is: hold two rods of fire, which we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and peel off the skin that is directly above the spleen, where the invalid's elbow arrives; and let your elevation of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the rods fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then introduce two rods of fire very deeply, until they penetrate the skin from the other side; then remove the cauterization; thus there will be four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a cauterization having three rods.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cauterization after you have released it to emit pus for many days; for it is more effective than what has come before in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 A cauterization does not fall in Hydropsy, unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat Hydropsy with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the navel, and one over the stomach, and another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind the back between the loins, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the quantity of the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then release the open cauterization, so that it emits pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the invalid from treatment after the cauterization with it; for it is necessary that two intentions are applied to him; and healing will hasten towards him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cauterization with which the abdomen is cauterized should be clavilis; according to its previous form; and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive oil, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 On the manner of cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 De modo cauterizandi Pedes, crura et membra inferioria.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they are punctured in Hydropico and filled with citrus water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the Foot in the nocrati, which is between auricularem and anularem: and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not return it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The citrus water will run out, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the tip of a scalpel-like cautery: and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, about half the length of the leg: and over the whole hip, two cauteries: and leave the open cautery without long treatment: so that some water runs out: then treat it with what I have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 On the method of cauterizing in the solution of the Belly.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution of the belly is from cold and moisture, until it weakens the powers retained and digestive, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of treatment, and it does not heal: and you see a person suffering, who can tolerate an excessive cautery due to strong powers, then cauterize it with a large cautery on its own stomach, as was done in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle claw cautery: and with a large cautery over alcatin above the alhossos, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive moisture, and a person suffering from it, then cauterize it with a cautery on the backbone, and a cautery over the entire pelvis: and perhaps you may add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The progressing treatment whose help is not in error.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 On the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids or one in the anus, and they are made of thick, cold, or corrupt fluids, and they are treated as previously mentioned, then the cure is not effective: then cauterize three cauteries on the lower part of the loin slightly triangular under the almeidate, and a cautery beneath the navel about two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If you think that the person's stomach is chilled and food is not digested, and you observe his face turning pale, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously mentioned: also cauterize on Epar (possibly the liver), and another on the Spleen of the same person, with a cautery claw: leave the open cautery for some time: then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterizing Althelul after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you remove althelul (a type of tumor or swelling), then heat the cautery which resembles a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert the heated cautery into the removed althelul: and with your last hand, bring it to the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If therefore there are many althelul (tumors), then cauterize each one with a cautery as previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them, with the treatment suggested by their ointments, until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on his alcatin (possibly the abdomen), it is more effective for his benefit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterizing a Fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the sick person does not obey the incision and surgery as we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he will heal with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 If a fistula occurs and it becomes hardened, pus runs out of it, and its moist parts are corrupted.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, as is proper, you should test it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then recognize the depth of its size with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat up a cautery similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert yourself, heated (cautery), into the fistula and observe how deep you have gone with a claw.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all corrupted bodies are burned up, either once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity of your case.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve or a major vein if it is there; or if the fistula leads to the bladder or the intestine, then you must avoid these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not perform this unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place; and be aware that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If, however, the place is covered and matter is cut away from it, and remains for a long time; then you will know that it is healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if no matter is cut away from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or that there is a rotten bone inside of it, or something similar; whose memory will come back to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 \* Method for cauterizing the Kidney.\*
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.\*
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or excessive wind, and it weakens the body of a sick person as a result, then you should cauterize it on top of the flanks over both kidneys with a cautery over the entire kidney with a cautery similar to a claw, whose memory has been mentioned earlier.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we cauterize it (the part) in the second instance in almeidatum (almond).
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Because three lined ones are coming.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more useful in healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 On the method of cauterizing a bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and humidity, until the weak person is unable to retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the scrotum above the bladder, where the hairs of the beard begin, with a cautery on the right side of the scrotum and another one on its left. The length of this cauterization should be equal to the size of the knuckle of the little finger. Cauterize it with a lower back cautery or with two cauteries if necessary; the size of the second cautery should follow the first one.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Method of cauterizing the Womb.
Caput XLI.	 De modo cauterizandi Matricem.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When coldness and moistures occur in the Matrix (Womb), and it is prevented from becoming pregnant by this, and its menstrua are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs near their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and a cautery on top of a lump below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be claw-shaped.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 In the manner of cauterizing Anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the humors of the mucosa flow towards the anus and cause its expulsion from its place; and the sign of this is that the leg is extended over the other, when they are compared together: and a location of dislocation is found empty therein.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, it is necessary to apply a weakened cautery over the anus of itself with a similar circular cauterion: after you mark the location around the anus with encaustum, as is revolved: and so that the anus falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of such a shape as that which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large oil-soaked cauterion: and let the depth be made according to the thickness of the skin in its entirety.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the ankle bone and the cause is coldness and moisture, and the patient is ill with it as we said in division, and the treatment does not help, and it deteriorates: then it is necessary that you release the patient from thick humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills, or similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization is according to two methods: either cauterization with medicines that come forth, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cauterization with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of them is that you cauterize on the ankle bone itself with three triangular cauteries in this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space that is between every cautery be of the size of a finger's thickness; and let the cautery be olive-oil dipped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle on top of the ankle bone itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a circle whose shape preceded in the cauterization of the dislocated ankle, one should be such that the entire ankle is contained within the circle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 Burn the thickness of the skin altogether.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is attached to the ankle itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 But if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, in the place where the patient indicates, in which there is pain, and your cautery four fingers deep into the woody part: let the cautery be a knife-shaped one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the sick person indicates that the pain extends up to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a cautery, three, or four, or more, if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if he indicates that the pain is turned towards the shin, then cauterize it there with a single surgical knife-cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And be careful with all your cauterizations that you do not burn the nerve or the main artery by doing so, nor attract bad harm to the sick person through this, or cause a contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 I myself have already seen one and another of those who cauterized above the heel, and burned in the cauterization, and the leg became swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and it was perforated completely, and the entire foot was destroyed: then there followed a rupture of the stomach, and death afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in two parts at the same time, then cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men have said in cauterizing the anus, whose cautery method this is.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar instrument of iron, whose diameter is the half of a palm: and place it at its opening according to its size, or less slightly: and within this instrument there should be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the space be which is between all the instruments according to the size of a knuckle: and let the instruments be open from two parts: and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles: and make handles for them from iron properly fitted in the instruments.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in the fire until it glows and emits sparks: then it should be placed on the pillow of the sick person's anus, lying on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then let him rest for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards, pack it with butter and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with an ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albucasis to his sons, we have little experience with this kind of cautery due to its frightening appearance; and therefore, few await it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauterizations for him who endures it, and it finds its place in his case.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery with forceful medicines is such that you should make two bands containing a perforated armillary sphere which descends from the hinge of his door made of copper or iron, the length being equal to the wall; and in their height there should be two nodes, or as if they were themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let there be the space between the two of this size equal to the thickness of a finger, and be open below and above; and let it enclose each other according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on an amphora of oil, with the sick person lying weakly on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand hard on the amphora of oil.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour water between two circles which has been heated slightly with fire and hold it for the length of an hour; let the sick person bear its biting and burning, since he feels the biting like fire, until the biting stops.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then clean your hand with an instrument and wash the oil from the amphora with sweet water; then let it rest for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter over it until the blackness of burning is removed; and let it run for some days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 The remedy is at the end.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then, treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain spreads to the hip or leg, make a cupping glass with water, as you did with the ankle, equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water: I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take an equal portion of both alkali and unburnt lime; grind each one, and put them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that should enter the radius; and put another pot made of clay under it; throw over the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that they are submerged by a finger's depth; afterwards, compress them with your hand; then leave the pot, until the acid water descends to the lower part of the clay pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then mix that water with another lime and throw it over it; boil until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For it will then be very strong for the sharpness required in many medical operations, and in cauterizing other parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines for cauterizing ankles are also such as tesisie, honey from the cardamom seed, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galenus himself has related a cure by an ancient man for the pain in the ankle and sciatic vein, which he highly praised.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not require any other treatment and that it was cured with a single application, until he related that perhaps the man himself entered the bath and came out already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from fresh seitaragus: and if no green one is found, take a dry one, recent: and grind much with some fat, and place on the sore, or leg, or in the hip: and tie it, and leave for the quantity of three hours, or until the patient feels sufficient heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then insert it into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes warm, immerse him in the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain departs, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medications unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides says that goat's droppings, when they are cauterized on the sciatic vein, bring about a second kind of cautery.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place that is between the little toe and the heel, and closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat's droppings, and heat it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing it until sensation reaches the sore and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 This method of cautery is called "Vaccinum" cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Chapter on the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 When there is back pain due to various causes, such as an accident, blow, excessive evacuation, and similar conditions, caused by the infusion of cold and moist matter: cauterization does not apply except in this one case, which is made from the infusion of cold and moist matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuation of the sick one, with fetid pills and similar ones, three lines should be made on the back where there is pain, each line second to the width of a nail, after signs have been marked with encaustic along every line with five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the sick one's tolerance, and cauterization should be done with cauteriopuncture.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries along with a medial nail cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Section on the method of cauterization for a hump-like growth.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This affliction often occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its onset in children is that it occurs on him during constriction at the breath-taking moment during elevation, and you find in the last vertebrae of the back and their nodes which have already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see that and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery in this shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And the cautery should encompass all parts of the vertebrae equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cautery, take two lines or three; and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it is healed as we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware not to administer cautery in a hump-like growth that occurs in a muscle spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Section on the method of cauterization for gout and joint pain.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When joint pains are caused by cold humors that flow to any part of the body, then when pain occurs in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When therefore gout is treated due to a cold cause and pains do not subside, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is to cauterize him after evacuation at the joints of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be called Oliuare.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if it is necessary to prick on the sole of the foot, then do so with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on all knees with three or four cauteries from every side, with this same cautery called Clavili.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If you need more of this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about as thick as the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what was said regarding cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then prick at the joints of the fingers, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If a pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, on every knuckle and on the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate a weak person due to good care or intake of medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if the regimen becomes good and phlegm evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God using this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 If a rupture occurs in the groins and the intestine or bladder descends towards the testicle, which is beginning, then it is necessary that you order a weak person to abstain from food on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And it should be used from the softening agents, so that the feces may descend from his own belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit on your hands upon his back: and command him to hold his breath, until it comes out, or appears pus, or intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then bring him back with your fingers, and mark with pitch under the incision on his neck, with the sign whose end is similar to half of a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the cautery with this shape until it becomes white, and throw sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then return the intestine, or pus into its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the servant place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick man, and put a reed under him, and another servant is on his legs, and another one on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery on top of the mark, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 Hold him until you follow the bone with it: or take another turn with it if you are not able to reach the bone with it in the first place.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful to observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization hour, lest you burn him and it comes upon him either death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is of no avail.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 It is necessary that the cautery for children should be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care with the remaining ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 Let the sick man lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 It is necessary that you place his nourishment for the duration of his treatment, which softens his stomach, so that the intestine does not come out in defecation or vomiting.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then, when he wishes to operate forty days later, then administer a properly made ligature and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And reduce from labor, and filling of food and drink, and with loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when using this regimen, then it is cured with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will say the cure for ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 When ruptures happen in the remaining abdomen and are beginning, and it desires not to add them, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautionery according to its size: and let what is being cauterized be as the third of its.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then cure it itself, with what I said: and let not more be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And indeed some of the first have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautionery in this manner.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with an enkaustrum, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the cautery chisel.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautionery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing for pain due to rupture or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs in certain members due to a blow or injury; and it lasts for a long time, and it does not help with medication; then it is necessary to be cauterized with the cautionery of the puncture point.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the cautionery be of all members according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its power, and the location of torsion, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If it is cured with the first cautionery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat the cautery upon it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because by the custom of such pains it is to exchange one member for another which is nearer to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore you must pursue them with the cautery until the sick one is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy is sometimes benefited by cautery, with great benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And particularly the type of leprosy caused by corruption of phlegm and melancholy: when considering to burn it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If the leprosy is beginning and you have treated it as described in the division and it does not improve nor stabilize: and if you fear that corruption will affect the entire constitution of the patient: then burn him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known as the fontanelle; second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hairline; two above the two horns (of the forehead); and one behind on the nuchal bone.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And finally, with your hand (holding the cautery), press it gently onto the bone until it makes a small impression on the cheekbone and the cortex is dislocated: to alleviate the expiration of thick vapors from it; and burn also the spleen with the cautery, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If the leprosy is already widespread over the patient and it is apparent: then you must burn with these cauteries, which we have mentioned in the head; and one cautery on the tip of the nose; two cauteries on the cheeks; two cauteries on the spine of the neck; six on the spine of the back; one large one on the heel at the achilles tendon and one on the sacrum; two on the ankles: namely one on each ankle; two on the elbows, two on the wrists, two on the forearms, and two on the soft parts of the chest; and burn it over every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands to those of his feet; and burn it over every heel of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Beware of burning the nerves that are above the last toe of the heel.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes [the cautery] is burned upon the neck of the chin, and another [upon] the stomach, and another [upon] the epigastric region.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that, the more you increase the cautery, it is more helpful, and more contributing.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that, the sick [person] does not find pain in cautery, as the healthy ones do: therefore, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that the cauteries be of various sizes and shapes according to the limbs and joints: according to which they precede in types of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then treat [the cautery] with flour of herb and honey, and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in Fainting.
Caput L.	 Book L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a member [body part] is numbed and treated with medications, oils, plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the numbed member with cauteries, according to the size of the member or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your cautery go somewhat deep into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 Sometimes a cauterization is done for something related to numbness that happens in the hand and foot, in the joints of the back near the nerve exits that move that member; and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to do it, unless he who does it is wise in the anatomy of members and the exit of nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Albucasis.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LXI. (61st chapter)
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaras is putrefied [decayed] and does not gain anything from medicine; then cauterize on it with a deep cautery somewhat, according to the thickness of the skin until the white part is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with a mixture of grain of wheat and lentils with rose oil, leaves of arnoglossa, blood of a pigeon and frog; each should be equal part: mix all these together, soak them on cloth, and apply to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Chapter on Cauterization for Cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LXII (62nd chapter)
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it; then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise ones said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 I do not see it so; because I fear that it may burn [cause blisters]; and I have already seen this many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 It is more correct to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 On the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has Adubelati and it is delayed in maturation, either due to excess causing it, or due to the weakness of old age, when it is decrepitus pauci sanguinis, or due to time and the desire to hasten in the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For itself it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is its shape:
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 Place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery that follows be weak, so that the course of the purgatives may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing a corroding disease.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A corrosive is not anything but a corruption that walks in a member and consumes it, like fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see a corrosion in a place where a cautery with fire can be applied, then apply the cautery with much fire, small and large clamps according to what is suitable for the location where the corrosion is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from all sides until you have eradicated the entire corruption and nothing remains beneath it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then leave it for three days, and place over the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all scabs and corruption have been eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If you see that after three days flesh is born in a healthy way without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then reapply the cautery on what remains of the corrupted locations.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 A corrosion is at times treated with an acidic medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 It arises in the location of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, a cautery with fire is more rapid in its assistance; and I myself have already said that the cauterization of it with acidic medicine is in the division; take it therefore there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing claws and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 This illness frequently occurs in the lower parts of feet; it is a thick, filtered affliction that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 The cautery is indeed in them according to two modes: the cautery with fire, and the cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the one with fire, it should be made similar to a concave cautery like that of a vulture's feather. It shall be made of iron, according to its size so that it contains a nail from all sides. It should be delicate at the edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the hot one on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail, and let it be for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply ointment made with wild honey and salt crushed together on it, and let the ointment remain upon it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place with a healing ointment for it to heal.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they have not been converted and keep occurring on the surface of the body, particularly in hands and feet, then administer cautery with hot water. It is to be noted that you should take a cannula made of copper, iron, or from a vulture's feather, and place it on the nail or althea.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a little hot water into the cannula. Hold your hand and turn it with some pressure, so that the edge of the cannula is pressed on the root of the nail, and let the hot water find its way to the depth, to the root of the nail. The weak should wait for a short while under the scalding effect of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then let it be, as the nail will be uprooted along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Treat them one by one, until you have dealt with all of them on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them after they have been excised, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 On the Method of Cauterization in a Tremor (seizure).
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling occurs in a nerve due to cold or quartan fever or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the dorsal vertebrae, and between every vertebra with a cautery, and in its chest with a cautery, and over its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The trembling quiets with the cautery of oil, and hastens the health of the cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization by Albucasis.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 At times, Albucasis expels foul things from the body, that is, pustules, which are made from corrupt matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, it is necessary first, when they appear, that they be cauterized on top of every pustule with a fine cautery and myrtle wood, the end of which is set alight with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of long arista root.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a convex cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized, at the beginning of their expulsion following this method: and they do not increase: and the superfluous part is broken off making them, and it heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 Nevertheless, it should be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Often there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut near a wound, which happens externally, or at the incision of apostemata, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When this happens to someone, then you should promptly go with your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger over it: and press on it hard, until the blood is held under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place in fire small oil-burning cauteries many in number; and blow over them until they become extremely hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one (of the hot cauteries), either small or large, according to the wound and the location where the artery is severed, and place the cautery upon the vein; then remove your finger quickly: hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the blood is forced out along with your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another one quickly, from those that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not stop doing it with one after the other until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and let no other harm come upon the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it (the artery); especially because the artery is large, unless with one of the four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it is not extracted (the blood).
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is pulled out (the blood), the extremities contract and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it can be tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or they may be placed upon it (the wound) medicines of which it is the property to cut off blood, and tightened with a bandage suitable for constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever administers the amputation with a ligature and tightening with a bandage or by placing on it things that burn (or similar), does not benefit him truly, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If that happens to someone and the doctor is not present or there is no medicine: then begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have said, and tighten it very much until the blood is compressed by the upper part of the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 Do not remove the finger, apply cold water strongly on it, always until the blood freezes and swells, then cut it off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 Meanwhile, consider what it needs from cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Chapter on incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar cases.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 We have already said in the first chapter that every sickness in which it is appropriate to burn with fire using cautery and medicine, as well as its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And there I placed chapters from the neck down to the feet.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 I will proceed in this chapter in the same way, to relieve the one who is seeking the sought-after thing.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, you sons should know what is in this chapter from the fear of what was in the first chapter about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And therefore, it is necessary that there be greater caution because in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, which holds life when the vein is opened, or an incision over a boil, or an opening of discharge, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or an incision on a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling, fear, and death occurs in many.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you that the danger should not fall on you, for sometimes it falls on people like you with the weaknesses of this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there are those who get angry with their sickness and death is easy for him because of his fierce nature, which he finds due to the weakness of his sickness and the length of his evil-doing.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when the sickness is from fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And he who gives his trumpet to thee and tells thee with it that he is well, hoping for health, and his sickness is fatal.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, you should not agree to him who comes to you whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be more violent than your greed and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume upon anything from it unless after a certain knowledge, which verifies at your place the praiseworthy outcome of its arrival.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use for the cure of all your sick ones, prognostication and indication concerning that to which it is fittingly suitable for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in it there is help to you in the obtaining of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, O sons, His understanding, and may He not take away from you guidance and inspiration; for it is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck down to the feet; so that you may be relieved of that which you seek from him and that for which you are in need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on treating the water that collects in children's heads.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this weakness often occurs in children at birth or when the midwife tightens the child's head without caution.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 It also sometimes happens due to unknown causes which are not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed, I have not seen this ailment in anyone but children; and to everyone whom I have seen from among them death soon followed; therefore it seemed good to me to abandon the operation in that case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed, I have seen a child whose head was filled with water and his head swelled every day until he could not sit on himself due to the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture can accumulate between skin and bone or under the bone on the cheekbone (sifac).
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 If the moisture is between skin and bone, and there is a small abscess, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head, a split about two fingers wide; and the length of the split should be like that of two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of trepanation (spatulum).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If the moisture has increased significantly and the abscess is larger, then make two splits in this manner (the same way).
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 If the moisture is under the bone and there is a sign that you see the skull open widely from all sides; and water sinks when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and this does not hide from you; then make three splits in the middle of the head in this way (the same way).
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after making the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie the splits with cloth and wool (to prevent infection).
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then pour wine and oil over it for five days (as a dressing).
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then loosen the tie, care for the wound with dressings and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 Do not release to bind the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick man with dry food of little moisture until he recovers his limb and is healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because it sometimes is more, either in the head, or the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with the incision where the abscess appears and is filled with water, and cut it as much as you are able.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe, do not incise an artery, and let blood flow out, and the sick person dies from this flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Incision of the Arteries which are after the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When catarrhs occur to the eyes or the chest, and it does not ameliorate with treatment of medications, then the final cure is in this, an incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore when you want to incise them, let the sick person shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then scrape the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick person bind his neck with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the places of both are places which are depressed behind the ears and are rarely hidden except in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark with pitch on both sides: and cut one with a lancet on each side, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be made across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you want, insert a lancet under the artery and cut it from above with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 Let the length of the incision be as long as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 When a vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the inside frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If an artery does not appear to sight, then it is necessary that measurements be taken from the ear of three fingers' space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with wax and bind until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And that which must be taken out from blood is 6 ounces, and perhaps you take more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 Entirely it should be cut according to the quantity which appears to you due to the force of weakness and the filling of that artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider for the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 If there remains to the bone anything from a tendon, then cut that so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 Chapter on the extraction of arteries located in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old-time headache or acute catarrh occurs due to acid humidity and heat in the shoulders of the temples, or an old-style sodium, severe, and similar conditions; it is treated with methods of healing medicine but does not help; then we have been accustomed to extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them as we have said.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation for extracting them is as follows: shave the weak hairs on the temples and direct attention to the appearing artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 It is indeed shown to you by its pulse and it is rarely hidden except in a few people, or severe cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden from you, then the weak person should bind his head with any cloth of his; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 If a boil occurs in a place with hot water, wait until it appears to you clearly.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the lancet that I have prepared beforehand.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert the hook into it and pull it out towards the upper part until you remove it from the skin, and let it come out from all sides of the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is delicate: then roll it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut that part according to the size where its ends extend and contract, so that there is no bleeding.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood will not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then empty six ounces of blood until the third (line).
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with thick thread, silk or cord, or a strong cord, so that rot and decay do not approach it before the wound heals, and there is no bleeding.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut off any excess that is between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this during that hour or another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, burn it with the cautery up to the bone, with a knife-shaped cautery, until its ends are cut and the operation is stable at that place.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And it is a better procedure unless the person has a fever, or is afflicted with coldness.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is made from those things that help to stop wetness.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better to use a remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of the arteries, it is necessary to fill the place with heated clay and well-made poultices should be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 After solving it shall be treated with dry medicines which cause growth of flesh, and with liniments until healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation bleeding occurs from an artery, then hasten to cut it with a cautery or fill the place with wax; and tie your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If nothing of these is present to you, then place your finger on it until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 Wrap the place with water of strong cold, until the sharpness subsides, and bind it as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And from this it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, that is, to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades; let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to a garnet (almandine).
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two knives, each of them requires cold; and they do not cut the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since they have a certain roughness, warmth of fire must be maintained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly; therefore this is better than any other work, easier, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with hot iron; and place both very hot until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is removed.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For they do not solidify completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the treatment of sharp persistent lacrimal passages from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When the tears are persistent and there is a course of them from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head; and if nothing of medicine for treatment is added to them with medicines, and you see the face of the patient already turning red, and there is a sensation of walking as in ant-like motion on the forehead; and the eyes are exhausted, moist, so that the hair has been corroded by corrosion; and the eyelids have become warm from the acuity of the tears: then the ancients needed this operation for their treatment, and they called this treatment, "The Knife".
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is to command the sick one to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three equal incisions in the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and one should be in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly below the movement of the arms, and the third on the opposite side: and beware not to cut the arteries which are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the whole length of the incision be three fingers apart: and prepare a piece of sponge or dry cloth, with which you will absorb blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert the handle of two sharp points, immediately following is its form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the first incision, which is near the temple, until the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, together with what is above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do likewise from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the handle, and insert another tool named a sharp scalpel, blunt on one side, not sharp on the other side, into the first incision again.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place its sharp side facing the attached flesh and skin, and its blunt side facing the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and remove with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision stops at what appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do likewise in the middle incision until the other incision.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when blood flows to an equal amount, squeeze the sites from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place linen cloths from old boiling on all incisions, and put on top of them soaked woolen wads in wine, oil or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Observe so that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 On the third day, loosen the ligature and administer much infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with basilicon ointment, and the remedies for wounds until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 On the care of acute tears (eyewash) and catarrhs of the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When anyone has acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs; and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already debilitated; and ulcerated eyelids, and hairs falling out from them, and there is acute pain deep within the head, causing discomfort and sneezing: then take, from these conditions, what those materials (catarrhs) do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be ordered for the sick to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side by width, from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be to the bone; and withdraw your hand from the temples which move during chewing; until the bone is exposed; and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the crack between the two lips of the incision with a heated iron or with linens made of flax.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind it from above with bandages; and moisten the bandages with wine and oil so that no hot abscess occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you release it and see that the hot abscess is about to diminish; then it is necessary for you to scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for it with dry dressing which makes flesh grow; as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch; and prepare plaster from them and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 [Title: On the care of an ear wound]
Caput VI.	 [Chapter VI]
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either it is a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone like iron and glass: or it is from a plant such as chickpea and bean: or it is fluid like water, vinegar, and things similar: or it is some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear, or one of those not added (items) that do not grow in the ear, expose only the ear: if you see a stone then, pour something out of violated oil or sinamon thereon.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze with a powdered mixture, and plug the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you place fragments of cloth or wool around the ear and stretch the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 For many times it goes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with Geista (Pizigaroli subtle), which is this form.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it goes out with Geista, that is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a subtle blind hook few times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not go out through that, then make a tube of iron and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole many times, and plug what is around the tube with wax softened with oil so that the air goes only through the tube: then draw it out with your strong force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 For many times it goes out with what we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not go out in this way: then take from helkalimbat or vinegar (i.e., gluten prepared as birds are caught), a small amount of it; and place it at the end of the radius after you have placed a suitable plate over it; then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have removed the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If it does not come out with all that I have described, then hurry to cut before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of incision is that a lancet should first be applied to the sick person in the head region, and blood drawn out according to its power.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit between your hands and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear in its fatty part at the lower side, until you reach the stone: then remove it together with it, as far as is possible for you with your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then, make the incision from your side quickly and carefully until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If what falls into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not come out for you, then take a fine, delicate probe of this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of that species of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put many pieces on it: then remove them with tweezers or with a fine probe or with suction, as we have said, since its removal can be alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 But the water which enters the ear should be used by the sick person to sneeze and cough at first: and already his ear is full with some heated old one: and it lies on top of it where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it comes out through that (water), it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not (the water comes out), then take many stones of the size of a finger, soft, smooth and heat them slightly, and let the sick person insert one of them into his ear canal: let him salivate on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, it should not cease to do that with stone and stone until all water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out in such a way that you take one from parchment or reed, and insert its end into the ear; and light the other end with fire until it burns much of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do that several times until all the water comes out; and draw it out with a tube according to what was mentioned above in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the case of an animal entering it (the body), if it is small such as a flea and similar to it, treat it as I said in the section on division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of a large body, which appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks; and its removal is easier for all who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the case of worms generated in the ear, when you treat it with what I said in the section on division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears there from worms, then draw it out with tweezers or fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If therefore nothing appears there, then take a tube with this shape, narrow below and wide above; and insert its fine end into the ear according to the size that the sick one can bear; then draw it out gently with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do that repeatedly until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they do not obey you to exit, then surround the ear with a tube filled with poppy seeds as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not come out with what I said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have been experienced in killing worms; and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your outflow be oil and medicine into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, with a small hole at the bottom.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore, let what is pressed inside the concavity of the tube be made of bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take the radium and insert it at the end of it with a proper closure; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish among these into the tube; let it be in the ear; then insert the radium with its cover on top, and squeeze it with moderate pressure until the oil is pressed into the concavity of the auditory canal, and the sick person feels it inside; and whatever is poured into the ear should already be heated slightly with fire; and beware that nothing which distills into it is very cold; for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 [Title] On the treatment of an aural impaction (blockage) of the ear.
Caput VII.	 [Chapter] Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes some infants are born without their ears being pierced from the wombs of their mothers.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 It also happens that an impaction occurs in some people's ears as a result of a wound or flesh born there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 This impaction sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which is not visible to the eye; and sometimes it occurs near the outer ear canal, which can be seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear and is not visible to the eye is difficult to treat in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which can be seen, it is necessary to place the sick person's ear on the sun and look into it; then if you see an impaction, open it with a fine probe whose shape is as follows: its tip should have a small depression in which there should be a slight indentation, and the rest of the probe should be made of soft wood on both sides so as not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore an ulcer arises from the flesh in the ear's meat: then hold it with a delicate hook and cut it with ease of great violence, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If then an ulcer is in the depth of the ear: then take a delicate probe and make it warm slightly with fire; afterwards send it into the ear's meat.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If then you find an ulcer with it, that the patient is weak and has hearing difficulties, try to open it gently; and beware not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen in the ear according to the size of the hole you have closed with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen, dip it in rose water, powdered with sieved asafoetida, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear already suppurating: then it is necessary to remove the linen, and allow it with another piece of linen that you have wrapped in a cerate made with rose oil, until the warm suppuration settles; afterwards care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there should be bleeding: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which removes the described bleeding in the chapter on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the care of Althaea for eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 Those Althaeas that occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore hold them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them off with a knife from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then apply powdered asafoetida.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows out from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 To cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For often they recur when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not recur.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Section on the care of grains on the eyelids.
Caput IX.	 Section IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often something happens in the eyelids resembling sand in its firmness and hardness, and for this reason it is called grain; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid, and the lower one.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation on them is to examine if it is grain coming out from the eyelid that appears, and move it to every part; its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Find therefore a fissure above it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape it from every part with ease, until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it up with a hook and cut it off itself.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 But if its removal is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small cut, then it hurts in some way when this is not done.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the fissure is large: then gather it together with a suture; and care for it until it heals up.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 For unguent restores it and fills it up.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if the grain is inclined towards the inner part of the ear and turns its surface inside, then turn the eyelid; hang the grain with a hook and press it from every side, as well as cutting it off.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched out through an incision, this will not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then clean the eye after the incision of the grain with salted water; and care for the place with it so that it may fill up until it heals up when weakened.

Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The Axeirnat is a drop that is generated in the upper eyelid; it mainly occurs in children; and it burdens their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun, for this reason, because tears flow towards them, and for this you see them lying on their faces constantly, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are always wet under the eyebrows, which has already been swollen; and the appearance of Axeirnat is evident to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axeirnat among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The method of his operation is that the sick places his head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a linen cloth and prepare a swathing within it, and make out of this linen cloth a circle according to the quantity that contains Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place him upon it and press with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath may be gathered together in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in its midst moisture with a spatula-like instrument making incisions along the length, and let there be no fissure greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary that you find the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many cases, Axirnath proceeds out of a fissure in the shape of a white fat knot.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Therefore take it with a cloth, which you have moistened between your fingers to the outside, and you rotate your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware that you do not add to the fissure so as not to reach the eye with the spatula, and thus injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you should add a little to the fissure with ease until it appears.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then take it out, as I have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and press it with small stones.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And among men there are those who grind salt and put it into the depression of the fissure, so that what remains of that moisture may be dissolved.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs in the place, then take care of it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 On the modes of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and causes it to weep excessively as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Of the operation called Ataxmir of the Eye, when the palpebral conjunctiva has been detached from its margins, in order to separate any adhesions that may have formed between the bulb and the upper or lower eyelid, as well as for the sake of examination.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow on the eyelids beyond the normal course under natural hairs, and they turn grey: then they harm the eye, and cause the occurrence of symptoms such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and opacity, until it causes the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmir indeed cures the eyes according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with a sharp medicine, as was stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or Ataxmir cures by incision and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or with reeds, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You must place the head of the sick in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if it does not: insert the awl into it where there is a thread from below the eyelid, and let the awl penetrate with the thread on top, and be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a spoon.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find on the inside part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a blunt spoon coming from the larger tear duct up to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then draw out the thread, and place a small ball of wool or cloth under the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with hot wax in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it must be made in accordance with the size and elevation of the eyelid, because it is diversified in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 From these it is that which requires cutting according to the size of the eyelid, in accordance with the softening of the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then, when you find the spur on two lines that you have marked, begin from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, such as a tumor of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape it entirely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then bring the two lips together with suture, with a sharp needle and fine woolen thread: and clean the blood, and make adhere what overflows from the threads on top of the eyebrows, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not cure.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and the threads for three or four days; afterward, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and take care of it as it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and the joining of it; but this will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing was taught by the ancients, Ataxmis.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern for the patient in it, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also in Ataxmis: and it is to mark on the eyelid a figure like that of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then raise the eyelid with three separated or connected hooks according to the following shape, then cut what overflows with small scissors according to this shape with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it does not fit; then take a point with thread, and insert it in the center of the figure: and insert another thread near the greater lacrimal, and another thread near the lesser lacrimal: and bring the threads together equally between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then loosen your hand with an equal lever: and loosen the skin over which is marked the tumor, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If however a boil should occur in your incision or wound: bind that boil with lint and similar materials, from ointments that soothe.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn over.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to use as we have said in the incision: but the suture of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 On the care of Ataxir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the cleft that is inside, as I have told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then make two dogs or two thin logs of appropriate length as the length of the eyelid and narrower than the width of the palpebra; and now you have cut at both ends of each side where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then bind each one on top of the excess from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the two dogs on both sides with a strong binding, and let it be for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 The skin bound will die, and darken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it slows down, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has hardened, remove the eyelid and do not pluck the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the form of two dogs which you will make according to this shape and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 On plucking out painful hairs from the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is to take a thin needle and insert a silk thread into it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then bind the ends of the threads together with a very fine knot; and the length of the threads should be one palm's breadth.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then take another thin thread called Alinshat and place it under the first one for a short distance and knot the ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then let the weak person place his head in your lap and bring it near to the sun so that the operation may be seen; since the operation is delicate or small.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then introduce the probe sharpened (or pointed) into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you draw out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull the hair out up to the probe (or pointed instrument): introduce the probe into the hair follicle; if there is one or two or three hairs, do not introduce more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand with it (the probe) until the hair comes out with the probe along with the natural hair from the eyelid.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the probe is pulled out and no hair comes out with it: pull the probe downwards, using the thread you have tied to it, until the probe comes out through the upper opening, and you see it in the sight of the eye: then pull the probe, and the thread; extract both, and close the eye; leave it closed for two or three days so that the hair adheres to its place, and new flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then attach a long one from the natural hairs and pull them together; or leave it (the short hair) until it grows longer, and then pull it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the care of the eyelash that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this condition (eyelash problem) occurs in the eye, it is called "Leporina".
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this eyelash condition may be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, the accidental eyelash condition occurs from the congealing of a wound, a cut, a cauterization, and similar conditions.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of treatment for this condition is to uncover that congealed area and separate its edges, place a clean piece of linen cloth between them, tie it in place until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 It is not appropriate to use in the treatment of this condition substances that dry and constrict, as doing so will make it worse; instead, use substances that soften, such as fenugreek; embrocation with water, in which althea has been boiled, and linseed; and unguento dyaquilon, which has been softened with some oil; and apply the linen cloth dipped in this, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Thy treasure of cure is, that thou strive with all thy skill, so that it not become consolidated, according to the form which was first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This operation indeed, which we said, is nothing but a correction of Alzahraci, so that the form of the place does not return as it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 On the treatment of Alzahraci that is done on the lower eyelid, and it is a swelling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This which is below, is what is truly called Alzahraci.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a crack, or cautery, and suchlike.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the procedure in this is, that you take a needle, with which there is a double thread, and you dye it in flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh with the needle towards the upper part, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If then the form of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take a cautery, and place it in the crack, and turn the eyelid with it; and break two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let their ends be from the two angles of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when gathered together, the shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh to the extent of its sharp lower side, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather the separated parts; or gather it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what we said, regarding softening medications, and linen, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, either by suture or cautery: then it is necessary to open the fissure flat under the eyelashes, as was previously described.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate with linen between two lips, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The summary of the treatment for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is to carry out the operation on it according to the preparation method for Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For it is of many diverse shapes: and the skillful craftsman prepares his skill with whatever method is possible for him, until he makes it return to its natural shape or nearly so, and the sick person himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in various dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Chapter on the adherence of the eyelid with conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Whenever this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the whites of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of a rod under the eyelid and lift it up; or stretch it with a spatula; then cut the adherence with a fine spatula, not with the sharpness of a spatula's cuts, but rather bluntly; so that the sick person is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not harm the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be like scraping off the adherence easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the adherence heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salt water into the eye, and rinse it with water; or distill it onto him from sifon made of sieve cloth soaked with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen strip: and place upon the eye wool soaked in egg white: and after the third day use it or with salves, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 On the incision of a nail and swelling of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is horny: and it is similar to the hoof, hard and delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not horny, similar to frozen white moisture, which when it touches the iron or you try to catch it with a nail, it breaks off and does not stick to the nail.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both types do not begin unless from the greater tear, until it gradually spreads, until it covers the vision, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operating on it is: that you place the weak head of yours into your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then gather the nail with a nail of twofold length and extend it to above.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a needle and insert it into the nail with hair from horses, oxen or sheep; and let it be thread, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fasten it in the middle of the nail; and pierce it with the needle and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it to above; and remove the scab from the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you are holding it with hair up to its root.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the rest at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or with small forks; and let out the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that there is no continuous flow of tears from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes a nail is extended with an uncion (a thin, curved surgical instrument) alone; or with a lancet, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft curette of this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful that the curette does not touch the corn's skin, and a fracture does not occur there, and the pupil is perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, throw into the eye something of crushed salt or made from zinc, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of it as necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle into it or the uncion does not fit, then this type of nail is often treated with medicine and heals as I have said in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you want to cut it (the nail), then open the eye of the patient and take a thin, soft, weakly sharpened curette in this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape the nail superficially with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it is becoming rarefied and crushed, and the scraper presses on it, then distill from your hour into the eye, made of zinc, or red sulphur, or crushed salt; and close the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat this operation until the whole thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless it is a warm abscess in your eye; then leave the nail and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat this operation with scraping until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 However, if the growth of flesh from the tear duct is harmful to the eye to a great extent, it should be suspended with an uncion and cut out that part of it; and do not make the incision too deep, so as not to damage the tear ducts.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then apply the milk or red colloidum, or that made from zinc, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 On an Alguardenic incision and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 There sometimes arises in the eyes of men a red flesh composed or placed upon it that covers the pupil, approaches, or contracts over the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids toward the outside, resembling the balustrade rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the treatment for it is also that the weak one puts his head in your armpit.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and gather that flesh in its entirety with suitable forceps, and hold it with a single fork or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then make an incision in the flesh first, until it is entirely separated by the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful not to injure the eye during operation; and let your incision be such as that which we described in the operation of the nail, or with small forceps like those used for excision of the appendix, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your incision is completed and the Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with brine or sprinkle a red powder and similar substances on it from corrosive medicines; and place warm cloth over the outside of the eye with egg white to protect it from hot contagion.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If there remains something of the Alguardenic and warm blood prevails and you fear a hot abscess, then release the eye and treat it with what cures an abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do the same with the added flesh that sometimes occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 It is necessary that every weak eye of an alien, whether from a natural or accidental way, be operated upon with iron, and thou shalt not introduce thy hand into any of these operations, until thou seest that the member is able to bear such operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Collection of the Sebaceous Exudate from the Eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Sebaceous vessels that weave over the eye and hinder vision are called sebels; they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, you must first determine if the eye in which there is sebels, is strong and there is no other illness besides sebels; then collect the sebals of that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it should be prescribed to the weak one, that he place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those vessels with a single or double hook, according to your discretion; and let the hook be subtle doubled, in this shape, or there may be two hooks graded within one body, in this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those vessels with fine forceps with fineness and remove the blood hour after hour until you see the vessels being removed from the eye and dissolved; beware that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 Let your operation be at noon in the presence of the sun, and be firm in your operation very much; so that you do not cut except those vessels.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then pour into the eye either green or red; so that it may consume with its own sharpness what remains from the sebals.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what alleviates eye pain; and leave it for some days until the pain subsides; and it should be purified with warm poultice; then repeat over it in the same manner until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 On reducing the Aphthae to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The physician named Arissethe treats a fistula, which he cures with cautionery or with a burning medicine, according to the account that precedes it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; unless to find above the abscess at its birth, and to draw out all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone appears and you see in it decay or blackness, then file it with this tool, whose shape is as follows:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 The named part is Asperi of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it of iron and let its head be round like an azir [a type of drill], and let it be marked with the engraving of a file, or the subtle marking of aliskilfer, and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it between your fingers and press your hand slightly, so that you may know if the corruption is now scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place is consolidated and flesh grows there and the flow of pus ceases, and it remains for forty days without renewal, without ulceration, and no incident occurs in it; then you will know that it has been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no skill to be found except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this form:
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 It is to be peeled off from the second bone with iron or medicine that is sharp, and when the bone has been exposed, then take the trepan [a surgical instrument] in this form: its end should be iron, triangular; and the wood of it should be a pyramid extended to the end, as you can see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct; and stretch your hand slightly from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn the trepan with your hand until it enters the bone and feels weak: by this you will know that air is escaping from it when you hold your hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore, then restore the place with astringent medicines as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When flesh grows and the place hardens: then the substance that was flowing outward returns to the nose; therefore, it is easier for that to be upon the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 On the reduction of protrusion of the Eye.
Caput XX.	 De resecnditone cataractae oculi.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the Eye protrudes completely and no harm or reduction occurs during sight: then it is necessary to loosen the patient; afterwards, let the phlebotomist bleed him; subsequently, place warm fumigations on his neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Subsequently, place a poultice made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and colophony over the Eye.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Subsequently, tighten the Eye upwards onto a plaster with many small stones.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of the small stones is as follows: Take soft cloths in large quantities and fold each one over four; make many of them; then place one on top of another according to the quantity required by the Eye; subsequently, tighten them with a hard cloth strap firmly.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 Repeat the warm fumigations with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Subsequently, remove the warm fumigations, and leave the eye tightened during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the binding softens again, then it is necessary to tighten it strongly; subsequently, remove the binding after a day and night, as previously stated.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see that the Eye has returned to its original state, that is good; if not, repeat the poultice, the small stones, the strapping, and the warm fumigations until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 Chapter on the incision of the eyelid.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When a rupture occurs in the eyelid, then it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelashes like a grain of sand, and disfigures human form due to this, and there is a desire to cut it; then the operation is done as I described: namely, insert an awl into the root of the eyelash from below to its upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Subsequently, insert another awl into which there is a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate; subsequently, release the first awl according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut a place for the double thread and tie it around the vein with a needle; and tighten it strongly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then extract the needle, and place linen soaked in oil on the conjunctiva of the eye; and wait until the thread falls with the vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye with that which strengthens it until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the vein is tied all around with a circle made of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then pierce with a fine spatula which reaches deep into the eye, and let the moisture of the conjunctiva run out, and let the eye sink down and enter immediately; then tie it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 [Chapter title: Treatment of Alcomant]
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This disease called Alcomant is nothing other than pus that collects in the eye, resembling flowing water and it is not [this pus itself].
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 The method of operation in it is, that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take the head of it with your two hands and move it, until you see pus approaching towards the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then shape it and do not let it fall down, and clean the eye: and let the sick person see as he used to see; and if it does not go downwards, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If it is not prepared for the discharge of pus as we said, then let the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a pointed instrument and pierce it slightly on the cornual continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea at the crown, until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out, then pour hot water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or hot water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; afterwards clean with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Chapter on the treatment of water that falls into the eye or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already said the type of water in division and what suits for piercing by declaring and explaining it, then take that very same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you let the sick person sit between your hands, facing towards the light, near the sun; and tie the healthy eye; and press the affected eye very hard; afterwards close the eyelid of the affected eye with your right hand if the water is in the left eye; or with your left hand if it is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand (almad) if the affected eye is in the left; or take your left hand if it is in the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the end of almad near the crown by the thickness of a radial limbus on the white part of the eye that is visible as the smaller lacrimal sac; then press almad with force; and you turn with it, until it penetrates into the white part of the eye; and feel that almad has already reached an empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measure of the journey be great for deep places, the measurement of the space that is from the pupil until the end of the blackness; and it is the eyelid's circumference.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You will see that within the pupil's vision of the eye, due to the brightness of the cornea membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place a large one up to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it down once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore water comes out immediately, then the sick person sees it right away over what opens his sight immediately, and a large one in his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then remain quiet for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If water comes out again then put it down again, except that the large one goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is blocked and does not come up then pull the large one out easily; and you rotate your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from salt in clear water, and wash the eye with it inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then put outside the whole wool or flax soaked in rose oil and white egg white, and tie it to a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We and those of our time place on him crushed cumin with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the large one does not obey you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard; then it is necessary that you receive a tool called "Alberid", whose form is this:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore drill with it only the joint itself, and do not go all the way with your hand into the opening; and there is no other purpose except to make a subtle way to the large place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce the large one, as we said before.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 For the completion of your work, prepare a well-made bed for the sick person, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house; and let him be prohibited from all movements, coughs; and put food before him that soothes his nature; and do not move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the ligature be according to its own arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then untie that in the dark house and test its sight; make it see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then return the ligature until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not appropriate that it be done during the hour of cure or immediately after the incision; rather, let someone else do it, because water rises quickly with a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If, however, there is a hot abscess: then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what calms the abscess, until it is calm; then without its sight, place it on his oral cavity to regulate his sight for some days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then leave the house gradually and convert himself in his bed.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that in the zaltea (operating room) the student is not excused from seeing often; then he will dare for the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed a certain one of those from Alayrach has come to us who said that in Alayrach a magdan (stone) was perforated through which water rises up.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the old books. It is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the shapes and species from stone for standing on those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them of bronze; and let their ends have the same subtle triangular shape with an acute point.
Formae magda.	 Stone shapes (forms).
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Chapter on the care of newborn flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes various fleshes are born in the nose, among which there is something resembling a scorpion of many feet; and from it is cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark colored; and from it is the soft flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, for the soft and non-deceptive flesh, not cancerous, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit facing the sun with his nose opposite, and open his nostrils, and throw the hook into those fleshes; then draw them outwards, and cut what you have caught from them with a subtle sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains from it, whose excision is not possible; then shave it off with one of the subtle instruments easily, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates over you or a hot boil happens; then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is from malignant boils, then rush to cauterize him, until the blood is cut off and all the fleshes are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nose opens and moisture comes out up to the palate, then you know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If moisture does not penetrate as required, then you know that within it there is a born flesh in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a linen thread with a certain thickness and many knots; and place between each knot the amount of a finger or less; and let the sick person insert one end of the filament into his nose with a spoon or as possible for him after he has made it similar to a syringe; and draw out the smell, until it reaches the cavity, and comes out on his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed many times do boys in schools make something similar to that of Attotus; and it is an easy thing for him who desires it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the thread, one which comes out above the nose, and the other which remains within the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then the flesh is cut with a scissors having knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Make that, until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then draw out the thread; and place within the nose linen that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or more, until the ointment completely corrodes what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place at the end of the procedure within the nose a tube made of lead, for some days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If it requires treatment to dry it out, use that (the ointment).
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For the purging of the head (snuff), when olive oil and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or brass; that it be similar in size to a small lamp, open like a snail shell; and its passage likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the snail-shell instrument for purging the head should be full, pierced; having a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when heating oil or whatever you wish from distilled juices and fluid substances within it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Chapter on the cure for Thelul (nasal polyp).
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often in the end of the nose arises a Thelul (nasal polyp), and it grows and becomes larger with days until it becomes a foul sight.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And therefore it is necessary to cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and root out all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place upon the location, either a cautery, or a medication burning in its stead.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If the incision is slow to appear when enlarged, then consider if it is hard and blackish, with few senses: then do not touch it with iron; because it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For often I have seen that when someone cut an abscess, there was great evil that befell him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the abscess is soft when touched and not blackish, and you see that an incision can be made in it entirely, then evacuate the weak, and cut it without fear or trembling: and care for the place with it as it drains and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Chapter on the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when there is a break in the continuity of one of these cartilages, an operation will bring little benefit to it, unless in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something happens to anyone from one of them (cartilages), consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then apply the two wounds together with suture; then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the continuity of the lips is already separated and each part has become healthy: then it is necessary to remove all layers from the visible skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then join the two lips with suture, tighten them, and sprinkle over the blood of the dragon (alcohol) and crushed aloes: and place on top of powders a fragment of plaster called diafinicon, and some other more consolidated plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it (the plaster), and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is that you gather the solution of continuity, or with hooks, as we told you in the suture of the abdomen; or gather the solution with thread, as I taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 On the Extraction of Lip Nodules.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people indeed suffer from hard ulcers similar to the seeds of a plant in the inner parts of their lips; and some of these are smaller, while others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you turn the lip and pierce over every nodule of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with lime until the blood is shed off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is washed with vinegar and treated with it on the place where there is stiffness until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 On the Incision of Born Flesh Above the Gingiva.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Multitiples times grows-on flesh on gum, which ancients called abscess.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore it is necessary that you hang-it with a hook; or hold-it with forceps, and cut-it near the root, and let-it run pus (or blood).
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place-on top of the place powdered zogia or other healing powders, dried.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut-it again and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Chapter on the shaping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When accumulations gather on the surfaces of teeth from both the interior and exterior parts, and between gums (hard layers), rough, rotten, and sometimes turn yellowish or green, until corruption reaches the gum, and teeth become foul because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands and his head in your lap, and file-down the molars and teeth, where the hard layers appear to you, until nothing remains of them; and similarly do for blackening, yellowing, greening, and others, until they are clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If that which is in them is removed from the beginning of filing, good; and if not, then repeat the filing on them on another day, second, and third, until finally the effort reaches what you wish for in it.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires filing instruments of various forms and shapes; according to which it is prepared for your operation; because the filing instrument with which you file the tooth from below is different from the filing instrument with which you file between teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of filing instruments should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 On the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Caput signifies Chapter or Title. So this is the title of the chapter which translates to "Chapter XXX" in English. The Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis likely has many chapters, and this one is the thirty-third. In Latin, 'XXX' stands for 30, hence the translation as Chapter Thirty.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you extract the tooth from its pain with all your skill and not delay in doing so.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For indeed, there is no remedy for it when the tooth is extracted: because its substance is lofty: unless there is an excuse for not extracting it, then when one who is sick must have the painful tooth extracted, it should be firmly set, and you should be certain that the tooth causing pain has been removed.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Often pain deceives the sick man and he believes that it is in the tooth and extracts it himself: then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have indeed seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When you are certain that the tooth causing pain is indeed present, then it is necessary to make an incision around the tooth with a lancet, which contains something of virtue, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps first gently, until you dislodge it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps in that location and grasp the head of the sick tooth between your knees: what you have now firmly grasped, so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth in a straight line, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it still does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or rotten, then it is necessary to fill that hole with a cloth and bind it with the tip of a thin radius so that it does not break during your compression on top of it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 It is necessary that you thoroughly make incisions around the gums from every part much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 Maintain your strength so that you do not break it (the tooth), and a part of it remains, and returns over the sickness from that evil which is greater in pain at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 Be careful not to do what ignorant phlebotomists do in haste and their audacity regarding its (tooth) extraction, beyond what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they cause great diseases to come upon men, whose difficult it is for them to break, and all of its roots remain, or some of them; or that they extract it with certain jaw bones, as we have often testified this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then, after the extraction of it (tooth), it is rubbed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there is bleeding from the places (for many times this happens), then rub something from ashes, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it with fire if ashes are not available for you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The form of delicate forceps by which the tooth is moved should be long at the ends, short at the handle, thick, so that they do not split when pressed against the tooth; like the handles of large forceps, until when you squeeze with them, they do not open themselves, nor do they split: short at the end, and made of iron or well-made files, with pointed ends; and on their ends there should be teeth, some of which enter into certain ones, and constrict by a proper constriction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the ends are like the shape of a bird's beak called ciconia and they have strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Teeth and the Removal of Fractured Jaw Bones.
Caput XXXI.	 Head, Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 If [the tooth] remains during extraction and it breaks, then it is necessary to place on the place a hot poultice with butter for one day, or two days, until the place becomes soft: then introduce into it algum, or forceps; whose extremities are similar to the mouth of the bird called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 The form of these forceps is as follows:
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Extremities of them are made like a chisel inwards, or scissors-like.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If these forceps do not obey you when exiting, then it is necessary that you be cautious on the root, uncover the entire flesh, and insert an instrument called a small plancca, whose form is as follows:
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Let the end be short and slightly thick; and let it not be saturated so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root exits through this, it is good; and if not, help with these other instruments whose forms are as follows:
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The first form is triangular in end, where there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The form of the fine triangular end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also helped by this instrument with two limbs, whose form is as follows:
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And also with other instruments and tools that preceded in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also help with this instrument that resembles a large hook, whose form is as follows, triangular and twisted end, where there is some thickness, so that it does not break; and let it not be saturated.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many instruments of teeth; and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and the skillful artist, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument according to what the operation and illness itself signify.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because among illnesses there are those for which no ancient instrument has been said, due to the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the face, or it putrefies; then to examine on top of it in its place with that which suits it from the instruments and forceps that I said for extracting roots, and help with gesti whose form is as follows:
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Place something of some thickness gradually within it [the wound], so that the bone may be held or tied and not escape and move away, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with suitable medications for that purpose.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape it off from its rottenness, and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On locking protruding teeth on others [teeth].
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, it becomes a foul formation; and especially when it happens in women and girls, namely those who menstruate.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore one must consider [the cause of the problem].
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth has been born after another tooth and it does not fit or can be locked without grinding [the tooth], then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it off with this tool, which has the following shape:
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 The instrument resembles a small beak and is made from sharp-tipped iron.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your incision be one that you make over many days, and due to the hardness of the tooth, so that another tooth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it projects out for sharpening: then file it with the file whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let it be entirely made of iron, and its handle small but with many pointed knobs, like a file used to sharpen teeth: with this you can grind the tooth gradually over many days with ease, so that another tooth is not disturbed, and it falls out; then smooth it with some files.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it must be filed down until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made smooth; and it shall not hurt the tongue nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Chapter on filing teeth with gold files.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When there is a shock and commotion to the front teeth due to striking or falling, and the sick person cannot clench on what they eat to prevent it from falling down: and you have treated them with medicines that stop bleeding, but the treatment was of no avail: then, in their case, it is appropriate to clench them with a gold thread. Because silver turns green and becomes putrid after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And make the thread fine and thick according to its quantity that it can pass between the Teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And the type of knot is such that you take the thread and insert it between two healthy teeth; then you weave with both ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the end with the needle to the healthy tooth of the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the weaving up to the part from which you started; and hold your hand with finesse and wisdom until it is completely secure; and let your binding that binds the thread be near the roots of the teeth so it does not go out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the excess parts of the thread with scissors; and gather both ends together and twist them; and hide these beneath a healthy tooth and a moved tooth so as not to hurt the tongue; then release it in such a way that it remains tight.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is loosened or cut, bind them with another thread, and it will remain so for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the shape of teeth and the pattern of knotting of two healthy teeth and two moved teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes a tooth or two return to their places after a fall and are held as we have said, and remain so; and this does not happen unless the skilled craftsman is both cunning and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes one of the bones of a cow is made like a tooth and placed in its place, where it is secured and bound as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Regarding the incision of a ligament which occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 "De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et inhibet locutionem.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Whenever this ligament that happens under the tongue is natural, which is born with man, or accidental, from a healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation on it is to open the weak bone at its head in your throat, and lift its tongue: then cut that nerve-ligament across, until the tongue is released from its grip.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted, and it is from the healing of a wound: then thrust in the hook, and cut through it crosswise, until you reach the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware that there is no deep crack in the flesh, and do not cut an artery there, and let there be a blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is rubbed in the wound trace with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a piece of flax from the linen under the tongue, which the sick person should hold every night: so that it does not heal again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If there is blood flow, then place crushed alum over the place.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if the blood overpowers you, then cauterize the place with a purging cautery that is suitable for it: afterwards take care of him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on the removal of ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes under the tongue there occurs an aposteme resembling a small frog that prevents the tongue from performing its natural function, and it may grow so much as to fill the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation on it is to open the weak bone before the sun: and observe the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it black or dark, hard and insensate to the sick person, then do not touch it because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 If it is cut to white matter, where there is moisture, then throw in the hook, and cut it with a thin chisel, and release it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If blood veins over you during your operation hour, then place a soft rag upon it until the blood is cut off; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then clean it with vinegar and salt, and care for it with suitable treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Section on the treatment of two Molar Abscesses.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 When glands similar to goiters occur within the throat, that is, the two amygdales: when these are not cured with what has been said regarding division, then consider them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard aposteme of dark color and few senses, do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and its root is thick: do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either pierce it yourself or it will burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 If it is white in color, round and its root is subtle: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 The operation on it is to consider before the operation if the aposteme has been quiet for a long time and completes its heat or if it decreases slightly: then let the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should be in your lap; open his mouth and let him take a servant between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, whose form is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or copper, which is delicate like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When you press his tongue with it and the aposteme is revealed to you and falls on top of it: then take a hook, and pierce it into the amygdale, and remove it as far as possible from within, taking with it something from the linens.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument of the following form.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It is similar to forks; however, its ends should be curved so that the opening of each of them is directed towards the other's sharp point: ensure that it is made of steel or ivory impregnated with alcohol.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If this tool is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 The instrument should be sharp on one side, not on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you cut one almond, cut the other in the same way as this cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the cutting, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there occurs a bleeding in him, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegranates have been boiled; or leaves of myrtle, and similar ones from other plants, until the bleeding stops: then take care of him until he is cured.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils appear in the throat besides the two almonds.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut them, therefore, as I said in cutting the two almonds, equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself, moreover, have been healed of a woman who had a boil that was born in her throat, which drew to the swelling, few senses, which almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow mouth, and already she had forbidden her food, and drink of water; and it had already come near to death, if it had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The boil had risen only so far that it expelled two branches, until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I therefore hastened and tied one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out, and a large piece was drawn out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut it off where it was seized from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did to it what came out of the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth, and pressed his tongue; and afterwards I tied a hook to the boil; then I cut off a part of it, and no more came out but a little blood: therefore the throat of the woman was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she received food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not stop cutting from that ulcer for a long time; and the ulcer succeeded in the place which I was cutting, until it was extended too much and with that (it) [the extension].
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I have prepared (myself) and burned an ulcer at the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore I stood still for a while: then I walked away from it, and I did not know what God had done with that (situation) after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 Chapter on the incision of an ulcer of the windpipe.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When catarrh goes down to the windpipe and becomes an ulcer that is long, it is then called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, it is then called uva.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is cured along with what was said earlier in the division, but the cure does not work; and you see that the ulcer has become warm and subtle, then it is necessary to cut (it).
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if there is a round gathering from it which is not long, and it is bloody or of dark or black color, and there is no sensation in it, then it is necessary to make an incision on it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear over the weak (one) in it.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it according to the way that I said from whiteness and its length, you should make the weak one sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the tool whose story was told earlier; then attach a hook in the windpipe and pull it down; and cut it with one of two tools that I said for the incision of two amygdalas.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it is necessary not to cut from it unless that which is added exceeds its natural limit without further addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut more from it, you injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision use what was said for the incision of two amygdalas; and cure it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the patient is afraid of incision, then it is necessary to use art in the cauterization of him without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization is not otherwise than with sharp water: it is to place the head of the sick one in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument that I mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take water that I told you in the chapter on cauterization and make a not-extinguished lime from it, and do not make it thick or thin, but fill the hollow of this instrument with it whose shape is as follows: (the text does not provide an image, so no translation provided for this part)
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the end where the medicine is placed be concave, like the concavity of a cochlea's ray.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument with the medicine on the ulcer itself: let the sick one lie down on his side so that the saliva comes out from his mouth through the internal medicine, and let nothing descend from it to his throat, and hurt him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you apply it to the ulcer for a quantity of half an hour until you see it become darkened and the biting of the medicine subsided.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you want to take the curette, and wrap it around the end of the ray, and pour the ointment with the medicine over it, and insert the ray with the ointment-covered curette on top until the ointment adheres to the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then release it: for it burns and falls after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to repeat the medicine, do so: and after cauterization, wash around the ulcer with ointment soaked in butter, and clean it with what is in the surrounding area of the ulcer: and rinse it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And it shall be treated externally with leeches, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This kind of treatment is healthier than surgery and further from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes a vein is also cured with something more subtle than cautery and incision; it is cured with fumigation, in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calaminthe, hyssop, oregano, rut, sage, chamomile, and absinthium, and similar herbs from the plants; mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, boil them; let the pot be well coated with clay; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which an instrument concave in this manner is placed.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it from silver or bronze; insert the end into the mouth of the sick person, so that the vapor reaches the vein through the pipe, until the vein is filled with a large amount.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat this many times, until it burns up.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware not to do this treatment at the beginning of the abscesses growth.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For most often pus is added to an abscess; and it should not be done unless at the descent of the heat from the abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not available to you, then take a pipe and prepare the bark of an ox's horn at its end, so that the bone of the sick person is not burned; since the ox's horn bark prevents the vapor from burning the bone; and this is from good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Chapter on the removal of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or fish spine adheres to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore it is necessary to extract whatever appears from among them that strikes the sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument under the sun, and when it is shown to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what is not apparent to you and hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make [the patient] vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps it will come out attached things through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Either the sick person should swallow a piece of nutmeg, or the root of lettuce, or a dry breadcrumb: or he should take a piece of dried sea-sponge, soft: and bind it, then he should swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it has reached the place where there are spines or bone, and it is drawn out, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out as we have said: then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be thicker than the radius a little, and at its end let there be a notch, which he introduces into his throat with ease: and he should have his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that he does not have a cough, and drive with it the bone or spine, or the doctor introduces it himself with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But what the sick person introduces is better: because of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached: and he pushes downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to its quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Chapter on the extraction of a leech.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XL.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the leech is treated with what I said in the division of the cure with medicines, and it does not heal, then consider at the throat of the sick person before the sun or near the sun after you press his tongue with the tool which I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If your sight falls on the leech, pull it out with a small hook or with fine forceps carefully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them (the instruments): then receive a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick one up to near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this repeatedly: let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a pot full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and wash his bone with it, and do not swallow anything from it; and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 A leech falls off immediately when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out with what we said, then fumigate the sick one with bedbugs, or with asa with the instrument I spoke about for fumigating the throat.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this repeatedly, because it will fall off by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 The method of fumigation is as follows: take a pot in which there are living plums with fire; and the pot should be covered with a lid, through a hole in which the end of the instrument is placed.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the fumigation and let the sick one put his mouth on the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 A leech falls off immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall off, then repeatedly apply fumigation.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 Let the sick person endure thirst, eat salt and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary for this treatment to be carried out.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls upon it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you can see; except that it has this concavity which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 The end of it is similar to the beak of a bird named ciconia (stork), which has roughness like that of a file. When it grasps something, it does not let go of it completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 On the opening of abscesses, and their cutting, and care in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL (40).
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, various, according to their remembrance, namely one and one in this book; and they are different in piercing them and cutting them from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them is by the species of abscess itself and that which it encompasses due to moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second method is due to places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since an abscess happening in the head is different from an abscess happening in the anus; and an abscess happening in a fleshly place is different from an abscess happening in joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from abscesses there are those that should not be pierced unless after the ripening of pus in them and its completion; and from these there are those that should be pierced while they are raw and do not ripen according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Since when an abscess happens near a joint and it is prolonged until it putrefies what is around it, the ligaments or the nerves of that joint are possibly corrupted; which is the cause of the closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or it is an abscess near the main member; since if you delay the piercing of it until it ripens, it will harm either that or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus, pierce it while it is immature; and do not pierce a raw abscess, not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus so that it does not putrefy deep within, extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula or remain incomplete and will not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of perforation of the boil abscess, which has become mature according to the completion; and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuity of the boil abscess head: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the boil abscess, and more pronounced protrusion; and the perforation should be going in length of the body, if boils are on hands and feet, and places arms, shoulders, necks, tendons, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which reflect, go with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the boil abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to let the perforation of it be, until its digestion has become firm, as we said according to the completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many filths and dirtiness, and perhaps its edges harden and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some boils abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body because of necessity; or according to that which requires a member.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary that you administer small perforations in small boils abscesses, and large perforations in large boils abscesses; or many cuts according to the similarity of the size of the boils abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are some boils abscesses in which the skin should be concaved; and it should be cut when it has become like cloth, and made into a point, that it is already dead: as what happens to many, where it breaks out, and to buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them are those which are cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from them is that one which is cut as the figure of the myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them are those where a round section and crescent-shaped section are administered, and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 But that which has no head, such as superficial abscesses, it is necessary to pierce it with a superficial puncture, or only through a shallow one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary when the abscess is large and already contains much pus, to pierce it so that it does not burst out and extract all of the pus at once; rather, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then open the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this repeatedly according to degrees until it comes out; particularly if the patient is weak in strength, or a woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old man decrepitus: for the animal spirit is many times dissolved with the exit of pus; and perhaps the sick person will die, and you will not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your puncture, where you pierce the abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound; and observe.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the section is flat, then administer a bandage made of linen, or an old cotton cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the abscess is large, and there are many openings from the puncture, it is necessary then to insert a bandage into every opening until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if you have cut off a piece of skin from the abscess, or hollowed out its circumference; then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton cloth, or as when the cloth is being sewn, or shorn of linen wool without moisture; and tighten it for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then cut it open and care for that as needed with an ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If bleeding occurs during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar. After being soaked in them, place a cloth over the bleeding site repeatedly.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer a regimen, treatment, and powders as I have described in several places of this book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is winter time and the place of the excision involves many nerves: then it is necessary to pour hot powders with wine and oil onto the locations.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer and the locations are fleshy: then it is necessary to place the powders soaked in water, oil or wine and oil, and keep everything cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said, it is necessary to dissolve the boil, cleanse it, and administer treatment suitable for its healing until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 Therefore, this is what is universally necessary in the knowledge of boil treatments.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 However, according to the method of classification, I have already discussed every type of boil individually regarding how to treat it in detail.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on the cutting of boils that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XL (40).
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small ulcers occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the types of knots, which are contained by the pouches that are like them; as if they themselves were sucked out like chicken galls.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 From these (ulcers) some are fat; and from these some contain a moisture resembling mud; and from these some contain a moisture resembling ointments and poultices; and from these similar ones, and from these there are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the cutting (of all) and their extraction, there is no fear, if it does not make a counteraction of an artery during its cutting.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in their cutting is to test it with an instrument, whose shape comes after this, which is called Introversum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it is that which contains moisture, then cut it with a section along its length with a superficial section in this shape (Intromissum).
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the section from line b to line g. For when the moisture is evacuated, then scrape off the cyst (kistin) that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything inside it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For it often returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and let it be until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For it corrodes what remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat over the wound with the second Egyptian ointment, and the third, and if necessary, as many times as you need until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst, then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the ulcer contains a fat knot: then cut it with this shape (Intromissum), having the form of a cross; and thrust needles between the folds of the section, and scrape it off from every side; and try your skill in extracting the pouch that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterward.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly, in a laceration (wound), if it is caused by a stone, treat it with cutting and the same cure as we have said before.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 Cutting over a stone abscess (lump) is easier because there is little blood or moisture present.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 Sometimes there are such abscesses (lumps) on the head in some people where there is no moisture within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This refers to the following: I made a cut over an abscess (lump) on an old woman's head and found that the abscess was as hard and solid as a stone, rough, white, and could not be broken; and if anyone were to strike it with a blow, he would wound himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other cases of abscesses (lumps) in the head, apart from those that occur in children's heads and at the roots of the ears, cutting them all should be a surface cut.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or, make a perforation in them always from the lower part of them to let the flow of pus run downward.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then, care for these with whatever suits them from our treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Chapter on the cutting of galls (warts) on the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These abscesses (lumps) often occur on the neck and under the collarbones and groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 On those that occur on the neck, there is one type and many; they are formed counter to each other; and every gall (wart) on them is within its own covering, like a knot or an abscess on the head as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 The kinds of these galls (warts) are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 Some of them are hard and stony; some contain moisture; some are malevolent and do not obey the treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In that which you see of good arrangement in touch, whose evident is close to the skin color, and moves to all parts, and is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with vein, nor with artery, nor is it deep: it is necessary to separate it by a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line b, to the line g. And scrape it off from every part: and spread apart two layers of skin with a scalpel, or with many scalpels if needed, as we said regarding the cysts of the head, and draw it out gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And beware not to cut vein, or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 Let the instrument not be very sharp: so that it does not harm you with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If however you cut vein, or artery, then it prohibits you from the operation, then place in the wound zege tritum, or some powders that dissolve blood, and tie the wound, and leave it, until the sharpness of the cyst subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For blood is separated by the skin, return then to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then ask with your index finger if something remains of Straphylus or other small pieces: therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If it is in the root of Straphylus a large vein: then it is necessary not to cut that Straphylus from its root: but it is necessary to tie it with a double strong thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with a gauze that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then care for yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the whole louse is cut, then it is necessary that you gather the edges of the wound and immediately stitch it up when you see that there is no further excess left.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that there remains excess due to the size of the louse, then it is necessary to extend for cutting the root and extracting it; and to administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And what contains moisture from the lice, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that you may see its place of maturity; and place the puncture below that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer after the puncture a linen with an ointment and similar to it, so that it corrodes what remains from corruption, until when you see the wound already cleaned; then care for yourself with a stronger ointment of flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 § On cutting the Epiglottis in the throat from aposteme happening.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said this cutting of the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 But in those with synangiosis, it is necessary to avoid the cutting of the Epiglottis; since no relief comes from that, because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 But in those who have a hot aposteme in the mouth or throat or both amygdalae when there is no illness in the nostrils, it is necessary to use cutting of the Epiglottis to escape from destruction caused by congestion.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we want to cut the Epiglottis, it is necessary that we cut the Epiglottis under three or four circles of the Epiglottis, with a small section across its width, in that which is between two circles by amount; this should be the cutting on sifac, not cartilage; and indeed this place is suitable for cutting because it is deprived of flesh, and vessels of blood are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the surgeon is afraid, then he must stretch out the skin of the throat with a probe.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then let him locate the skin until it reaches the channel; if he sees any, drain the blood vessel.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut as I have said; and it is noted on the incision of the channel due to the mucus that comes out of it with what breaks apart, and from the removal of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And let the open wound remain for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the fear of burning is removed, bring together two lips of the wound skin, and take only the skin itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The summary of the conversation I have related, is not an explanation except when they see that one of these abscesses has already opened on the throat of the sick; and he was raised up above death, and desires to cut his breathing; they go to incise Epiglottis, so that the sick man may breathe over the wound place with some kind of breathing, and be saved from death: and for this reason they commanded to let the wound remain open until the evil of the illness consumes itself, and the evil is itself in three days, and as if it were; then therefore they commanded to suture the wound, and cure him until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And that which I have seen by myself is this: an maidservant took a knife and sent it into her own throat with it, and she cut a piece of the windpipe of the lungs.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to treat her, and found her groaning, as is the groan of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 So I then uncovered the wound, and found a small amount of blood that had come out of the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 I am confident that it did not cut the vein nor the artery; and pus was emanating from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I healed it myself and treated the wound until it became healthy; and nothing happened to the servant girl except a cough; and she returned after days to her better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Chapter on the Section of a Neck Hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This swelling named neck hernia, is a large swelling, of the same color as the body; and it is common among women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It is in two ways: either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Surely, it is not a natural occurrence.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental one is also in two ways; of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other mode is similar to a swelling that arises from a knot in an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear in it, and it should not be presumed upon with a knife unless in the case where it is small; and you test it and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty node and is not suspended with any veins; then cut it, as knots are cut; and remove it along with what contains it from the chest, if it is in the chest; and if not, then thoroughly examine its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with what is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on the Section over the type of Nodes.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many types of nodes, and I have already said all their species in division; and it is necessary that I explain here the difference between a node and an exitum, when there is doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I say, therefore, when there is heat, and fever, and violent pains, until the boiling of superfluidity subsides and corruption is completed: then indeed fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 Therefore, if no heat, nor fever, nor pains exist and they are contained by a purse-like envelope which is specific to them and is of the color of the body; it is a knot, like a chickpea, and becomes like dough, both greater and lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are of two kinds: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you approach the treatment of the Knot, it is necessary that you examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called 'Intromissum', according to its form, which will come in the chapter following this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the method of investigation of boils and all knots is that you take this instrument and insert it into a moist place which you find in the boil; and you move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, finally, place your hand according to the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then remove the 'Intromissum' and observe what comes out following its trace.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If what comes out running is moisture of any color, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in the other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if no moisture comes out in the trace of the 'Intromissum', then you know that it is fatty; cut it with an incision having the shape of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with tweezers, and strip the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the purse over it if possible in order to extract the healthy one with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the cyst is ruptured during the operation and it cannot be extracted intact, which often happens, then extract it piece by piece until something remains from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 If something remains from it, whether little or much, a node returns most often.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it defeats you and something remains from it, fill the wound at its completion with some corrosive powder: bind up the wound, place on top of it a hot sore made of the same substance, care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If there is a large node, then divide its two sides and care for it along with that which incarnates.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If it is a pulsating vein or a non-pulsating vein for you, then go and fill the place with boiled pitch, leave it bound for two or three days until the wound decomposes and blood stops boiling: then return to cut what remains of the node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Chapter on external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter LXVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 Among them are the forms of Instruments, and they are in three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 For there is a large one among them, for there is a medium-sized one among them, for there is a small one among them.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Make them from iron with square ends well-made, so that they enter quickly into the sore.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of Perforators and Knives, and one of them is called Beris, meaning to pierce: they are in three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 For there is a large one among them, for there is a medium-sized one among them, for there is a small one among them.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are joined together so that they can treat sores, ulcers, fissures, and boils arising from the bone that is among them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are round, smooth, soft, such as the large needles with which seats are furnished, namely of glass, or brass, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And the better ones among them are those made of glass.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And there is also experience with black lead, which is used to test for fissures, whose convexity provides reflections, so that they are reflected with softness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because among them are long ones, middle ones, and short ones, according to the size of the fissure and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The form of veins, and there are many shapes.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because among them are simple ones, that is, those with one opening; and there are three shapes as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And there are blind veins; and there are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them are veins with two openings; and there are three shapes for these, as well as veins with three openings, and there are three shapes for these; and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 These are the forms of scalpels, which are used to cut and scrape knots, and growths; and there are three shapes for these, as one large, one medium, and one small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The ends of these which are used for cutting are sharp, the other ends are not sharp; they are not placed thus except to provide aid during scraping of knots near the fear of cutting a vein or nerve; and so that one may recover from illness, and find some relief from pain that is found in scraping growths.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are large, and there are three shapes for them.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of copper, and they are similar to a radiolum, which is used to make alcohol: and at its end there is a hidden hole called spatulum-hole; it flows into the interior and exterior as you wish, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The spatula hidden between the fingers for incision of abscesses: the weak do not receive them; they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The forms of wound-drains for the flow of blood: they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make them from copper or citron, round, slightly shorter in length than you see: and let them be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it is necessary that these wound-drain forms be of various sizes with you, large and small: so that you can drain the blood quickly in case of necessity, and when there is no medicine at hand for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them for draining blood in every part of the body, and do not use them unless in fleshy places: such as the arms of the legs, hips, arms, breasts, stomach, groin, and similar fleshy areas, from moist flesh.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes instruments are made from them similar to the balls of a fist, according to their shape: with which blood is drained when it flows from the site of venesection or incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are round, according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 Chapter on the care of breast-like bumps in men resembling female breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII (47).
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to dream) until they resemble female breasts; and they remain infected with a foul abscess.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever recoils from that (operation), let him make an incision over the mammary gland in a crescent shape, according to this form from the line 'b' to the line 'g'. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with ointment made of incarnated substance.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound with stitching, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If, however, the mammary gland sinks downwards and becomes soft due to its size, as happens with women: then it must be incised on both upper sides in two similar crescent-shaped cuts, of which one is enclosed by the other at their ends so that the larger one contains the smaller, according to this form from the line 'b' to the line 'g'. Afterwards, scrape off the skin between the two lips and remove the fat, then administer what was mentioned about stitching and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If, however, you do not complete the incision as required, because of the restlessness of the patient or because of bleeding: then fill the wound with a plaster soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it until it consumes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 On the perforation of an abscess, which happens under Titillicus (a type of swelling).
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These ulcers occurring under Titillico, are of the species of hard worms containing cysts, and among them are those containing moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Those containing moistures should be cut open by lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g. Therefore, when everything within the ulcer is evacuated with pus, then fill it up with old cloth and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the cloth, and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the ulcer is of the kind of hard worms called noduli Strophulae, then cut it as we said in the section on Strophulae equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then administer cautery to it, as we said in what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 [Section on surgery for ulcers caused by an artery or vein]
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it heals, a boil frequently occurs there; and similarly, a boil and swelling occur in veins as well.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is recognized that a boil and swelling are due to an artery or vein are as follows: because when a boil is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press on the boil with your fingers, you feel as if there is grating.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is due to a vein is round in the visible body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And an incision over this boil is a mistake, and especially in the area of the armpits, the groins, the neck, and in many places on the body; and it is very dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, it must be avoided to cut it with a knife and what is also in the extremities or the head, it must be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore, for that which is due to the swelling of an artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, afterwards the artery; and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a probe under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread at two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then puncture the place between the two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the boil is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards care for it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the boil is due to a vein incision, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the boil with the skin as possible.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert the point and hold it at the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and there should be a double thread within it until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then bind the ulcer with a good ligature; as I have told you before, in the ligature of the vein, with two parts and two ends threaded.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you fear that the thread may be drawn out, then insert another needle with a new thread under the entire ulcer at the incision; press and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the ulcer in the middle until it comes out what is inside; then cut off the surplus skin and release what is bound from that.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place a poultice upon it (the ulcer) which you immersed in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer the treatment, which is made with lints and oils, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 Chapter on the ulcer that occurs from a twist of the nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L (the letter 'L' stands for Latin word "ulcus" which means ulcer).
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As it happens with an apostema in an Artery and a Vein, similarly it happens with an apostema in Nerves: what happens to them is due to a blow, or it is due to excessive labor, and similar causes: and it occurs most often in places of joints, or heel, and in every place where the joints are moving: and it is a heavy abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is found in several dispositions without pain: and when it is tightened with violence, one feels weak like in a fainting spell.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the abscess is not accumulated deep within the body, on the contrary, it is under the skin, and itself moves to every part, and does not go towards the front, or before, nor to the rear towards the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 What therefore is in the joints, it should not be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps it may happen due to constriction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 In that which is from them in the head, or in the forehead, pierce the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If therefore the abscess is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then hang it up with a hook and scrape it: then remove it, and dress the wound with suture: take care of it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 [Section on the cutting of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.]
Caput LI.	 Chapter L (Roman numeral).
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Sometimes several people have frequent abscesses in their bellies and in the other parts of their bodies, which are called "Fungalia", similar to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Their root is delicate, and its head is coarse, and their lips are turned inside out.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 It is small from them: it is what becomes very large from them.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man, and within his belly were two things which were more like certain mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white, with fine roots, and their lips turned inside out, and they opened, and moisture flowed from them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I therefore cut it and found that one weighed about X and VIII ounces, and the other about VI ounces. And the operation in cutting them is to consider then if he is weak and moist, and the mushroom white, moist, fine-rooted: then cut him with a wide spatula, and be careful to have cauteries present with you in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For often much blood is expelled during his section: therefore beware if blood conquers you, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see him weak, fearful and afraid of the cut with iron, then take a thread made of lead correctly, and tie it with it to athelul (a kind of ointment or paste): its method is as we have said, and leave him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add in the stringing of lead (cautery).
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to string lead, whenever it presses on the mushroom, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the mushroom is large-rooted, then there is some fear and dread in cutting it, especially as it is within the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 Nevertheless, it is possible to cut its middle part.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize him so that he does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of him until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And be careful not to cut a mushroom of dark color, with few senses, foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I will come back after this reminder about Cancer.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 On the treatment of hernia of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	 In omnibus quidem operationibus que sunt necessaria in curanda omni morpho, ut aperiatur purgatur aut cauterizetur aut sicut est in alis, est necessarium ut habeamus eiusmodi instrumenta que ad operandum possunt etiam si non fuerint usitata. Et in hoc capitulo erunt nomina instrumentorum, quibus utilia sunt in omnibus operationibus; atque de cura eminentiae umbilici, sicut dicitur supra, scribetur breviter, ut pateat ad eam operandum qui hoc libello non familiaris erit.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A swelling of the umbilicus arises for various reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 It may arise from ruptures of the liver, which is above the abdomen; and out comes pus, or the intestines, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 It may also arise from blood flowing from a vein, or an artery, as was mentioned earlier.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 It may also arise from obstruction of wind in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a rupture of the liver, and the release of pus; then its color is similar to that of an abscess; it is soft, painless; and appears in a different position.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the passage of the intestines; then its position, as we have said, is of more violent difference.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound; and it is greatly enlarged at the entrance of the bath, and has intense pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture, it is soft; then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor can it be compressed, nor does it increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs appears an abscess turning black from the edge.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to rotten flesh; then the abscess is large, hard, and firm, and it pusifies according to a certain quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 But if it is due to wind; then when touched, it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation in it is, that you consider then, if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or wind; then it is necessary to prevent its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses due to an artery or vein occur.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to an intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you command the patient to hold his breath and stand extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark with the hot iron around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Afterwards command him to lie down on his back upon your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then circle with a wide spatula around the navel over the place you have marked with the hot iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle of the incision upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then tie him around with a strong thread or a silken cord and let the knot be that of a surgeon's knot.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Afterwards open the extended incision above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you find it already caught by the ligament: then extract the hernia and insert your index finger into it and push the intestine towards the inner abdomen; and if you find a hernia sac, then take it with the hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If, however, it is an artery or vein opposite to you: then circle it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Afterwards return to your work.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert them into two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circle you made around the tumor in the shape of a cross, causing them to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then tie the tumor in four places on the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and let the rotten flesh extend; and it will fall by itself or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards take care of him with whatever is necessary from the ointments until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is from a swollen flesh in him or from moisture: then hollow out the tumor as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And extract blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of it along with the place where it is solidified.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Chapter on Cancer Care.
Caput LIII.	 Title LXXXIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have said about the species of Cancer in division and the way for its treatment with medications; and beware of it when treating it with iron, lest it be injured; we have said that Cancer is generated in the matrix, and that caution is needed in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated; such as Cancer which is in breasts or hips and similar limbs, to extract all of its parts especially when it is just beginning to grow small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it has grown old and is large, do not approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I myself was unable to heal anyone from that; nor have I seen another before me who has achieved this.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it when it is located as we have said, is to precede and loosen the sick person from black cholera several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then if you find it with an obvious plentitude (of blood), perform phlebotomy on it.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the sick person with a preparation in which the operation takes place.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then insert the hooks that are suitable for Cancer into it (the abscess).
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out the entire thing from all sides with skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and allow the blood to flow, do not cut or remove it quickly, rather press the places, and clean away the coagulated blood with your hand or if possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the flow of coagulated blood from an incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 Paragraph on treating Hydrophobia (rabies).
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We now narrate on the division of types of Hydropsis, and how accumulation of water occurs; and signs of all species, and treatment of it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is cured with iron, is only the type of ascites alone; it does not come into contact with iron of the type tympanitis; neither deeply with the type hyposarcae, for it is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 If you have already been treated for this type of hydropsis, tympanitis with medicines and it did not help; then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if the sick person has already become weakened, or there is another illness along with hydropsis; such as if it is accompanied by cough, loose bowels, and similar ones; then beware not to treat him with iron; for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see a person who is overflowing with strength and there is no illness other than hydropsis; and it is not a child, nor an old person; then the method of operation in him is that you lift up the sick person standing before your hands, and the assistant follows behind him and presses his abdomen with his hand forcing water down to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a thorny sponge in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it be of two pointed parts, long, and having sharp tips like a sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 Nevertheless, there should be something of shortness in it gradually, so that it does not penetrate as far during the operation up to the intestine and harm it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydrops is generated from the intestines; then it must be pulled out with a section from the navel by a length of three fingers below towards the lower part above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the hydrops is generated due to liver disease; then your incision should be from the navel by three fingers on the left side.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 If its generation is due to the spleen, then let there be a section on the right side: and it is not necessary also that there should be a section on the side above which the sick person lies, so that superfluities do not run to the weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then perforate the skin entirely with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert into that incision, and slide your hand with the spatula under the skin, as if you were peeling it; let the quantity peeled off be the size of a nail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then perforate the peel (sifac) until the spatula reaches the empty place; and that is the watery place.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it (the splenic tumor), and insert into the opening an instrument of this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 It is like a cannula; it is made of silver, brass or copper, lead, cleaned and polished: to its lower part there is a small hole, and on the sides there are three holes, two on one side and one on the other; its end is cut in the manner of a reed incision, as you see; at the upper end of it there is a loop.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument; therefore draw off from the water a quantity halfway.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you draw off more than necessary from it, perhaps the sick person will die by resolution of his animal spirit; or he may have a fainting fit which is approaching death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But draw off from it according to its potency, and according to the signs that the sick person's condition gives you by his pulse and the quality of it.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it is immediately retained due to the skin which retains the opening that is above the peel (sifac); about which I told you to perforate it in that way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then apply the instrument on the second day if you see the patient can endure it: also extract a small amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Use it for a few days without fear and guard yourself against error until there remains in the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient and release much water from it, then take care of him with hot sand burial, much sweating in a bath and sun, and wait for thirst: and take care of him with the most powerful medicines until he is cured: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and liver, after the extraction of water: as I have told you in that which preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 On the care of infants who are born in places where their urinary passages have not been pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When someone gives birth to an infant from his mother's womb and the head is not pierced, or the opening is narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one must immediately pierce it with a very sharp spatula in this manner:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a slender nail made of lead into the hole and tie it; and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When he wants to emit urine, remove it (the nail) and mix (it with something).
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then bring it back.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place lead (or a similar substance), it is now possible that the urine which flows over the area, does not allow the hole to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 He whose hole is narrowed (or constricted), is treated with lead (or a similar substance) for many days until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those who have the hole in an incorrect location are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 This is because from those who are born, the hole is at the end of the spine: therefore he cannot mix (it with something) towards the front, until he lifts the spine with his hand to the upper regions.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 It is not generation (for him), because the semen cannot reach the womb in the correct way; and it is a very foul sickness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 The method of treatment in this case is for the sick person to lie down on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the spine of his head with your left hand to a very strong extension, and cut the head of the spine from its place near the priapium (a term referring to an abnormal enlargement or prolongation of the penis) with a sharp knife or chisel: as is the incision of a reed, or like you root something, so that the middle comes out similar to the head of the spine: and for the hole to fall in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware during your operation from blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 This often happens (or can happen).
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore oppose him with something that cuts blood and take care of the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Section on problems concerning the foreskin (or prepuce) and the head of the penis, and rotting, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	 Head LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These Albathers frequently occur in the vein, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from it one is malignant, and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Do not malignant one suspend with a fine hook and cut it off, until you clean it all.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place on it a basin immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it yourself afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Albather is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary that you administer cautery after its incision and its ligation.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If, however, the Albather is in the foreskin of a captive man, not circumcised, and part of it is within the foreskin, and part of it is outside: then you must remove the Albather that is inside first, until it consolidates, then care for it externally; because when you care for it at the same time, the foreskin will not heal unless it protrudes.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And now they also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin becomes black and rotten.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out everything that has become blackened, and what will rot, or is already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then line it over with honey that has been beaten with flour of quince pits and sieved grains of crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If, however, there is bleeding, then administer cautery with a lunar cautery in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 Because cautery is helpful for two conditions at the same time, namely bleeding and wound when it is ruptured.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the vein is corrupted and destroyed entirely within an hour: then it is necessary that you insert a cannula made of lead into the meat of the penis to mix weak wine over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In the actual adherence of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adherence does not occur except in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required for it: and sometimes adherence occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore, it is necessary to excoriate (or scrape) it with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves, and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to determine exactly (the adhered tissue), then it is necessary to scrape something from the head of the penis and the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Since the foreskin, when it is thin, may be easily pierced due to its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth which has already been soaked in cold water, to prevent them from adhering again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is to be treated with a styptic until it becomes firm.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Chapter on the cleansing of infants and the treatment of mistakes occurring in them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not the solution to continuity, as are other wounds: but since it comes from our operation, by our will, and its use is for boys specifically, it is necessary that we mark a better outcome and an easier way leading to health in it.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 Since I have found the majority of craftsmen and phlebotomists to use cleansing, by circumcising with a new knife and with tweezers: they use alfecatum (a type of bandage) and ligature with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And I myself have already tested all those methods, and I found no better cleansing with scissors, and with suture with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because, in the cleansing with scissors, skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the foreskin has two layers of skin: perhaps the outer skin is cut and the inner layer tears: therefore one is forced to make another incision, and pain will follow.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the cleansing that is done through the alfecat, that is, by hand (digital method), which tailors use, it is not securely cut at the extremity of the male member because perhaps it enters the opening of it.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However, with the cleansing by nail, perhaps iron comes out and ruins your operation; and the skin of a child is short by nature, and often this occurs such that it does not need cleaning; and I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 The cleansing with scissors and suture with thread has proven good to me; because scissors are proportionate to the incision; therefore the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Therefore when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and compression is made in a similar shape, holding the skin with a rod from all sides, so that no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of your operation is that you should make a child, especially if it is one who understands a little, aware that you do not do this, except that you tie thread on his rod only; and leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him happy and rejoice in every way possible for you from the fact that he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands at the right height, and he should not be sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor anything about the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand to its shaft, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the shaft emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then clean it thoroughly from whatever dirt accumulates upon it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then bind the sealed place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then tie below it a lesser bandage secondly.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower bandage securely, and cut between two bandages.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then raise the skin quickly upwards, and extract the head of the shaft.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better) and sprinkle powder on top; and upon the powder place a cloth in which an egg yolk boiled in rose water has been beaten up with fresh olive oil; and leave it upon this until another day; and take care of it with other treatment, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the forceps for cleaning is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Let the two ends be blunt and rounded, so that the branch of the nail does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 But if the error occurs during cleaning, it is because perhaps the inner skin escapes completely or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, before making the incision, stretch it out with your fingernail from your hour and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a tweezers and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If three days have passed and there remains something inflated under the shaft, then leave it until the abscess becomes warm and scabs over; remove the scab with ease, and cut it according to your preparation; beware of the head of the shaft.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 That will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Apply that with it, which consolidates the wound from the powders that we have mentioned in the treatise on powders: and if it cuts through the skin beyond measure, and goes into deeper layers, it does not harm him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, apply that with it until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Chapter on the extraction of a retained worm in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by a blockage made from stone, frozen blood, pus, flesh born, and similar things from what we mentioned in the methods of treatment division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 If the urine is not released and you see that its retention is due to a stone already present in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for the patient to be weakened by being bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then place his feet on his back, and let him stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and have him contract his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is pressed towards expulsion of the stone, urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it is not released as previously mentioned, and the patient is strong against the weak: then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose form is S. It should be made of silver, subtle, soft, concave like the reed of a bird's quill in delicacy and radius, long like the palm of one hand and a half: to which a fine cannula should be attached at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of exit of urine through it is to take a doubled thread, tie a piece of flax or cotton, good binding at its end: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is any excess flax, but introduce into the cannula forcefully, like pulling.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and white egg: and make the patient sit on a chair, and warm the bladder, and his member with moist oils and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the penis gently until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then double it from the upper part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe inside it until it reaches the Bladder, and feel that it has already reached the empty place: and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage, through which it goes, is where there is a twist.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then stretch out the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For the vine follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and let the vine run through the urine way: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder empties, and the sick person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Section on the quality of clysterizing the bladder with a Cylinder (Clepsydra).
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When a ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is coagulated in it and there is a desire for water and medicines to distill into it: then let it be done with an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And there are three openings in it, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And there should be a concave place where that which drives it is, according to the quantity that is needed without addition, until when something is pulled out with it, it is attracted by humidities; and when it is driven, along with it, it is expelled to a distance: this is how the clepshydra works, from which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore, when the desire is to project moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepshydra into the moisture and pull out with it what drives it towards the upper part; for moisture is attracted in the concavity of the clepshydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then introduce its end into a cane, as we have said in a syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then drive the moisture with what drives it; for that moisture quickly reaches the bladder, so that one feels unwell.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a subtle clyster for irrigating the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Let it be made of silver or gold: whose head is higher like a small vial, and under it there should be a cavity in which a ligature falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and put moisture into it, with which you want to clysterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it with a strong ligature between two cavities using double thread, and heat the moisture slightly over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then introduce the extremity of the clyster into the rod, afterwards press your hand upon the bladder with a suitable wetness for the ligature until the weak one feels, that this moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If however, the bladder is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment and make from it a circle and pierce it through from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert the thread into those holes as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather the circle, as it is gathered with a thong; when you place within it what you wish from moisture, oil and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it in the instrument; and make it like you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Stones.
Caput LX.	 Chapter Sixty.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have said about the types of stones, and their treatment with medications; and we distinguished between the stone generated in kidneys, bladder, and its entirety; and we spoke about the stone that is operated on by hand and section; and it is a stone generated properly in the bladder; and he who is strangled by a rod; and I am telling you this with clear explanation and abridgment.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder like water in its subtlety; and it appears in it white sand, and the weak one scratches his rod, and struggles with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it rises up, and exits along with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of boys is easy until they have reached fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 It is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 In youth it is moderate, that is to say, between the two: and that of which the Stone (crystal) is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is smaller, the treatment is contrary to it.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we come to the cure, it is first necessary that we clean the sick one with an enema, which draws out all the dung that is in his bowels; for sometimes it prevents the discovery of the Stone (crystal) during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick one should be taken with his feet, shaken, and moved to lower parts; so that the Stone (crystal) descends into the deep bladder or jumps from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit with his hands in your hands, and his hands should be under his loins, so that the bladder becomes entirely lowered towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine (search) him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you feel the Stone (crystal) in a space, then immediately approach it with an incision.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall under your touch completely, then it is necessary that you clean the index finger with oil from the left hand if the sick one is a child; or the middle finger if the sick one is an adult, and insert it into his anus and search for the Stone (crystal), until it stands under your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the exterior against the place where you wish to make an incision; and command the assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to lift the testicles with his right hand towards the upper parts; and with the other hand, remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part from where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a probang (Spatula) shaped as follows.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 Then find the place between anus and testicles, not in the middle but to the left side: and the incision should be above the stone, and your finger should be in the anus: and make a transverse incision, so that the incision is wide externally and narrow internally, according to the amount that the exit of the stone from it should not be larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps the finger which is in the anus presses the stone at the incision and comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are its angles and corners, which makes its exit difficult due to this reason.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is soft, like a gland, and round; and the exit of it is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore to the one who has corners and edges, add in the fissure (crack or cleft).
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out in this way, then one should apply pressure on top of it; or tie over it properly with a cord whose tip is like the moon, which presses upon the stone and does not slip away from it; or to introduce an instrument beneath it with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 But if you cannot apply pressure on it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something stops you due to blood, cut it with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if the stone is larger than one, then first push a large one towards the bladder (vesica).
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Afterwards push a small one after that; and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut on top of it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because it happens to the sick one of the two things, either death or a constant flow of urine; because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 Administer the purgation until it goes out; or break the opening with forceps until you draw it piecemeal.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation, fill the wound with tar, aloes, and dragon's blood; tie it up, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil or wine, or rose-oil, and cold water; to let the abscess settle down warmly.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the sick person on his neck, and do not loosen the binding until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you loosen it (the binding), anoint the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with the unguent daphne, and the unguent basilicum, until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If, however, an abscess hot and corrosive occurs in the wound; such as if blood congeals in the bladder and urine is prevented from it; and this is known by the expulsion of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore insert your finger into the wound and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and its rotting.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply any kind of remedy that agrees with it in healing, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And it is necessary during the entire course of treatment, to tie together both hips and bind them with a cause for the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it is in the urethra and it is pounded there and the urine outlet is prevented; then care for him with what I have said before reaching the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For many times you will be excused from the incision in this treatment, for I have already proved it (the above remedy).
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 The instrument is to receive a Perforator from iron alferic, whose shape is triangular at the end, sharp and fixed into wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take thread, and tie it with a rod under a stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then introduce the perforating iron into the rod with ease until the Perforator reaches the same stone; and rotate the Perforator with your hand on the said stone gradually; and you shall exert force to make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Indeed, urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 It is indeed broken and it comes out with the urine, and the ill one gets healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If however this treatment is not prepared for you for some reason that prevents it, then tie thread under the stone, and another thread on top of the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut across the rod on the stone between two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then draw it out.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards, loosen the ligature and clean off the frozen blood which is made in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And the thread under the stone is not necessary unless to prevent its return to the bladder; and another thread on top is not necessary except that when the thread below is removed after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for you to lift the skin above when tying the upper thread so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 A stone is seldom generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If however a stone happens to any of them, then the treatment is difficult and forbidden because of many modes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is: that perhaps a woman is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second one is, because you do not find a woman who discloses herself to the doctor when she is chaste or married.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, because you do not find a woman well versed in this art, especially the operation with her hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And fourthly, distance from the place of the stone (stone here refers to a gallstone); hence it requires deep incision, and this entails fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity demands it (the operation), then you must take a female doctor who is well-versed; she is seldom found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 But if you exclude this (female doctor), then seek a chaste and skillful doctor, who is present; a well-informed woman obstetrician skilled in women's matters or a woman knowledgeable in the art; make her present, especially instructing her to do everything as she examines the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, it is to examine if a woman is a virgin: then you should insert your finger into her anus and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If you find the stone, grasp it with your finger and then instruct the obstetrician to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and examine the stone after she places her left hand on the bladder and presses it gently.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If the stone is found, then you should move it gently from the bladder opening to lower areas with utmost care until it reaches the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then cut across it at the midpoint of the bladder near the root of the hip, from whatever side you wish to prepare him, and he will feel the stone in that area; his finger should not be removed from the stone while gripping it, pressing down on it; the incision should initially be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then insert a rod over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels a stone, then let him add to the cut according to a proportional amount that the stone is expelled from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that the shapes of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For these there is one small, large, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know its shape so that it may be indicated to you on that which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood overcomes you, then let add in the place zegi crushed and hold it for an hour until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and do, that you prepare yourself with those instruments which I have said for extracting a stone in men, so that you can assist with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood overcomes you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then place powder on the spot, and bind it with thread fitting for ligature; do not move it; and let the stone remain, and do not extract it yourself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Chapter on cutting a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery hernia is not something other than an accumulation of moisture within the albo sac, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg; and it is called the albo sac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is within its own panniculus that nature has prepared for itself in the part of the egg, until it seems to be; which is another egg and is the skin of the testicle between the albo sac that we said; and this does not happen often.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed the generation of this branch is due to a weakness that happens in testicles; therefore, this material is discharged towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens due to striking upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For its color is either sloping towards citrinitas (yellowish), or red like blood, or foul-smelling, black, or watery white; and the one that is more is this one.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which it is known where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the scrotal white part that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round and somewhat shorter than the shape of an owl's eye; and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture is in the scrotum proper to itself, then the abscess is round with a part like an owl's eye; and therefore the man bursts because it is another egg (ovum).
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the scrotal white part, then it falls under the sense (of touch).
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When therefore the power of perception desires to know the color of the moisture, then experiment on the color of the moisture in an abscess with a probe inserted, whose shape was previously mentioned.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which comes out following the probe, judge about what is between it (the abscess and the probe).
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When therefore we come to the treatment with iron (surgery), then it is necessary that you command the sick man, if possible for him, to have his body bled; and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies on his back on a low bed, and place many cloths beneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on his left side, and command the assistant to sit on his right, who will extend his leg (the sick man's) to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the flank of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad probe, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, almost up to the scrotal bone; and make the incision according to the line of equal length that divides the skin of the testicles, until you reach the white albugo encompassing it; and scrape it and observe, or be careful not to cut it; and let your scraping be on the part that hangs down more with the egg; and examine carefully with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Perform a wide water expulsion on the albugo (the white part of the testicle), and remove all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two parts of the scrotum with your fingers, and pull down the albugo to the upper part, without touching the skin surrounding the testicles; and cut the albugo as you can in any way, either completely or partially, particularly on its delicate side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not examine and search carefully, there is no certainty that the water will not return during the incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 But if an egg comes out from its shell externally during your operation hour: then when you finish the incision of the albugo, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then bring together the two parts of the scrotal skin with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as you would any other wound, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find a corrupted egg from any blackness, then it is necessary to tie the containers that are suspended, fearing bleeding.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle with its spermatic cord, and remove the egg; then take care of it as we said earlier.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If the water is collected in two parts, then you know that there are two branches; therefore, cut the other part equally as you did on the other side.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it seems to you that the operation should be one, then do so; then remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 Insert a wet wool thread into the incisions, or in rose oil: and place another wool on the outside which you have immersed in wine and oil, and expand it over two testicles, and look inside the abdomen: and put double cloths on top, they are poultices: and tie them above with a ligament that has six knots.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two cloths are taken and sweated, and filled with carminative, according to this shape: and the ends which are pressed should be wrapped with wet wool or linen: and they will be joined with a ligature in the loins: and one end will take hold of the anus up to the back, and the second will take hold at the part of the neck: and two ends lower down will be on the two thighs, and two other ends will be on the two groins: and the entire ligature will be joined in the loins.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes this ramus is artificially treated with cautery in place of the incision with iron: and it is that you should take a subtle cautery scalpel, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is lit, as we have said: until the white silicone containing water is revealed: then take the cautery, according to this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It resembles Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce that with it and let it burn until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then stretch that with forceps, and scrape it with a fine-pointed cautery that has been lit, and cut into it as much as possible for you, until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful not to let the fire touch the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is healthier, more distant from bleeding, and better than an operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If it causes a counteraction to you at the time of the section or at the time of the cautery for an abscess, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you treat what causes the counteraction to you from that with the appropriate treatment, according to what was previously mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If the patient is weak and fearful, and does not await this operation due to its horrible nature: then administer a purgative as I have previously said, and it is so.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are informed by what was previously said about the meaning of a watery discharge from the vagina: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then purge the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and place the purgation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until it is cured by water entirely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a hot compress on the spot and bind it, and let him remain until the remaining water is cured: then treat him until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If the counteraction is to the discharge of water at the time when you purge it, and this is not due to any other reason, except that a white mass obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather or an instrument with which water from hydropic sores is extracted, whose form was previously mentioned: or add in the operation of the wound a little more.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water will return and accumulate after six months, approximately.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it accumulates, then it should be purged in the same manner, and the patient shall pass his days thus.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Chapter on the treatment of fleshy ramics.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that, in a section over this Raimic, it leads to danger in many dispositions due to fear.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems wise to me to release it from there.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am remembering the operation and the appearance of the abscess in it.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore, I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies, from which testicles are composed; and this happens due to many causes.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an excessive sharpness or acuteness that flows toward the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and the abscess is severe.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and no sensation is felt in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens from the knotting and swelling of the arteries, and inflation of them; as has already been remembered; or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore, what is from it due to the swelling of the arteries can be known through the position of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And one should not touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 But what happens from the inflation of veins does not scatter anything at the point of compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that a section can be made over this appearance and over the remaining flesh; and it is for the sake of cutting the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward and extract it along with a white piece of silk; and release the suspenders from the testicles, and tie the testicles; and cut the suspenders after you have released them from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the egg is consolidated with those born tissues, then it should be drawn out and cut.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 If there is an adherence between something from a syphon or within the vessel: then it is necessary to release the entire adherence and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If there is a birth of flesh in the place of an adherence that is behind it: then it is necessary to cut all of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool immersed in rose oil and wine; afterwards take care of it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the treatment of branches, which is related to vines.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIIII (62nd).
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 A pile is a pouch-like abscess similar to a bunch of grapes with the consistency of testicles; it becomes difficult for movement and exercise, and walking, especially for the sick.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness there is fear due to the memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 However, it is necessary to say that the operation on it should be done as the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore I say that you must make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then pull down the suspender of the testicles to the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, and hold nearby vessels with another person; and that person should stretch it out with a forceful extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then cut with a wide sharp crosswise incision on the vessels until they are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape it off from all sides, as I have told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Afterwards, place a pointed awl with double thread in them, and tie it at the first places where vines occur; and tie it again at the last of those.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it at the middle crosswise along its length of the body, and remove what collects from putrid and foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Care for the wound with treatment of other wounds where the power to generate pus exists, so that vessels which nourish one testicle fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If it happens that the vine is in all vessels, then they must be removed for this reason: lest the testicles be deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and decay or burn, and not be useful with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the care of intestinal reeds.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The outflow of this reed is from the cut that happens in the siphon stretched over the abdomen in the inguinal part of the liver.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do intestines come out through that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the siphon or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two kinds of ruptures occur from various causes: either by striking, jumping, shouting, lifting heavy objects or similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign is when it is from the extension of the siphon.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly: it is an abscess equal to the turned-over hollow: because the siphon compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the sign of it when it is from a cut in the siphon, because it causes a sudden severe pain at its origin: and it is an abscess different, appearing under the skin near to: and that is due to the outflow of the intestine, and its course to the exterior through the siphon.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with a worm in the intestine: and this is called the intestinal reed, and worm: and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes feces run into the intestine and are held there; it is a danger to the sick for it brings about painful conditions, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of this disease with iron there is fear; therefore caution must be taken to avoid accidents during it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of operation is to command the sick person to reduce their intestine with their own hand into the hollow within themselves, if they obey the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies on his back upon his neck between your hands and elevate his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upward and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then tie the two lips of the incision with sutures, as many as you need to open the incision with them; and the incision should be in accordance with the size that can allow the egg to come out.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotum and what is beneath the skin of the testicles until the scrotum becomes white all over; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, in that part between the scrotum and the albumen under the skin of the egg, and through it, without being attached to the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then press the skin of the testicles with your right hand while at the same time extending the scrotal albumen upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with the scrotum to the part of the incision; and command the attendant to extend the egg upward, and you solve the attachment that is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And examine with your fingers if there is nothing in the scrotum wrapped in hard, rolled-up intestine.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 But if you find something from it; then push it downwards into the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a probe with a thick thread, made from linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last scrotum, that is, the tunica, which follows the skin of the testicles after section; then cut off the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then compose some of them on top of others in the form of a cross; and bind with it the alsifach, of which we have spoken, since it is a strong ligament under the skin of the testicles, until it cannot let any of the fluids that nourish them pass through to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place again the ligament beyond the first ligament, at least two fingers away.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments, let out from the scrotum, what is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity of size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely according to roundness, and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut in the lower part of the scrotal skin along which blood and pus run, as we have told you in what was previously mentioned.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then administer wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and administer the ligament as we have told you.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes the scrotum of the testicles that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And let go of the ligament until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the case is slow to heal, then foment it with warm water; and place on it what we have said, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then take care of the wound with the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on Hydroceles (swellings filled with fluid).
Caput LXVI.	 Head, LXVI. (This is a Roman numeral for sixty-sixth, referring to the chapter on treating conditions related to the head.)
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this ramichia, I did not see anyone who dared to treat it with iron. (Ramichia is a term for a surgical instrument resembling forceps used in the nose or ear.)
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And the first ones said that it happens as we told in ramichia which is with wine. (The context suggests a discussion about a medical condition or treatment.)
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is to tie the vessels after section on it with ease below; then cut in the middle and treat lastly with what opens itself; until the vessels fall out; and cure the wound, as we said, until it heals. (The text seems to discuss a surgical procedure for treating a medical condition or injury.)
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Chapter on rupture that happens in groins. (Disruption refers to a sudden tear or separation of tissues, possibly a hernia in this context.)
Caput LXVII.	 Head, LXVII. (Refers to the sixty-seventh chapter, discussing conditions related to the head.)
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When rupture occurs in groins, as we said, and a location protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends towards the testicles; and if it does descend, it is insufficient and returns in all hours; but if prolonged with it, a split occurs in sifach until the intestines descend into sifach. (The text seems to discuss a hernia condition related to the groin.)
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this occurs from the extension of sifach, which is in the groins, as we said. (The context suggests a further discussion about hernia or related conditions.)
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 That is because sifach extends; then it softens, and the location is pushed out. (The text seems to discuss a medical condition or symptom related to the extension of sifach.)
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its treatment is with cautery, as its previous narrative said. (The context suggests a discussion about treating a medical condition or injury using cautery.)
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And it is sometimes treated with iron, in this manner; and there is, that the sick one lies on his back between your hands. (The text seems to discuss a surgical procedure for treating a medical condition or injury.)
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the location of rupture and protrusion with a width-wise incision, according to the size of three fingers. (The text appears to describe a surgical procedure for treating a hernia or related condition.)
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie the ligature and, what is beneath the skin, until the white sifach is exposed, which is beneath the skin following it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take the radium and place it on the projecting part of the sifach and press it to the depth of the intestines.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then cut out two protruding parts at the end of the radius from the sifach and sew them together with a stitch; then extract the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the sifach at all, nor draw out the yolk, nor anything else as I had told you in the treatment of the intestine's branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat that with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you make an incision, clean it and restore the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For sifach contracts and no protrusion is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautery is better here, since it is closer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on the softening of the scrotum skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The skin of the scrotum is often softened in some men, which causes the flesh between them to become soft, and it becomes an unpleasant sight.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for him who asks about the treatment of this to make the patient lie down on his back and make an incision through all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then sew together the two folds with a stitch; and if you wish, trim off the excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches, or a strong stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then make an incision between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then treat this with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	 Chapter on castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Head LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 You should know that castration is forbidden by our law: and therefore it would be permitted for me not to remember it in my book; and it is not necessary to remember it except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is asked about it: and so that he may know the treatment for him to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the second reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our use through it, such as rams, hirsute swine, and cats, and similar ones among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore, that castration is done according to two modes.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by fissure and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 But in that which is done by attrition, the way of the operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water until his testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and no longer appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 But in castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of his testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then bind the suspensorium, and cut through everything above an egg with one section until when two eggs come out; then cut those after you have peeled it, and do not leave anything on them except a little sifaket (substance) which is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something from the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then cure the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Chapter on the care of Hermaphroditus in two modes.
Caput LXX.	 Head LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphroditus is of men according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is that it appears in him what follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, in what is between two testicles, with a figure similar to the vagina of a woman, in which are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from it which is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is one species, and it is a vagina of a woman on top of the pubis like small testicles of a man, projecting towards the outside; one of which is like the male member known as Priapus, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of the three species, two from men, and one from women, is that you must cut into the flesh until the imprint flees.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then heal them with the remedies for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 However, in the second species of men, from which urine flows out, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and there is absolutely no cure for it.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on Incision of Warts and Protruding Skin in Women's Vaginas.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 A wart is perhaps added on top of a natural condition until it becomes ugly and the appearance is spoiled: and sometimes it grows so much in certain women that it expands like in men, and reaches intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, you must hold the excess wart with the hand or with a hook and cut it: and not at the extremity of the incision, especially in deep roots, so that there is no bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then heal the wart itself with the remedies for wounds until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 But flesh that has come out is the flesh that is born in the opening of the womb until it fills itself: and sometimes it comes out towards the outside like a tail; and for this reason some call the disease "caudad.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 It is necessary therefore that we cut it as we do with a tumor, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 On the treatment of an Alractic ulcer, which is not perforated in a woman.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The Alractic ulcer is when there is an unperforated boil on a woman or a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 The accidental one is from the preceding illness; and it itself arises either from flesh born attached, or from subcutaneous tissue, or from fat; and it arises either in the depth of the matrix (womb), or in its sides, or on top of it, or below it; and it forbids coitus and impregnation, parturition, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 Its recognition is through the examination of an obstetrician, if it appears that the swelling is near the opening (of the matrix).
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers or a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the swelling is from subcutaneous tissue and it is near two lips (of the matrix): then apply a hot iron, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And place small poultices on top of the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your thumbs of both hands together and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then stretch out the two lips with strength until the subcutaneous tissue is broken and the swelling opens up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take thread and dip it in oil, and place it on the spot; let the woman rub it daily so that the area does not become hard by another thing.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the subcutaneous tissue is thick and coarse: then it is necessary to cut it with a narrow-bladed leech-like leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the swelling is from flesh born attached: then suspend it with hooks and cut it; and have with you medicines that stop blood flow without bleeding, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with sheep's fat.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula made of lead, so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for some days; and apply linen cloth, then treat the rest with the usual care, until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes a birth of flesh from the matrix arises: it is therefore necessary that they be cut according to this manner: as long as there is no cancerous growth, for the cancerous matter in the matrix should not come into contact with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Section on the treatment of hemorrhoids, by Attehelil and Botheor for women.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Indeed, hemorrhoids are the opening of veins until much blood continuously flows from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids harden, they become warts; and I have already said what their types are, and their signs; now I will say here what receives treatment and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the matrix and not perceptible to touch, then no treatment with iron is given.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those on the opening of the matrix that can be felt are those that receive treatment.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then Attehelil extends himself with forceps or with rough cloth and cuts them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then he sprinkles powder over them near the flow of blood from one of the incision wounds without biting; like acacia, dragon's blood, pitch, and similar substances.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then he pushes his feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, rinds of pomegranates, and tannins and similar substances.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and apply it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If blood is cut out along with it, that's good; if not, make the back adhere to blisters and nipples, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and dip it in the juice of tar-thorn, or the juice of argolis, or the juice of elm bark, that is, alder, Pontic wine, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When an abscess becomes quiet, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albarth is red and resembles the heads of alhaasse, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, you should cut what appears from it, as I said in thehelil equally; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 Chapter on the Perforation of the Expelled Fetus that occurs in the Womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 In the womb, many kinds of abscesses occur, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati, that is, herpes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thelil, and warm abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I myself have already said all these diseases and their kinds, the signs of each one, and the cures for them in another division; it is necessary to say in this treatment about the warm abscess that occurs in the womb when it is from abscesses that collect pus, and we need to know how its opening with iron is done.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If the pain of the abscess is sharp at its beginning with striking and burning and fever; if it turns red on itself when applied to the sense; then do not rush with its perforation: and take care of it with what helps for maturation, until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which has two armrests, and she should lean back or recline on her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of her belly; and let her hips be spread apart, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a band appropriate for that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife shall sit on the woman's right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 The form comes to those who are in labor.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary when you are to administer this instrument that you make a deep incision with the rod in the woman's womb; so that what enters from the instrument is not deeper than the depth of the womb, and injures the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is too deep, then it is necessary that you place small pebbles on the surface of the depth of the womb; so as to prevent the entire entry of the instrument into the depth of the womb; and it is necessary that you place a loop, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side; and that you hold the instrument and turn the loop with the attendant until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears that the child is about to be born and touched with the hand, and it is soft and smooth; then it is necessary that you separate her herself from the head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When the pus is expelled, then it is necessary that you place linen soaked in rose oil or green oil with a certain stickiness on the wound; and place the linen, and remove the section from the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 Place a clean linen soaked in boiling wine vinegar over the womb and on the comb; and on top of that, place a clean cloth dipped in water in which mallow has been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it shall be treated after two days with an ointment suitable for that purpose, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix and wound are cleansed, so that it is purged with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily has been boiled, or long aristolochia: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden internally within the matrix, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, rather cure it with what was said above concerning division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Part Two: Teachings on Obstetrics, how to treat living fetuses that have exited in an unnatural manner.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the shape of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, the signs of this are as follows: when you see a woman pressing towards the lower regions, and desires to smell the air, and is swollen above her belly with childbirth, and hastens the exit of the fetus; then know that this birth is in its natural shape, and its outlet is over its head, and the afterbirth is accompanying it: either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then press down on her abdomen so that the fetus descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth also descends with it, and is cleaned from those superfluities by good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But if it is a birth other than this, it is unnatural, inadmissible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For sometimes the fetus comes out with its feet first, and its body goes out before its head, and one foot or hand; or a single hand or foot: or its head and one hand; or its belly: and perhaps it turns over onto its neck, and similar unnatural shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 It is necessary therefore for the Midwife (Obstetrician), to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and should beware of error and deception; and I am showing every figure from them, and how the intellect is in it, and this will be indicated by it, and it shall stand upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes out on top of its own exit, and it becomes strong upon the woman, and the delivery becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let the women hold her; and let her inhale steam from boiled fennel seeds, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife introduces a small spatula into her fingers, and she probes with it the cervix, and cuts it with her nails until what is inside runs out due to moisture; and press the womb of the woman until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary to use a female enema with fennel mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then order her after the enema, that she is compressed; and make her sneeze with snuff, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus come out first, then you must gently pull them back slowly.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat and raise her feet up; then hit the seat on the ground; and hold the woman so that she does not fall due to the impact.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies; then cut them and take out the rest of the fetus; and tie his hand with cloth, and take him out equally; for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The outcome [occurs] upon its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus exits upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards: then gradually turn it: afterwards straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 And when they [the legs] come out as far as the hips, then command it to be pressed and make her sneeze with pepper: for it will be born if God so desires.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we have said [described], then gradually bring the fetus back until you put it in its natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For it will then be born easily through that [exit].
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is prevented from coming out as we have said [described], then take some mallow root pulp, sesame oil and soluble gum: grind all of them together with good pounding in a mortar: then apply the mixture to the inside wall of the woman's womb and lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she sweats.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then make [something] of myrrh for her and place it upon it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When one hour has passed, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze: and hold her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the stomach gently with pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the feces will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 Exit birth over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out in this manner, then insert your hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back with her feet hanging down and she lies down on the bed and encloses her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently upon the stomach of hers.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then take out what is under her feet from the sheets until it is ready at the bottom.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the birth does not come out, then take her feet and shake them with strong shaking.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press what is above the hypocondrium gently until the birth comes up to higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hands and push the birth gradually: and command the woman to press until the birth comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 Exit birth hanging broadly from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 Insert your hand for reduction (reducing a dislocated joint or bone).
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If she cannot be reduced [back into place], then carry the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then lay her down on the bed and strike her legs violently.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then administer the ointment you have prepared from mucilages (a thick gelatinous substance obtained by boiling plant materials).
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she receives birth, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then study the reduction of the hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural figure: and make the woman sneeze, and command her to press herself until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The exit of the fetus is on its neck, with hands spread, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is equalized, then place it on the wound as I have said with oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command her to move it slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a stool and command her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command her to press it: and make her sneeze with cathartics.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The prepared fetus exits on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends through the mother's orifice in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is expelled due to moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus is hanging on its face and neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as needed; and command the woman to press herself several times; for it will exit easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The exit of twins or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 You should know that twins often give birth; and sometimes three or even four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 Nevertheless, it is unusual and rare.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 However, it is a thing outside of nature and they do not live long; and the afterbirth containing them, although multiplying, is one; and they are separated by the siphunx, which distinguishes between them tied at each one's navel.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And at times they come forth like a single fetus through the natural exit, easily: and they come forth through an inexpressible exit, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult at childbirth and reach what we mentioned in unnatural forms, then care for them as we have said: it should be done with a subtle probe and do what is done easily and slowly, and invent according to every form with the one who is being prepared by his natural ability leading towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes it is formed in the womb one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten: and already proven to me that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of which were formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this entire matter should be in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it will reach a similar one; therefore, let him oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 Chapter on the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 If you care for a dead fetus with what I said in the division of medicine and it does not come out, and you will have to operate using your hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is in good health and not with any accident from which her loss is feared, then the woman should lie on the bed on her back, and her head be inclined downward, and her legs elevated: and the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she may be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moisten the bone matrix with moist oils (such as) aloe emodin, fenugreek, and flax seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife should wet her hand with these oils and mucilages, then introduce it easily into the matrix (uterus).
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then she should seek a place where to fix the hooks for the child, and the areas that correspond to it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Then consider if the child is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or near the ribs, and below the hips.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If it is a descent upon its feet, then fix them on the chest and in the middle of the ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that she holds the hook with her right hand: and puts a thread on it between the fingers of the left hand: and introduces it easily, and fixes the hook in one of those places which we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty place (the fetus's head).
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then fix another or third hook in opposition to it, if needed: so that the contraction is equal and does not deviate to one side (to keep the fetus's head straight).
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then the extension should be extended equally, and not only in a straight line, but rather move to all parts, so that its exit is relieved: as it is done when pulling a tooth (to loosen it).
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it is necessary that the extension is softened in this place.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is retained from it, then the midwife should wet certain fingers with oil and insert them from that side to turn what is being retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks should be moved to a higher place: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If the hand comes out first, and it cannot be retracted because of its dislocation: then a cloth should be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then pull out the limb completely when it comes out, and cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow. Therefore, you should do this with one hand on the limb and with both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the head of the fetus is large or if it becomes dislocated during delivery, or water has accumulated around its head: then introduce a pointed and sharp instrument called Spatumile into the fingers, and pierce the head with it and drain the water; or tear it apart using an instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, if the fetus has a large head naturally, then separate it with algengematum; or pull it out with misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head comes out and becomes dislocated at the collarbone: then it is pierced until the moisture that is in the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it does not twist nor obey to come out: then cut the head as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If there is an abscess below the stomach, or if there is hydropisis in it: then pierce it until the moisture runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If the fetus is above its own feet, then drawing it out is easy, and guiding it to the bone of the matrix is simple.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it becomes dislocated in the abdomen or chest: then pull it out with the cloth you have wrapped around your hand; and pierce the abdomen or chest until what is inside runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the midwife shall introduce her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the cervix is open, then introduce the hand deeply into the cervix and seek the head with it, and draw it forth with the fingers up to the cervix: Then introduce a hook or hooks and draw it forth with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the cervix is contracted due to a hot abscess that has occurred there: then it is not necessary to labor over it, but rather to administer a solution of moist substances and oil: And to apply poultices: And sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, it may be equalized: then administer what was said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that cannot be done, it shall be cut into pieces and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it is necessary not to leave anything of the second part inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you have completed your operation, then administer what was said for hot abscesses that occur in the uterus.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, descend into waters of stibium and administer the remainder of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And I myself have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus: Then she conceived again over it, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 A long time passed and then an abscess occurred in her navel, which became swollen until it was open, and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called for her treatment, and treated her for a long time: but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 Then I placed over it some strong adhesive plasters: and the bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then some days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was amazed therefore, since there is no bone in the abdomen.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 So I thought, because the fetus were dead bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I asked therefore for a wound, and drew out many bones, the woman being in good condition: and she lived thus for a long time, and sent out little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I did not fix this foreign object here, unless because there is knowledge and assistance to that which the healing craftsman administers with his hand in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Chapter on the shapes of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Below is the shape of the Squeezer, by which books are made equal, as it has two windings at both ends of two wooden rods.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this winding should be finer than the squeezer: and it is made so, either of ivory or of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all the rods should be like two fingers: and each edge is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two rods are two additions of the same type of wood, which have already been fixed on both sides; whose length is half a palm and less, and width is like two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 These two instruments are inserted into the mouth of the matrix to open it when you rotate the two screws.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The shape of the screw that opens the matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another shape, similar to the former, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Make it from ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at the end of it there should be two protrusions as you see here above: and the length of each protrusion is about a palm: and the width of each one is, two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then have the woman sit on the bed, with her legs apart, opening what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two protrusions together into the matrix: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount by which you wish to open the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The shape of another screw, different from the one described by the ancients, is called "Impeller", it propels the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The shape of Almisdac, which crushes a large head, resembles forceps, with teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes long, like forceps with this shape, as you can see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The shape of Almisdac that crushes a small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The shape of the uncinus with one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The shape of the uncinus with two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The shape of forceps with saw-like teeth, by which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The form of Spatumilis has two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form of two expanded Spatumilium (instruments).
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are operated and the more numerous their forms are, and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker for its operation, and higher in people's esteem, because of its quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not despise any instrument from among them, but prepare it for yourself.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Indeed, the necessity of these (instruments) is beyond excuse.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the second extraction (removal of a foreign body).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII:
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you command the weak one to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with pepper and close her nose and your hand on her mouth.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it thus comes out (the Afterbirth), it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not (the Afterbirth comes out), then take the pot and pierce a hole in its cover; and place within it the herbs opening the womb, such as camomile, rue, anise, fennel, cassia wood, centaury: take all these herbs or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place the wick of the reed over the hole of the pot's cover and the other end inside the womb; and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze again, as we said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For indeed the Afterbirth will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If however it remains after this treatment and does not come out; then command the Midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or althea gum.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then she will insert her hand into the womb and search for the Afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When she finds it (the Afterbirth), then take it, and pull it out slowly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deeply in the womb, then insert your hand (as I have said before), until when she finds the Afterbirth, and pulls it out slowly according to the right direction, so that it does not fall out of the womb due to strong pull; rather it should be moved gently from side to side: then add more in accordance with the strength of the pull.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It will then obey and survive and come out from its attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If a bone in the matrix is dislocated, as we have already stated: treat it with stimulation (shaking), and with a medicament from an oil pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out with everything we have stated, then beware of overexerting yourself in the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 It is necessary that what comes out to the bone of the matrix from there should be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then, perform a cleansing with the four-drug ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For it will rot her after days, and it will dissolve and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it rots, raise the bad smell from her to her stomach and head, and damage the weakened part.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, fumigations suitable for that should be administered.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already tried fumigations of nasturtium and fig leaves.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during retention of the Second Stage and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make it like an alcamea flask or a jar: and place the wide end over the fire: the fumigation should be placed above plums: hold her with it until that fumigation is consumed: then another one can be repeated.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX (79).
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born, and the anuses of these children are not perforated, which the operator has already cauterized with a subtle probe (probe for opening the anus).
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife should pierce it with her finger; and if she cannot, she should pierce it with a spatula sharp; and let her be careful not to touch the muscle.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Place upon him a linen cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with unguent until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If you fear that it is choking, then put a lead cannula into the opening and leave it there for several days; remove it when the child wants to come out.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 Now it happens that anophelia (strangulated hernia) also occurs due to consolidation of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, that consolidation should be cut; then it should be treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodation (strangulated hernia) and grossness that occurs near the anus outdoors; or in a space of one part; and there is one fistula, or more than one.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When that nodation (strangulated hernia) becomes ancient, it is opened and watery moisture runs out from it, or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes they are penetrating fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, penetrating fistulas are recognized by the discharge that comes out with a straining, and by wind when an invalid uses straining; and perhaps worms come out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And there are fistulas when they penetrate into the space up to the bladder and up to the bowel.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are penetrating fistulas up to the juncture of the hip and up to the node of the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From that which is recognized as a penetrating fistula up to the anus, even if it is not a penetrating one, is when you insert your finger into the anus; and you insert a thin probe made of copper or iron into the fistula, if there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a twist [or bend] in it, then introduce into it a thin probe of lead or a horse's hair [bristle], until you feel the probe, or a hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it fully, nor does anything come out from the incision, nor is there any pus or worms as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating; therefore proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or the ureter: then its sign is the discharge of urine from it, and its stoppage by this means that the site should be closed with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 If it is penetrating to the junction of the hip or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches it if there is no twist to the bone; and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always discharges from it; and that no medicine helps in it, nor does it heal with a salve.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all fistulas that penetrate there is no cure at all; and the cure of them is torment and emptiness for him, to whom they are applied, from foolish physicians, upon whom they are formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, healing may be hoped for with a probe; according to what I tell you, and I have already proved: and it is as follows - the patient lies weak between your hands on his back; and both of his legs are raised up to the hips themselves; and the hips themselves are inclined towards the abdomen itself.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then introduce a probe of lead or of air if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If the patient feels it around the anus, then you must introduce your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If you feel that a thing has already pierced through your finger by itself and it is recognized, except that you feel something between your finger and the bone or flesh: then you shall know for sure that it penetrates; do not labor on it, because there is no healing in it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that flesh heals in some people and the remedy, by which help is expected, is, to burn cautery with a fine tip according to the width of the fistula, as was said before, and to introduce it into the fistula until it reaches the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then do this twice or three times until you know that all the added flesh filtering similar to chicken feather quill has been burnt.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then wrap it with linen in butter until the burned flesh comes out; then take care of it with ointments producing and consolidating flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If the thing comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or bone between it and the thing: and you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula and you go on cutting with the thing in the fistula until the section reaches the end of the thing, and the thing is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean the filtering flesh similar to chicken feather quill, so that nothing remains of it.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood beats you and dissolves the filtering flesh between you and your operation, then it is better that you burn it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because cautery with fire brings about good conditions, burning of the added flesh, removal of blood, and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then, care it with bandages rolled in butter or boiled cabbages until the place releases pus, and those burned flesh exudes into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then care for the wound with hardening ointments, those producing hard flesh; there are remedies that contain styptic and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is restored, then it heals; do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If, however, the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and extends beyond the body's excess; then insert your finger into the anus and investigate it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If therefore you feel a tentative sensation between yourself and her, and there is a membrane of sheepskin or flesh that is close to penetration; then there is no operation on it except by way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 Because it is administered in one of three ways: either to cauterize it itself, as we have said; or to excise it until you reach the hollow of it, so that you can insert bandages and cure it from close by.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed too much with the excision so as not to cut the muscle containing the anus and cause an unfortunate outcome of evacuation without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for it with what I have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal; or you elongate the membrane itself and clean it when you cut it up to the anus as we have said, either with the sensation of touch, or with another sharp tool at the end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then clean the fleshy parts filtered during excision until you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with excision and the upper opening where it is consolidated; the fistula remains open in the internal part of the anus, and it will be easier for evacuation.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a fistula drains in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula, which is on the side of the anus near the body surface with skin and anus margin; then take a probe with a perforated tip, similar to an alembic point, that is, prepared from calfskin, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a rolled thread of five strings, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with thread into the fistula until it reaches its hollow.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it penetrates the anus margin internally, then pull out the thread from that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus and draw out the end of the thread, and join both ends together; and tie each end separately, and let it stay for one or two days; and the more the thread sinks into the flesh, tie it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls off and drops away; then take care of the wound until it heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating; then make it penetrate by whatever means you can prepare, except if it is deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For indeed, it is not for you to do this because of the arm so that you may not cut it yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do with it as we said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The shape of a spatula with a spiked tip used to open the fistula, whose sharpness is very acute, and the other part is not acute so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 Chapter on the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood runs after cutting them; and care for fissures (anal cracks).
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Hemorrhoids are of two types.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Within the anus are found, resembling bladders or charcoal, or even like the seeds of grapes.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 Some are small and others large. Blood is always flowing from them, and there is one [source of bleeding], and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 They are outside the anus and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus, are for the most part dry, from which citron water flows or a little blood in a continuous course; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment of that which is within the anus is to instruct the patient to fast: it is expressed and squeezed out until it appears at the anus for you [to see].
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, hold them with tweezers or keep them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they are not held by the tweezers due to their moisture and softening, then grasp them with a rough cloth or with a glove made of double wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them and sprinkle some hot powders on top of the cut area to make it a place for cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey the evacuation, then enema the patient with an enema containing a small amount of purgative so that he may cleanse himself from what is in the anus, and make him obedient to evacuation when he squeezes himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the atheli are external to the anus, then their condition is light and easy; it is to grasp them with your nail or with tweezers and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them as we said, until they get well.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 If the wound is not to be cut with iron, then one should apply suture according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread wrapped around and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then remove the fat from above and make it penetrate with the point to the root on the other side; wrap the ends of the thread around the tip of the needle, and let them be wide, and tightly tie the suture with strong knots.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie the thread and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Make this with all the fat, and leave one; but do not take it out yourself, to prevent excessive bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch over the wound and put it on the anus; and order the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him go until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the fat becomes cold, care for them with ointments and other treatments, until they get well.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 Chapter on the care of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For they often occur from excessive drying of feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they become chronic and medicine does not help them, then one should shave with pointed spatula or with your own nail until they become moist, and the outer layer which prevents their healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then take care of them until they heal as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not heal: then shave them more vigorously than before until they bleed a lot, and then care for them until they get well.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 Chapter on the treatment of sores, both ulcerated and not ulcerated, as well as abscesses and boils.
Caput LXXXII.	 Head, LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 You should know that Almirmar is not anything but a round node resembling the head of a nail in color; it is found throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and it occurs from walking, causing pain.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it must be cut off what is in the surroundings of the nail-head, and held with forceps or with a pair of tweezers, and uprooted from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has come before in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 However, from the atheroma, there is one elevation, small and rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And it often happens in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch the atheroma, and cut it; or to stitch it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now the inverted atheromas are uprooted, but not the non-inverted ones with the tool that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Ant is also a small, filtered elevation, large on the surface of the body, penetrating deeply; and when it is found by coldness, it feels like the bite of an ant, and it occurs throughout the body; and it often happens in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to take a reed from a goose feather or strong bird feather; and place the reed over the ant-like elevation until it forms a circle around its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the reed until it cuts off what is around the ant-like elevation; and place it deep into the flesh, and uproot the ant-elevation from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do it with an airtight cannula or iron, in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 The upper end of the cannula should be drawn up to its limit and rolled over the thumb so that it may be easily held and turned back.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish to cauterize a scabies, do so according to what was mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and of the solution of the abdomen, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When an enema is made of silver, gold, copper or tin.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made small and large, according to those in which it is administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore what is given for the cure of small children should be small, and the enema for weak or painful anuses as well.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cannula used for the small enema should have a large upper end, which is tied to the uterus, be wide according to this method: and it should have a distinction so that the uterus may be ligated as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed, that is, not open, soft, very thin, drawn out to fine points: and in one of its sides there should be two holes, and in the other side only one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole should be according to the size of grains and not too large: and let the uterus in which the medicines are placed be an animal bladder or a sheep's skin, which is small like the shape of a small goat's foot: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be perforated with many holes as it is rolled up, and the space between each hole should be the width of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those openings a thread, preferably from a raw flax string, which is made up of ten strings or around that number, and tie it with a knot like that of the asphodel.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When the uterus is placed, tighten around its head a strong cord made of castor oil (clisterium) in two places where it is divided by a tightening mechanism.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then apply the castor oil (clisterium).
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the shape of the circle depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of the application of castor oil (clisterium) is as follows: fill the bladder or the bladder made of medicine that is heated to the amount tolerable by the sick person; be careful not for it to be too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies on his back and raises his legs towards the top; place a bedsheet or cloth under him (intahan), that is, the skin people lie on or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the castor oil (clisterium) with olive oil, or egg white, or marsh mallow gum, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the assistant take hold of the bladder with both his hands and squeeze it intensely until everything that is in the castor oil (clisterium) has been expelled into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the castor oil (clisterium), and let the sick person raise his legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine forces him out, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps through the night with it, it is more helpful in the healing process.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you apply castor oil (clisterium) to him in the disease of abscesses in the stomach and he hurries out; then repeat the castor oil (clisterium), until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or ulcers in the anus, then let the purge be very subtle and soft, from the enemas with which children are cleansed.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 Let this be the form of a subtle enema, on which the skin is tightly stretched.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Chapter on the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already said in the division of treating wounds that it belongs to the book, and here I will say the treatment with hands, and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are classified according to the cause by which they occur, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, the causes of wounds are numerous and similar to being struck by a stone; cutting with a sword or knife; being pierced with a spear, log, or arrow; and similar things from many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 However, wounds that occur according to the parts of the body are, for example, a wound on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or back; and similar ones from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the treatment of some wounds to set forth the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the memory of the compositors will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When there is a simple wound on the head and no bone fracture occurs; consider if it was caused by being struck by a stone or similar objects and only broke the skin; and if the wound is large, beware of imminent formation of hot ulcers; then hurry, and make phlebotomy immediately; do not delay this; and draw out from his blood according to its strength; if there is no prohibition for phlebotomy, especially if the blood that exits from the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 Let the sick person avoid self-filling, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something forbids reduction, then let it be reduced from food, and not approach meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place on the wound if it happens to him an abscess hot, heated clay infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is stiptic.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are secure from the hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and has not changed air, the powder that I will tell later: and if already the air has changed, then place on it some unguents until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or from a sword cut and similar: and the edges of it should not be brought together by small dots, then bring them together with stitches, according to what I will tell about stitching in abdominal wounds.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound is already detected from bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it unless in a small sling: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh to it instead of skin, and order the sick person to eat foods in which there is heaviness, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it becomes soft; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to bone: then cut off the putrefied part entirely, and throw it away; then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and it cannot be separated by medicines, then seek above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity compels and it does not conform to what has been said, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, their remedy is easy and light: thus, sprinkle this powder on them: since it solidifies them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of the Powder for Burns.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum, two parts of the blood of a dragon, and three parts of unslaked lime: grind it all thoroughly, and sieve it: and fill the wound with it, and constrict it well, until it adheres well on top, and coagulate with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it above with small linen cloths, and leave it alone, do not unbind it until it does not move away.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine is not pulled out from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 Sometimes the lime alone does this, when you do not have olibanum at hand, and even the blood of a dragon performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is placed on them and they are bound, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If the air has already changed them in some way, particularly when it is summertime, then there is no purpose for this powder: so take care of him with what I have said, place on them certain digestive ointments or make poultices from barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of the rest of the cure until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If however it happens that the wound breaks the bone and is small, then extract it with a Geste: and I will now say the cure for fractures of the skull, which will follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	 On the eighty-fifth matter [or chapter].
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment compared to a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut, then, if it is a nerve, there is no skill in its treatment except to delay care because it causes violent stiffness, like cinnabar and pitch and similar substances.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they harm nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is superior to the parts; and let what is used for treatment be from soft medicines, such as lime mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or rose oil, or pitch, when it is washed even with sweet water; and other mineral stones in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer suture; or rolled lips with powdered poultry [or chicken] parts.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound is deep or if a cavity occurs in its lower part, where pus has already gathered, then pierce it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the artery has already been cut in the wound and its blood flow has followed, then separate it or cut it off and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the windpipe (spondiles) has been cut completely or partially and the trachea has been saved, then gather the lips of the skin with suture on top of a cannula for the throat, and do not touch the throat, but rather lift it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie it with a suitable suture and let it remain for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments containing astringents and drying agents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has made an impression on the bone, then examine it thoroughly; if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them as you can: and leave what cannot be prepared to rot, until the wound separates and heals over.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then dust it with the powder I mentioned before.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If there appears to be bone in the wound and it becomes a fistula: then treat it as described in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on wounds with spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound made by a lance or knife, and you can see its depth, then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If a wound is emitting pus and the sick person breathes from it, then you know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the wound is not deep and is recent with blood, then do not apply powder to it immediately or tie it up so that the blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick person; but put on an attracting ointment and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If an attracting ointment is not available to you, then place a piece of old cotton over the wound's opening, so that it absorbs what is coming out from its moisture; and make the sick person sleep on the wound so that it can run towards it and gather together.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three days or more have passed since the wound and there is no spasm, no bad heart tremor, no constriction in breathing, and you see that its other conditions are good, then you know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Treat yourself and with liniments, and the rest of the cure, until you are healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If the healing is cut open, and it now opens continuously, then know that it has become a Fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Therefore, treat it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from sword or knife cut, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with the following from suturing, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if it has already made an impression on the bone and cut out pieces from it, then examine the wound, and hurry to remove those pieces, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, for it is better to let them be extracted when rotten.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 The judgment of the wounds resulting from accidents on other limbs is the same as that which we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on Wounds of the Abdomen and the Exit of Intestines, and their Healing.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A rupture which occurs in the abdomen, is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great rupture, intestines or the number of intestines sometimes comes out.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore, their insertion and suturing is done more forcefully and difficultly.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 A small rupture is also difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore it is more difficult to reduce them if you do not hurry for their insertion to its place immediately; since it becomes swollen, opens and thickens; therefore the entry of it becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore a medium rupture is better because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 You should know that stitching (of) the vein is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common stitches join together for the stitching of the abdomen, and for the stitching of other wounds on the body; and two other stitches properly communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they (the two common stitches) are more proper for the stitching of the abdomen; and I tell you one by one with explanation, and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to bring back (it), then this is due to one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the tear (disruption), as we have said; or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When this is so, then it is necessary to heat (it), so that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth (in) warm water only.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or you boil in water fennel seeds, and cumin, and pepper, and coriander with it (the affected intestine), until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes this (the heated matter) makes wine in which there is bitterness; and it is better than water alone for resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the inflation has been resolved, then moisten (the affected intestine) with water in which wormwood or mallow was boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For this an opening is made for it when the disease is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If its return occurs after this treatment, then sew up the tear with a little, using the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than when it is done by force and lack of an instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let the part of it that is twisted, sharp and the other part not sharp, and the end (should not be) subtle like a spatula, rather it should be less sharp; and this resembles a clam shell as you can see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it should be reduced to its natural shape in its own place if possible above it, for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When the wound is wide at the lower part of the abdomen: then it should be made to lie on its back and place its legs higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place the head and chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if the wound is in one of two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and consider that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus it must be done with large wounds and with medium sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But with small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make a devout servant of your presence hold the whole wound with his hand and gather up the lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then give him who follows to sew something after something, this is the common method of suture for one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you receive a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then detach from the edge of the wound the width of a ring finger, that is, of the doctor; and sew one needle beyond which you introduce the thread into both ends of the skin, with both ends of the sifac that is under the skin from inside, until it passes through from another side, and you have already gathered together both ends of the skin, and both ends of the sifac: and they become four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously until the lips of the wound have been gathered together by an appropriate gathering.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of the finger also, and fix another point on it; afterwards draw it straight with thread, as you did with the first point.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Do not cease to do that with the needle you require from the points, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 Let the needle be medium between thickness and subtlety; because fine needles very easily penetrate the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin; for this reason, it is necessary that they be medium in subtlety and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not necessary to shape the needle in the two extremities of skin close together; so that the flesh is not penetrated quickly, and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and they do not extend even with suturing, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the tip of the needle so as not to hurt the weak one while asleep; and place small cloth balls on them from all sides, which hold the tips of the needle; and release them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this kind of sewing with needles in such a manner is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because it is sufficient for their sewing one or two needles, or approximately those.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second sewing is common; to gather together with sewing the ends of four: the ends of skin, and the ends of the sifac in place of one, with a needle on which there is a thread wound equally in subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then, when you penetrate with the needle these ends of four, draw back the needle from the part where it entered, so that the thread pulled up from the upper part of the wound falls out; thus there will be sewing, like the sewing of cloth where cloth is bound together, and place between every sewing a quantity equal to the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 Humans know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this suture, I myself healed the wound of a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm; and there was expelled from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and the rupture was in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I then returned it after his intestines were stabilized outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound was then consolidated within a space that was approximately 15 days; and I cured him, and he recovered; and he lived many years after that, restored to his own dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians had judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore put warm water over the wound twice a day, and I persistently washed it with water sweetened with honey until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 However, I will speak of two types of sutures according to the account of the language.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it begins with sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle pierces the skin and follows the length and width of the entire body: release the tip of the sifac on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate into the tip of another one from the inner part to the outer part at the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have made it penetrate thus, then make it penetrate again in the same end needle from the outer part to the inner part; and release the tip of the sifac on the side where it was inserted, and make the needle penetrate into the tip of another one from the inner part to the outer part, and make it penetrate together with your penetration as you do so in the sifac tip at that end, until it penetrates completely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then commence also from the same side, and take out that same with its extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and extract the point that has pierced through it.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then return it into that skin, and take out the extremity of sifac on the other side with this extremity of mirach; and extract it from the skin on that side, and make it as one, and the other; and make it as one after the other, until you have extracted all of it according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the sum total of this suture is that you suture the skins of animals so that their skins will be attached: thus you suture sifac with one part of one extremity of the skin; and you let it go with another part on the other side, until you have completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second kind of proper suture, as Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This discourse is told as if one should suture it in the same way as those who heal do, that is, by bringing together all parts fitting to each other according to nature; and by joining the extremity of sifac with its other extremity, and the extremity of mirach with the other extremity of it.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And that is done as I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you shape the point on the extremity of mirach close to yourself from the outer part, and make it penetrate into the inner one alone; and you let go of the two extremities of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the point and make it penetrate from the outer part into the two extremities of sifac, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both of them and make both penetrate from the inner part to the outer one, into the two extremities of mirach on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is better than the common easy one, and it is the suture whose previous description has been remembered.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This is therefore the saying of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And they said something.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The suture of the abdomen is being repaired with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 What is to be done is to insert a thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of a needle from that which is near to you, and let it pass through to the other side, according to the seam of those who sew leather equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then the suture of it is more difficult than the rest of the places of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of the treatment of the wound, is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 What is to be done is that when you conquer a recent wound with its own blood, before the air alters it; and you reduce the intestine, and cleanse it and prepare it; then put it over powdered incarnations.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the air has already altered the wound; then put on it some unguents that are present to you, so that they make pus, and let threads fall, and be covered with sifac and myrrh.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no medications present to you; then put over it immediately, when it begins to emit pus, old cloth; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need any other medication when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in damage; then it is necessary that you immerse linen softened in oil of temperate heat, or in rose oil; and put it in the area around the genitals, and under the shoulders.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for it often happens that this occurs), then clisterize him with warm stiptic wine; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and a penetrating evacuation has been made into its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what is from the small intestine is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine that is called Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of the abundance of its veins, and the size of them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If what proceeds from the wound is pus, and you have recently found it; lead it back according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If however, it has passed space and has already become green or black; then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place that has turned black from it, to prevent blood flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in pus there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from below on the lower part of the wound outside it; to relieve its attraction upon you, and extraction of the pus at the site of the wound, and the emission of the pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Remembering a wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the Intestine and it is small; then it may be possible to restore it in some people; because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and it became a Fistula, and exuded feces, and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore treated [it], until I was not confident in its healing; neither did I cease to explore it, until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 When I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the patient, lest something harmful might happen to it in its belly; and no such harm happened to him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better dispositions of himself, eating and drinking, and urinating, and entered the bath, and was exercised in his regimen.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of the experimentalists said that when an injury occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And it is, that you receive ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound and place one ant with an open mouth on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When its head is placed upon them, and it closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick and cannot be loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing that according to the size of the wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then return it [the patient] and sew up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached in the intestine until it is eaten, and healed, and no harm comes to the patient from this.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is now possible that the intestine can be tied even with a thin thread; this has been removed from the animal's intestine and attached to it after it is inserted into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and scrape it a lot.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a thin linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert the thread into the point and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to dislocation.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 This method of suture with worms and intestine, is not but by the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large, wide wound, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no skill but subtlety, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on the care of the bladder, and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or boil when it becomes old and decays, and turns into an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, nor is it cut off: then it is called universally in whatever member it may be Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And Fistula indeed is according to truth a knot filtered, hard, white: with which there is no pain, but it has the hollow of a bird's feather: and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And it is at certain times moist which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps moisture is cut in certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is much and it is little; and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal nor grows flesh in it is not that because of one cause, but because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of which is due to scarcity of blood in the body; or due to its malice; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing growth of flesh; or because it is full of filths and filthinesses; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter sent to it is of bad quality; or because the remedy is inappropriate for its healing; or because corruption falling on the region is a kind of pestilence, or due to the property of the region as happens in Caesaraugusta: there is difficult digestion of diseases and healing of boils is delayed by nature; or because in it is one bone, or number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown you all those causes and their signs, as well as their treatments with medicines in division: here it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment for a Fistula and a Zukan, which occurs by way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Know then that a Fistula happens in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For among these [conditions] are Fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines; or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs; or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the joints; such as the hand and foot: and among these are those that come close to a principal member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 That which among these Fistulas is according to this method, is one that is difficult for healing, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If it is among the Fistulas one whose depth does not reach to those places that I have mentioned: and if you hope for healing of it, and trust in its treatment, and wish to reach knowledge about it: then take a probe made from bronze or iron, if the fistula extends along a straight path, and carefully investigate it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is twisting in the Fistula: then investigate it with a probe made from fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead is softened and is easily bent around a twist.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the Fistula has multiple openings: it is not possible for you to probe it.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Cauterize therefore from among its openings one opening.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture that you cauterize it with, flows in reverse through other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully investigate and inquire according to the method that is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the fistula has a hollowed out area far away or near; or whether it is a fistula with multiple openings, which covers the entire thing, with all your strength: with your questioning of the patient, and the examination of pain when compressed with your hand at the place, and similar signs and symptoms.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When therefore you have stood over all that station truly, then go for treatment according to confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if it is a Fistula near appearing, or in a safe place distant from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the Fistula according to what was mentioned in my narrative, and remove what is in it by filtration, and corrupt flesh, that is born in its opening from flesh, or membrane, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If the Fistula is deep-seated and straight, then it should be cut as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then clean it from all the corrupt flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer a linen bandage wrapped in sharp medicines: and insert it up to the concavity of the Fistula that you have grasped with iron: do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes everything that remains in the concavity of the Fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 But if it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as we have told.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the Fistula is bone, and you are certain of this: then inquire about it, and cut it according to what I have told you: if it does not prevent you from anything from the vein, or nerve, or main member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a bone is discovered for you and there is something corrupted and blackened in it: then file it down until the corruption of it is completely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with that which causes it to heal itself, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did: then know, that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Therefore, excise above it a second time, and seek out its reason, and cleanse it thoroughly with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore, you are not capable in it, except to let it go by nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the rotten bone is small and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for that purpose.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are several bones, then seek out their removal altogether, do not leave anything of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If a resistance comes to you from something related to the moistures, and it is not fear or error in the incision of them, then cut those moistures and fleshes, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then place over the wound something that will rot it; and let it go until it rots what is around the bones from fleshes and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound so that it does not become consolidated.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And compress the incision which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place on it, if you are afraid, a piece of copper submerged in finely ground sulfur with oil; or a piece of copper submerged in the Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moistures rot and separate from the bones, their removal will be facilitated, and their pulling out.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is a large bone, such as the leg bone, or hip bone, and similar to them, and what has been rotten from it is a large part: then shave it with ultimate rasp, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is inside it is rotten and it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to sew it up, and to cut it all the way through until the place where the corruption has reached: then care for it, until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you about the case that happened to a man in his leg: put it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 The man was young and about thirty years old, who had a pain in his limb, caused by something that moved upon him within the body, that is, from inside, until the matter reached the leg, and it was cut out with a large incision: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 The time elapsed with the error of physicians until the abscess was opened, and many substances gathered around it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 After the treatment of this was delayed, until the leg became a fistula, and many openings were made in it: which all discharged pus, and bodily moisture.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 A multitude of physicians cured him for about two years, and no one skilled in the art of surgery was there until I was summoned and saw his leg, and the substances that were flowing from those openings with a large course: even the body of the man had already become paralyzed, and his complexion was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found that they were reaching each other from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I approached it and cut open one of the openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already rotten, and darkened, and had become putrid, and pierced through until it penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I then sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I separated, which was not in the bone except that corruption, which I cut off and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed the healing of the wound with strengthening medicines in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 Not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and opened a second incision above the first incision; and I found continuous decay along with the bone; and I excised what appeared to me also from that decay.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	 Not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Then I opened it again and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece and attempt its restoration; but it was not restored until I cut from the bone approximately one palm's breadth and extracted that along with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored it with medicines and it consolidated quickly and healed; and this iteration was not necessary in the operation or cutting of it, except due to the disposition of the patient's weakness, his little tolerance, and my fear over him regarding death; because it happened to him at all hours from an excess of evacuation, with bad fainting spells.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 He was therefore completely healed; and new flesh grew hard at the site of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned; and he turned back to his dispositions; and he did not suffer any harm at all from walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If the protruding bone in the body is already broken; then it should be excised in this way: and it is: take a ligament and tie it at the end of the protruding bone; and command someone to pull it upwards; and place another larger ligament over the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind it over the flesh that is attached to the bone; and extend its end so that you pull the flesh downwards; and you will open the flesh over the place where you wish to excise, so as not to harm the knife.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or board under the bone below it properly; because when you do that, it is not forbidden to cut away decayed flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 It is necessary that the Trephine (Serratura) be over the diseased area slightly, so that there is no excavation of the bone in the corrupt place; and it does not appear to the senses in its appearance, and compels another for its Trephination.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and not projecting, but rather adjoining a part of it; and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it: then cut away all the flesh from every part.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place the lever below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then cut with the saw on that side where the corruption is, until the Trephine is joined on the other side; and let the Trephine be slightly shorter than the length of the corruption, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at a joint: cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it adjoins on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the corruption is at the junction of two joints: then it has no cure except for abrasion (scraping).
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is in the beak of the hand or foot: then there is a great difficulty in that.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 It is necessary that you examine how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 Scrape (abrade) it and clean it according to whatever disposable condition you have, and with whatever tool it can be corrected for you; as long as it does not cause opposition to a Vein or a Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that cutting and sawing tools for bones are many according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their roughness or fineness, their size, smallness, hardness and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore it is necessary that you prepare a tool suitable for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the type of tool you need according to the effort required, when your study is prolonged.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 Recognition of the methods of this art is evidence of the methods of diseases: for then you will find for yourself that which is suitable to him from instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 I am strengthening you at the end of this chapter with the number of instruments, which you shall place examples on, and proof on others.
Forma Serrae.	 Form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of the saw should be made correctly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Make its upper part an arch, sharpen it with iron; and make its handle of boxwood, and make it pyramidal correctly.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Form of the rasp for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this rasp should be in the form of a star keycap; and its points should be according to the form of the points of the file-rake.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 It is not suitable unless it is rubbed with it on the heads of joints when they are broken, or a large and great bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Form of the larger rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Form of the middle-sized rasp.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Form of the broad rasp.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Form of the rasp with a hollow.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Form of another, more delicate rasp.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Form of another rasp with a curved tip.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form of the small, delicate rasp.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form of the rasp for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also, the form of the large rasp.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 It resembles a Chisel and its tip is like a saw; it is used in many places by reason of bone-files.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Form of the rasp suitable for filing that which has been perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its tip is triangular and sharp-pointed.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, it is necessary that all things which we have said are made of file makers, cutters and sawyers.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 On the incision of extremities and the setting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Head, LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 They rot at the extremities, either externally or internally.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 If you have treated that corruption with medicinal care and it does not improve: and if you see the corruption advance in a limb which nothing has checked: then it is necessary that you amputate that limb until the corruption exits, so that the weak may pass through it from death or from the greater evil which is due to the loss of a member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign of this (affliction) is that the limb darkens until it appears rotten; or it is burned by fire and then rots after being blackened; until the rot is amputated up to where it follows the limb, and it spreads through the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Approach it (the wound) then with the incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from a blow by certain poisonous creatures such as marine scorpions, vipers, adders, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If corruption or a blow occurs at the tip of the finger, then amputate the finger and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread, so that it may not advance toward the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens in the hand, then amputate it at its root and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread, until it takes hold of the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it advances in the arm, then amputate the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If the corruption passes through and you see that it is about an elbow-length, then there is death for the weak one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And beyond that in treatment is the measure of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do this for the foot when corruption advances in the toe; then amputate it at one joint: and if it takes hold of the ball of the foot, then amputate the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If it reaches up to the knee, then amputate the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in that except to release and leave the weak one to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 The method for cutting a limb, or for tying it, is to tighten the ligament below where you wish to cut, and then tighten another ligament above the same place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 Extend the servant ligament one to the lower parts, and extend the other servant ligament upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a wide spatula, until the whole flesh is laid bare.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it should be cut or tied.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you place a cloth of linen over all the parts and not touch the healthy place with the knife; and if there should be any injury to the weak, let it be accompanied by hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If there should be internal bleeding while you are working, then quickly cauterize the place or put some powders on it that absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same thing happens that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 Because blackening occurred in his foot, like burn caused by fire; and the decay first affected his toe, until it spread to the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 The man then moved away from himself, after he saw the decay occur in his limb with great pain, which he found by pain and burn; and he cut it at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long period of time, the same decay occurred in the index finger of his other hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 He then came to me, and I attempted to recover the shortage by applying medicine to his hand after cleaning his body; but there was no improvement, and it spread to another finger; until decay began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He therefore called me to cut his hand; and I did not want it, hoping that there would be excess repercussion from me on him; and I also feared his death during the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because a man's virtue was above his fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 Since he had given up on me, he returned to his own land; and he came to me from him, because he hastened, and he cut off his entire hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I have not brought this narrative except as an aid for that which falls under the genus of this sickness; and it is to signify what is signified, and according to how it is carried out.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Chapter on Care of the Sinews, and the Quality of Cleansing with Medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess extends until it makes a collection of pus; then it bursts or perforates and what is within the pus exits, and there remains a hollow place as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is above it is like a thin cloth; and it does not reach its final corruption nor presses on bone, nerve, or ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus; and it is not called a fistula; but if the space of it extends until corruption presses into one of these members, then it is called a fistula, or ulcer.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And the care of it is to cut that skin all around as it rolls; especially when it has become thin and made like a cloth; and you trust that it will not adhere because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you hope that the skin will adhere and it does not follow that this final corruption follows; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with cleansing; and it is to consider for a sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul smell: then clisterize it with medicine from Egypt, which is vinegar, oil, and zinziber, taking equal parts, and mix them in a vessel: and boil it over fire until the medicine turns red and thickens like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what is necessary from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize the sinus with it: and bind up the opening of it, and let the medicine remain in it for a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then extract it with pressure: make this for days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And at times clisterize with water and ashes, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is so that you may take the ashes of vinewood logs, or the ashes from oak trees: and pour water upon it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then cook it and clisterize with it until you are confident that the sinus is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient is not able to endure the Egyptian medicine or water and ashes, then clisterize it with water and honey mixed with a little crushed ginger.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or clisterize it with honey and wine mixed together, because the property of honey is to cleanse and wash: and wine makes the sinus sticky, especially when there is an excess of stiffness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 Whenever you do this and believe that the corruption of the sinus is already removed: then clisterize it with what causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is so that you may take from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine: or clisterize it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the orifice of the Sinus is narrow and cannot take the cannula for cleansing: then widen it slightly with iron; or place linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment in it until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the orifice is also wide, then bring the lips together with suture; and let the amount go in which cleansing enters without additional quantity.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated towards above: then cut it in a lower location within it, so that the pus flows out below; because pus when constricted in the depth of the Sinus, prevents flesh to grow in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus about below as you wish: then try to prepare a member so that pus flows out from it with ease according to how you are prepared for it.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything from the pus in it at all; and receive medicines that are applied on top of the wound, suitable for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the linen cloth be of such size that it allows communication with the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors a hole straight in the orifice of the Sinus, wider than the orifice of the Sinus slightly.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread soft ointments over a second linen cloth according to the size of the hole; and place it on top of it at a distance from the orifice of the Sinus, so that the exit of pus is relieved; and do not remove the large linen cloth unless after several days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 The one who is on the orifice of the Sinus, is the one whom you remove at every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus is expelled; and know this, whether the liquid that flows out of it is much, little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And again consider the place of the sinus, whether its lord feels pain there, or there is no pain there, and if there is an abscess there, or there is no abscess there.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When your treatment is thus extended, and you see the matter coming out of the sinus opening, then you shall know that the sinus has adhered or is approaching adherence; therefore dissolve it in the morning or on the third day: and when you open the wound, then change the bandage, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If however pus comes out of the sinus after a long time, subtle matter, then do not despair of its adherence, for healing is approaching, since there are men who delay wound healing and there are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If however after many days pus that is not digested comes out of the sinus, then you shall know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If the adherence of the sinus is delayed and prolonged, then add astringents to the treatment, but let the physicians make sure that the treatments are humid in substance and dry in effect, such as ointment dyafinicon when it is made with an excess of zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the ultimate remedy, it is that you shall receive ointment dyafinicon, which is dissolved with rose oil and shaken over it equal old wine by volume in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix it with that and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now make a similar action when you do not have ointment dyafinicon, honey, when you boil it until it thickens and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or receive myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; grind all of them together, and powder it over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then draw a line upon the cloth over it, and bind it over the bladder; and draw with honey that you have boiled, until it thickens; and powderize the substance, and place it upon the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes administered in it long arsenic (Aristolochia), and roots of celestial lily, and is lily; and flour of the plant, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them as simple ones, or combined, grind them and the vessels themselves; and powderize over honey that I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the matter of the bladder is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then you shall know that there is corruption in its depth; or it already makes an impression on the bones, or in the other hard members, or ligaments; then cure it with fistula treatment, according to what was mentioned before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Chapter on the treatment of boils and scratched nails, and incision and cutting.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter CXCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Boil (Panaritium) is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb finger or toe; and perhaps it arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When it is prolonged and neglected in the treatment of its abscess, and it becomes abscessed with hot abscess; or it is corrupted and emits pus until it erodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it completely corrupts it, and corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul odor; and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and the color of it becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you treat it, when as we said, your treatment does not help; then it is necessary that you cut with iron all the surplus that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For cauterization is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and also the nail is sound, and empty additions press the flesh towards the interior and begin to pierce it and wound it: then it is necessary that you place subtle Radium under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh and push it up; and cut the flesh easily, and apply on it what remains of the medicine from burning, corrosive substances until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Cure it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If already corruption presses on the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it; for the bone will never heal as long as a corrupted bone remains within.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see corruption and spreading of the tumor on a finger, then cut it at one knuckle, according to its previously mentioned description.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If however the nail is worn down or struck, and there is a violent pain, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp instrument called Spatulium in a crosswise direction from above towards the visible part.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause an increase of violent pain over the patient and this will lead to the growth of additional flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then treat that place with a remedy that soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 A finger that is born in some human hands may be all flesh; and it may have bones in some of them, and a nail in others; and some of these are born at the root of the joint or its growth begins in some knuckles of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 That which is born on some knuckles of the finger does not move; and that which is born near a joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 The fleshly one among them is easily cut open.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 To cut it at its root with a broad spatula (spatumili lato).
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 The treatment of the one whose birth is joined to the juncture of the roots is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from cutting it (him).
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 In the one who is born on the digit at the end of the knuckles, then it is necessary to cut the flesh of his round incision up to the bone first.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws that fit for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Consolidation that happens to the fingers often occurs either from the birth of man, meaning it is born with him, or from consolidation of wounds, burns by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut off that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place a piece of linen or cloth soaked in rose oil between them to prevent their rapid consolidation and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate until the location is healed according to what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then cut off that consolidation according to what is prepared and fits the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 Chapter on Defects of Incisions.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter XCII (92).
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Chapters 92: The swellings are the veins that are twisted, thick, and filled with melancholic excesses which occur in many parts of the body; and most frequently they happen in the legs, especially in those who travel often and labor, and those who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer a purgative of the body with strong emetics from black bile at times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then make a venesection (bloodletting) from the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The cure of them (wounds or ulcers) with iron is in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of these is to lance and draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other way is to open a vein and drain completely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The lancing (of an abscess) is done in this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Pour warm wine or vinegar over the leg first, with much hot water, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the affected leg from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the thigh with bandages.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three places, making a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then drain (the blood) by hand, that is, draw out the blood from the lower part of the leg to the top, and it is necessary that the patient be bled first by the leech.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail to below, until the quantity of blood which you see is sufficient and that which the strength of the patient can endure.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Afterwards bind it (the wound) and order him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat the leeching and bloodletting when the veins are filled, and this hurts the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The draining (of an abscess) is done in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Scrape the affected leg if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then immerse it (the leg) in a bath; or pour warm water over the affected leg until it turns red and the veins swell; or exercise it with strong movements if there is no bath available for him, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then make a long incision directly over the vein; or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with unguis (nails), and scrape the vein from all sides, until it becomes sensitive; and at its appearance, what you see is turning from red to dark purple.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it comes out of the skin, you see it white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert under it (the vein) radium (small rod-like instrument), until when it is raised and comes out of the skin; hang it with a blind nail, softly.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape the skin from the top of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then lift it (the vein) with radii (small tongs-like instruments) as you did before, and hang it with another nail as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then cut another section or multiple sections as needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then lift it (the vein) and make the final incision at the heel (calcaneum).
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then pull out the portion above the sectioned area.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 Do this until you pull out the entire vein from the upper section or all sections, until when it comes out entirely; then make the final incision (cut).
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to pull out and lift; then insert the awl with a strong thread twice, tie it and pull it (the vein) out itself; or insert under it radium; and turn your hand over all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful, do not cut (it).
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it and there may be injury from this on the patient.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you pull out the entire vein; then place on the wound site a linen soaked in wine and rose oil or olive oil; and take care of him until he heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is contracted with a winding shape and does not follow what was said according to rectitude; then it is necessary that you find (pierce) all parts of its winding, and the points of its winding.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with forceps until you have removed it entirely: and beware at your cut on it not to injure the vein or wound it: for it will be difficult for you to remove or extract it if injured.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Preserve your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The method of healing a wound caused by a thorn.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The procedure for blinding with a hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not like the other hooks in hardness or sharpness at its end so as not to injure a vein: and it has a large flexibleness, gentle: because if it were subtle, it would injure a vein with its subtlety: rather, let it have an excess of bulk, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the extraction of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the limbs on warm lands, as Alizegi says, and in the lands of the Arabs, and in dry, warm lands with little softness, that is, where no plant or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the limbs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Indeed, its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms called ascariasis and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the beginning of this vein's manifestation is that it happens when there is a swelling in the limb.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then it is blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of blistering, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When its end appears from it, then it is necessary that you roll over on it a piece of lead whose weight is a keil drachm, up to two drachms and the node: and release the suspended lead from the limb.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out from there to the outside, encase it in lead, and tie it up.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it extends too much, then cut off a part of it, and encase the remaining portion.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut it at the root before it comes out completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; it causes an abscess to appear, and rot in that place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it should be treated gently and extracted gradually until it comes out completely from the end of it, and nothing remains from it in the body; and from this vein, in some men, there comes out what is in length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has reached me, because a man has come out from twenty palms (length).
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut during your treatment time: then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long one, along with the body, until all that is in it from matter is evacuated; and administer the rottenness of the place with medications for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then treat it as an abscess cure.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself; and multiple openings occur to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore, treat it as we have said in the section, and with what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 [Section on] Surgery of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bouin disease.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Bouin disease in a certain land among us, because it often occurs to cows and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it pervades the whole body, ascending and descending; and it is shown to the sense during its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts at any place where it bursts on the skin, and escapes.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 Its generation is from the rottenness of certain fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms occur in the abdomen.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it is feared from its malignity.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it pervades the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place; then perhaps it opens there, and escapes, and destroys an eye; and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 When one wishes to heal it and extract it, then this is not done except during its movement and appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, one must tighten what is above it, and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it penetrates into the flesh and you do not find it; then place a cautery on the place with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And the greater one fears, is its corruption which destroys the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you see it already reaching the head near the eye; then tighten below it with a good bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And the sick one must use his self-cleaning of the body with medications dissolving bad, rotten fluids.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him beware of foods causing rottenness.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Chapter on the incision due to Nakir's disease.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter CXV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called in our land Nakir; and it is pain which occurs in certain limbs; then it changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have already seen it, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was summoned to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she rolled up her arm, and I saw a smaller swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after staying for an hour, I saw a swelling move with a probe, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible; as quick as living silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain then left that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then she sat for an hour, and ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it was turning over its entire body, as I observed.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I marveled at the rapidity of its change from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, I had not seen this illness with my eyes before in such a manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I have seen many who suffer from a change of pain from limb to limb; I have not seen it with my eyes as I have seen it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything other than because the woman was from those who are from dry villages, with veins exposed; hence it appears to the sense that the windiness was changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this reason in those who are well-nourished and in bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Since you desire to cure it and the patient feels that pain; if it appears to your eye as we have said, then squeeze above it, quickly below it; cut above it until that windiness constricted emerges; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with the expulsion of the body and with that which expels windiness; crush and expel them with foul pills and pills made from soapwort and similar substances.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter LXVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 The arrows are diversified according to their types and the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 The diversity of arrows is that some have large tips and small ones; some are concave and others blind.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those having three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And from these are those which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 Indeed, those which are according to the members on which they fall, it is according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 For indeed members are either hollowed from the main limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When it falls into any one of these members and appears to you as signs of death, which I shall tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you cut out the extraction of this arrowhead from them, for death follows it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs do not appear to you and the arrowhead is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it yourself and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For the signs of the brain when an arrowhead falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits from what is above the brain are: because headache occurs from that, and scotoma (blindness), and dizziness, and redness in eyes, and swelling, and redness of tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of choler.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood will come out from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And from the wound site comes out moisture white like pulp (of a vegetable)
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 From there it goes out something similar to liquid flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out by itself.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are as follows: it is near the left nipple and it feels as though it were fixed in a hard thing, not in something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow's movement is like the movement of the pulse and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And this is followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore, know that death is approaching certainly.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 The sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the emission of frothy blood from the wound, and vessels that follow the neck must be removed, and the color of the sick must be changed.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it breathes out a great, deep breath, and seeks attraction to cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the pleura, which is in the chest, then it is near small ribs; and there is a great shortness of breath with intense pain, with sighing, and all limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if the arrow falls into the abdomen and lodges there, something like feces or a bladder that has already been torn apart comes out from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore, there is no hope for its cure nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out, and something proceeds to the outside and the pain is greater than the sickness; then know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, as well as the face, neck, throat, spatula, aid, dorsal vertebrae, hip, leg, and similar bones are saved according to various arrangements when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I saw about these arrows, so that it may indicate to you regarding your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 What happened is that an arrow fell into the eye of a certain man, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore I extracted it from the other side, below his ear fat: and he was healed, and no damage occurred to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen upon his eyelid under the lower lid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not obtain anything more than a small part of it which adhered to its wooden shaft: and the arrow was large among the arrows of Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no feathers.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore the Jew was healed, and no accidental harm occurred to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And the arrow was Arabian, and it had feathers.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore I made an incision over it between two windpipes: and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I became sharp with it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man who it had fallen upon his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed and nothing was changed in his condition, I made an incision over the arrow: and I probed it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no accidental harm occurred to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man upon whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was consolidated over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman whose arrow fell into her womb, and the wound healed upon her, and the arrow remained within her; and no change occurred in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man, whose arrow fell into his face; and the wound healed, and it remained, not finding him much pain; and similar things happened many times.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted the arrow from a man among the king's princes, which had fallen upon him in the middle of his nose and had already begun to turn slightly toward the right; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore I was called for his treatment after the loss of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I therefore found the wound of the arrow to be very narrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 Then I probed it with a delicate probe and did not feel it; but he himself found a puncture and pain on his right side beneath his ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore I hoped that the puncture was at the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 Then I applied a plaster to the place where there was an attractant and digestive virtue, confident that the wound would heal and appear to me the sign of the arrow, so that I could cut above it; but it did not happen at the expected place, showing that the arrow had missed its mark.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I therefore remained with the plaster upon him for many days; but it did not happen as expected, and the wound healed in the meantime; and he remained weak from the extraction of it until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore I put sharp, corrosive medicine upon that wound for many days until it opened; and when I probed it myself, I felt the subtle end of the arrow which was attached to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added sharp medicine to the opening of the wound until it became visible that the arrow-tip appeared to us; and moreover, he passed away from me with that time span of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 After the wound was expanded and I had the opportunity to insert forceps into it, and move it, but it did not obey to come out; then I did not stop trying, and devising means for it with all my crafts, until on a certain day when the forceps were well made according to their form at the end of the chapter, I pulled it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the nasal cartilage does not heal.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore restored it, and the wound healed, and the weak health became whole; nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you about the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you put this rule and significance upon what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Because the parts and divisions of this art are not grasped with the narrative; neither does that book grasp it, nor a prudent craftsman compares much with little; and concerning what is present, about what is absent: and he discovers a new operation, and a new tool for descents of external things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I say that arrows do not come out from the members to which they are fixed, unless in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by being drawn out from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or on the contrary, by the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which comes out from where it entered is either a projectile in a fleshy place; and it is drawn, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey to come out from the hour when it fell; then it is necessary that you leave it for some days until the flesh around it rots; and the attraction of it will weaken, and its coming out will take place.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly, if it is incised in the bone and does not obey you for discharge, then release it even for several days; and repeat it with attraction and movement every day, until it discharges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not obey you for discharge after several days, then it is necessary to bore holes around the bone with a fine lancet from all sides until the splinters are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw it out and remove it (the foreign body).
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain and there appear some of the symptoms I mentioned earlier, then refrain from drawing the arrow out and let it be for several days until its state has become equal (with the body).
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow reaches the spinal column, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except within the body of the bone itself and does not penetrate as far as the spinal column, and the man remains sick for some days without any of the mentioned symptoms occurring: then apply skill in drawing out the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is fixed deeply and does not obey you for drawing out, then administer a lancet around the arrow as I told you; then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow is already hidden in the body's location, and it is concealed and hidden from sensation, then search for it with probing (exploration).
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel the arrow, then draw it out with certain instruments suitable for its drawing out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot draw it out due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in depth, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there: then pierce (make a small opening) above it until the wound is enlarged enough for the arrow to be extracted.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears to which he is holding, then free the fixed flesh in them from every side, with every artifice you can, and if not possible for dislocation of the flesh beyond the fracture of the ears, then twist until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 When you administer the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use twisting with your hand, along with forceps to all parts, until you make it come out: and subtlety of last subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its attraction and removal becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot do it from one hour, then leave it for some days, until what is around its circumference putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then repeat it: indeed the tunica will become loose. But if the counteraction makes bleeding for you, then administer what we said in the cure chapter of it: and keep your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer artifice in every way as possible for the extraction of the arrow: and it should be with ease, calmness, slowness, or firmness, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, you make him weak according to the figure, according to which the arrow was at the time of its fall in him.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 But if it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that goes out from the opposite side of another part, or already proceeds something towards the exterior: or makes humpiness at the end of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it projecting: cut therefore above it, and the cut should be according to the amount so that forceps can catch in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw it out, for it becomes easy to expel.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrowhead impresses on the bone and dilates itself; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: let it be for some days; then attempt it again until it exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the arrow shaft is in it, then push it out along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If the arrow shaft fell off and you wish to administer force: then insert a concave instrument into it so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow; then push it out along with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If the arrow is concave, then push it out with the instrument inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow is pulled by that (instrument).
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut all the flesh where the venom is; if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then care for it with whatever suits that (injury).
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow is falling into the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close to where you touch it with your probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then suture the wound, if you see it, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends should be similar to a bird's beak, which have been made thus of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And they are made in many different sizes, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow, its narrowness, and the width and constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 Form of a lever concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 The form of a deafening thrower (or projectile).
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the end of the bowstring-like instrument similar to a radius (for) its passage into the concave arrow, and it is propelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the lever's concave form is concave, like a bird's feather: for its passage into the arrow and the thrust from it.

Indeed, bloodletting of the two veins that are after the ears is a help for old catarrhs, and for hematoma, and for scrofulas, and for old ulcers of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of bloodletting it (the vein) is according to what I have described.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it should be shaved (the head of the sick person): and the back part of his head should be rubbed at the place of two veins with a rough cloth for good rubbing.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick person should bind his neck with bandage until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And their places are after the ears, in two depressed parts of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 You should seek them with your finger, and where you feel a pulse from them under your finger, there mark it with wax.

But the benefit of venesection of the forehead vein is after venesection of the cerebral vein, for the ancient pains in the face; and for hemicrania, and redness; and for foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of this venesection is as I have told you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 A weak person should bind his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Here is its shape (description).
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the pointed end of the Fossorium on the vein and strike it with a mallet or another tool in its manner; then let the blood flow according to the quantity you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then heal the puncture of the weak person, and tie it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet during venesection.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, the venesector should not be one with a sharp point, as are the other venesectors, but rather one with a broad point.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 The venesection should be made across (transversely), because the bone is close; and possibly the venesector will break it if it is too sharp.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 Chapter on venesection of veins in two Lacrimal sacs.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 But the benefit of the two veins that are in the two Lacrimal sacs of two eyes is for the eye affected by scabs and redness; also for swelling in the eye, and the pains of the face.

Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 For if the phlebotomist is subtle at the extremity, perhaps it breaks.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let run from the blood as much as it necessary for you.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 [Section] On the phlebotomy of Nasic Veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The veins of the nose, phlebotomy is for acute fever, and violent swelling, and ailments of the face, such as hemigraine and redness which occurs on the face; especially when it is old.

Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a subtle, long cutter; and fix it in the middle of the tip of the nose, between that which separates the nose according to straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 For the vein is not visible there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that you hold the end of your hand with the cutter slightly; and let run from the blood according to your necessity.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then tie it at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 [Section] On the phlebotomy of Guidi veins.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 Indeed, two of the phlebotomies of Guidi are for the constriction of coughing, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic ailments, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that are corroding; that is, herpes or meningeal.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of phlebotomy is that it binds the sick one under both neck with a ligature; and the craftsman stands over the head of the sick one, and the sick one sits on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then phlebotomy vein to the length of phlebotomy shall be somewhat less.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw a measured amount of blood, or according to what you see for the necessity that is for it.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Afterwards loosen the ligature, and bind two veins tightly together: so that the sick one does not faint.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And let it (the vein) be until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 For the wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 [Title: On Phlebotomy of Veins by Albucasis]
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The veins, according to Albucasis, are useful for phlebotomy because they help with alcoholism in the mouth, and corruption of teeth; and with sores, fissures of the lips, sores (also) which are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of phlebotomy for those is, that you make the sick one sit before you; and bind his neck with a linen cloth.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins; one of which is from the right side of the lip, and the second from the left of it; and the demonstration of each is by blackening both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true because around them (the veins) there are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Cut therefore each one with a cutting instrument.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt on you and you do not know which one it is; then direct your attention to the larger one of them and that one more clearly.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip; and most of all is custom with it (the phlebotomy); and cut two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 On phlebotomy: Vein under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 Of the two veins which are under the tongue, phlebotomy is beneficial: because phlebotomy of the cephalic is for affections that are in the throat, and for diseases of the palate, and for diseases of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing these (veins) is that the sick person should sit before you in the sunlight; and loosen his tongue, and look beneath it on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein; and the color of both should lean towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 So, phlebotomize each (vein), and be careful not to injure your hand while phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For beneath these (veins) are the arteries, and possibly there will be bleeding from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 On three veins in the elbow:
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those whose phlebotomy is customary in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy of these (veins) is made according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or by puncturing with a broad-bladed phlebotome (myrtine): or by applying oil to the point of the vein for softening: or by cutting with a phlebotome of a knife, and this is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 This Alnesil (instrument) is for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these (veins) there are broad and narrow forms according to the size and constriction of the veins: The form of the phlebotome myrtine is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it (the phlebotome myrtine) is suitable for opening curved veins, full, projecting, visible, thick, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 This phlebotomist is smaller in size and more subtle in cutting.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 It suits for the venesection of fine veins containing subtle, citron-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Chapter on Venesection (Phlebotomy) from Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 Among the three veins of phlebotomy, the Basilica is helpful.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from ailments that are under the throat and neck, as it follows the chest and abdomen; it is suitable for the phlebotomist to perform phlebotomy on it, so that he may be careful, and it should be done with caution because below it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If the phlebotomist makes a mistake and adds in the prick, he will cut that artery and there will be bleeding.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, it is necessary that neither the phlebotomist nor the phlebotomee pricks (it); instead, it should be cut with a lancet (Alnesil).
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the Basilica does not appear in a clear manifestation, then it is necessary that you search for another or change to another; or look for one of its branches; or use the arm as replacement for phlebotome (Funem brachii).
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 It is indeed clear and should be cut with a lancet (Anesil) as we said earlier.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish to perform the venesection of that (same) one, then it is necessary before tightening the arm, so that you touch the place, until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with a hot iron, afterwards tighten the arm, and cut the vein with a curved incision using a lancet (Alnesil) as we said earlier.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful that the blow does not fall into the space from the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tighten the bandage, an expansion (inflation) at the place which you marked with hot iron, then that expansion is an expansion of the artery; avoid it therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rise during venesection, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin, red: then you know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then hurry up, and place your finger over it at a longer space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tie the arm, and let it be; and let the weak avoid moving it; and let there be fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for some days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If the blood does not flow off and presses you, and medicine is not present to you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its extremities contract, and the blood flows off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree and pound it; take half of it, and tie it over the appropriate place of the vein's narrowing, with a ligature and pledgets until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 If the blood flows off, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if it does not: then cure the place with the memory of the one who went before, by removing dust that stops the flow of blood; and the removal of its blood is not difficult in many positions due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Chapter on venesection of the femoral vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The help of the femoral vein venesection is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body; therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein, and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is fitting for the venesectionist that he fear that place from venesection because a nerve is beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If therefore nerve is touched in the puncture of phlebotomy, and faintness occurs, difficult will be its healing, and it may not recover fully.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If however it is hidden in some people and it is delicate and not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where you can phlebotomize it, a section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then pierce the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 Chapter on the Vein of the Head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The phlebotomy of the Vein of the Head is beneficial because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is proper in this vein, if you wish, that when phlebotomizing it with the oil phlebotomy or the myrtle phlebotomy, it is oiled with oil of olive or myrtle: because it is safer than all veins, because it is not below an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 Nevertheless it is suitable for you at the phlebotomy, that you avoid the head and arm only, and seek a softer place: and it will not hurt it, if it is not found with the first blow, that you repeat over it with the phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Nevertheless perhaps it may be bled when not phlebotomized in the first blow, but it will not harm it that bleb in some.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the Usefulness of Phlebotomy, and Cautions to be Observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality of phlebotomy, and its effects from which you should consider correcting it.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First of all you should know that phlebotomy is not administered unless for the conservation of health, and its maintenance, and caution against the onset of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And let phlebotomy be performed on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely, the Cephalic, the Flexor, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And let phlebotomy be done at the beginning of spring while fasting, and during summer and autumn after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 Let phlebotomy be done on the first day or third day after passing three hours from the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 However, phlebotomy administered for illness does not have a fixed hour; it is done whenever the situation and necessity requires it, whether during the night or day, and at any hour and time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And it is not appropriate to perform phlebotomy on boys until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 A pregnant woman shall not be subjected to phlebotomy from the fourth month until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Elderly persons who have surpassed sixty years shall not be subjected to phlebotomy.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Therefore, when someone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for any reason, it is necessary that they clean their intestines before the procedure with a mild clisterium if there is much feces retained; so as not to attract unhealthy putrid waste from the intestines near the veins during the phlebotomy, harming the main organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 A patient suffering from toctina (satiation or nausea) shall not be subjected to phlebotomy; nor one who is intoxicated or drunk, until that condition has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 A person with dropsy should not be subjected to phlebotomy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And beware of phlebotomy after suffering from colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, or anything that weakens the body's strength in any way.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it can be done to him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter the bath, if it does not forbid him something: or exercise with some exercise, so that blood may be made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place phlebotomy in his chest on the third day, as we said before: and try to evacuate his chest that day with all its bad conditions such as tightness, anger, fear, and with all bodily conditions such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar ones.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him sit with those things present which custom of men has run with respect to aromatics, smell, joy and similar ones according to the possibility of quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit on the pulvinar that is higher than the phlebotomy pulvinar: then he should pull out his arm and rub it with his hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tie the ligature with a cord and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the ligature be moderate because when the ligature is uneven or too tight in the ligature, then it prevents the flow of blood; or in softening, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after the ligature it is necessary that the person to be bled rubs his hands together until the veins swell and are felt.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist cleans the puncture site with a little oil, old oil specifically.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then place the index finger of his left hand on that vein where he wants to do the phlebotomy a little bit, so that the vein does not escape and the blow is not scattered.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because veins are like fleeing cords during phlebotomy; and some of them are full of wind; and when you put the phlebotomy on it, it shrinks under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and he does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is narrowed; therefore for this reason it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm and attentive to all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then let him lay down (the) leeches.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If a vein is opened from one side (of the body), it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then repeat that with another side at that place or above it with haste; unless there is no need for cautery (cauterization).
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If (the vein) is cauterized or the sick person frightens, then let him go on the day or two days; and do not tie the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps it draws a boil hotly.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter (the) bathhouse.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then let him repeat the leeching, if (there is) blood (flow).
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or blood flows finely; and beware that the amount of blood does not leave what you want; then repeat the leeching in the same vein according to correctness, and add a little more in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do that with haste before cauterizing the place; because cauterized places are many among people during small operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you see that (the boil) is already cauterized, then do not repeat on it at all, because it does not excuse anything from you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And place something from oil paste on it; because it encourages the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And it is better in this place than oil itself and other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer oil paste in all your leeching of the veins, where leeches stop the flow of blood; and this is made by Tyriacans and Alfarachs, when it is put on one of them (the oils).
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 Blood becomes fine and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If it happens at the site of leeching that a large boil occurs, for it often happens, especially to him who is not a leecher except in that place or the opening of the vein is small; then hurry and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated a little; and tie it for an hour; because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 It is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, when it completes itself, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the place after several days of blackening or greening, it does not harm; and if you wish, place on top of it some alcohol, or myrrh dissolved; or something from the juice of mint, that is, camphor or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And often abscesses and protrusions occur at the phlebotomy of the basilica (large vein in the arm).
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Place your hand upon it (the abscess), then if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that protrusion is evil.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful, therefore, that you place something on it (the abscess) from what was said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood from the artery will flow out of it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make a plaster for it (the abscess) with that which contains the hardening substance, so that the place may become solidified.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it (the patient) with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 It is necessary that you draw out blood from every man according to the strength of its virtue (the power of the bloodletting instrument).
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a purple color above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp (acute), then let it flow out until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 It is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting to be done once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified, and that the bloodletter (the person performing the bloodletting) should be on the side; and for him who is weak, it should be the opposite.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 It is necessary that he draws it out at the veins and that there be a narrow hole: and it is better what is administered in venesection is, that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 This method of venesection is healthy against blood flow and nerve cut, and it is more commendable and safer than venesection by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 He who usually comes upon venesection with fainting, it is necessary that he be given small bread soaked in water of pomeranate juice or wine before venesection: or dried, if he is heated: and draw out from his blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If she is of cold constitution, then let her receive before venesection bread soaked in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey scented with spices, or in fragrant scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If fainting occurs during venesection and the cause is a large outflow of blood, then it is necessary that she drink meat water and subtle scented syrup: and use aromatics with algae, and let her be swaddled on her chest with this: and use the rest which we said in the division in the chapter on fainting from bleeding.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 He who wants to reduce his arm and release his blood in the second degree: it is necessary for him whose venesection is for great evacuation and whose strength is weak, that he releases blood gradually by the quantity of his strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But he who wants to reduce his arm and release his blood in the second degree and is obese: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine, from his first venesection.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But he who wants to draw blood from his body against the opposite part to which he leans: it is necessary that it be reduced to him on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body there is much heated blood, which becomes sharper and causes fever: it is necessary that blood should exit from him once, and a large quantity should be drawn out of him; and the opening should be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of venesection, and placed your hand over his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 Many times this happens when the venesectioner is unaware and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not appropriate when you wish to release the arm and draw blood a second time, if the orifice of the vein is already closed and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that one should press on it with force and the affected area be extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 For this is very bad indeed, rather let it go until it can be venesected a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Or remove with the sharpness of the venesectioner that which has congealed from blood in the vein's orifice and place something dissolved in salt water on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And put upon it some turmeric or alum, or sage root, and place it under gentle compression until blood exits.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if the vein has already been cut, then let it be and do not cover it up until the tumor settles down.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If necessity demands that blood be drawn a second time and there is no excuse, then either venesection should be done on the same spot, or on another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The band of the arm is venesected at the place of Fuscus and Basilicus, as they are not found and hidden because they are composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of venesection is that a weak hand should be inserted into warm water until it turns red and the vein appears clearly manifest.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then tie a moderately loose ligature over it.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then perform the venesection gradually, neither longitudinally nor transversely, but slightly curved; and let the opening be wide, and the incision for venesection be made near the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the flow of blood is prevented, then immerse the hand in hot water, and let the blood run into the water until your need is met.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 But if you are in summer days, then excuse yourself from immersing the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 Above all, it is advised to let the flow of blood run into hot water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 This venesection is safer than any other vein as it is neither artery nor nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 The venesection of the cephalic vein in the right hand is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 The quality of this venesection is that you should tie the cephalic vein with a ligature or your hand after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells up and becomes very sensitive.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then perform the venesection across [the vein].
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 Preserve, do not harm your hand with the venesection.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then immerse the hand again into hot water and let the blood run into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not immerse [the hand] in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein and prevent further flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 When you have extracted the required amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from coagulating quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is necessary that you do with every strict branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 The remedy for phlebotomy is from the left hand. Because it is akin to sickness of the spleen; and similarly do with phlebotomy as you did in the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The remedy for saphenous vein phlebotomy is for the sicknesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as the illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and the weaknesses of the kidneys, and ulcers of the hips and legs that are old, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of phlebotomy for this is that a weak person should immerse his foot in warm water; and make friction on it until the veins appear; and tie above the ankle joint with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 And indeed the location of the vein is at the heel, visible towards the thumb; and they branch out from it on the face of the foot in many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore phlebotomy should be done in a larger branch of it or at the heel in its gathering; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If phlebotomy is done on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your phlebotomy instrument as if you want to cut it transversely; and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If there is a prohibition of the outflow of blood, then immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the phlebotomist misses the vein in the first instance, then he should move it slightly upwards, because it is safer, and do not worry about ill-effects when you are careful of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is at the calcaneum side on the forest-side (lateral side).
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the aid of phlebotomy for it (the vein) is for pain in the ankle when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of phlebotomy for it (the vein) is that an invalid should enter the bath and hurry: and bind the leg from the side of the ankle up to the calcaneum four fingers, with thin ointment long: for it does not appear unless for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then phlebotomy should be done according to whatever skill is possible for you, or according to a crossing (transverse): and it is better, or as if you make an incision in it with an incision, or cut it with a section (ligature).
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 Its location is safer, and it is hidden very much in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it (the vein) and it does not appear at all to the sense: then phlebotomy should be done for one of its branches, and there is one that appears on the back of the foot, turned towards the ear: and be careful about nerves, and let the blood flow according to the amount you want.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then loosen the ligature, and place skin over the site of phlebotomy, and bind the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It is quickly cured.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On ventosation and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Bladders are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And bladdering is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With incision and bloodletting; and another kind of bladdering without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this kind of bladdering without incision is done in two ways as well.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is done with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is done without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the places in the body where bladdering with incision and bloodletting are administered are fourteen.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of them is the bladdering of Alnocrates, which is at the end of the head; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and the bladdering of Alhagdahim, which are two plates of the neck from both sides; and the bladdering of the mind, which is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the bladdering of the two spoon-shaped places; and the bladdering of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the bladdering of the two testicles, and they are in the middle of the arms; and the bladdering of the two legs; and the bladdering of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And bladdering indeed does not draw blood from the veins that are scattered throughout the flesh, and therefore it does not have the same effect as the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer bladdering whether with fire or without it in any disease that comes from congestion until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity requires bladdering due to a disease or custom, we administer it at the beginning of every month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 This is because there are some people who when their blood multiplies, until it requires extraction through bladdering, find a headache and pressure in their heads.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And from these (cases) is he who finds distention and redness on his face, on his head, and on his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And from these (cases) is he who finds itching on his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And from these (cases) is he who scratches a site of his wind-inflammation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And from these (cases) is he whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And from these (cases) is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or who spits out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And from these (cases) is he whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And from these (cases) is he who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the dead, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something from these (cases), and properly if it is during the third month (trimester): we then command that the wind-inflammation should be made, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The remedy for wind-inflammation of the neck is: because it (wind-inflammation) contributes to heaviness in the head and because it discharges to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 But indeed it must be that this (the wind-inflammation of the neck) is after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this (wind-inflammation) certainly is in the place of a cephalic phlebotomy (venesection).
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not allowed to use this (wind-inflammation) for one who has a cold constitution, or in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 Because it does great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of this (the great harm), it is not necessary for the elderly, and in one whose head there are cold diseases, to use this.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 He who frequently does it (wind-inflammation) generates confusion over him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of this (the confusion generated), it is necessary to command the wind-inflator to lower his hand with the wind-inflation a little towards the lower part, fearing from the generation of confusion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventosatio or Alkehel, is in place of the phlebotomy of Fuscus, and of the phlebotomy Basilicae, and for that reason it resembles coughing, constriction of breathing, fissure of instrument breathing, coughing, and filling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary that the Ventosatio Alkehel should be pushed a little, since if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventosatio alhagdahim, resembles pains in the head, migraines, ophthalmia, perforations, and pain in the roots of teeth: and is in place of the phlebotomy of Basilicae.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And it is necessary that you warn the Ventosator not to press his hand during scarification, so as not to cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventosatio however under the chin causes alcohol in the mouth and decay of gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth: and it remains in place of another phlebotomy which are on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventosation of spatulas causes alchafacham, which occurs from compression and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 However, the ventosation of the internal parts of two testicles gives help to the phlebotomy of the three veins: Basilica, Fuscus, and Cephalicus, since it attracts blood from all those fine veins that are in the flesh: and these fine veins attract blood from other larger ones until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And it is necessary that you warn the Ventosator not to proceed too far in scarification, since the place is stripped of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The ventosation that is done over alchausos causes hemorrhoids in the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary that you command the one who applies the cupping glass, that it should be a strong vacuum and that it should be made of glass: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the fine cups may break; and it shall be incised by large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The cups for the legs are diminished by obvious reduction: because they draw blood from the whole body, and they cause ancient pains in kidneys, uterus, and bladder; they provoke menstruation, and they cause swelling and water retention; and they stand at the place of phlebotomy for two saphena veins and alhorcoben.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and they cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the help of the cups for the legs is near to the help of the cups for two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the positioning of the cups is that you should place the cup first in an empty space, and suck with moderate suction; and do not prolong the positioning of the cups, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place at equal speed; and do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the place become red and swell, and the redness appears to be blood; then scarify, and continue with suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For the one who is from humans with soft flesh and rare pores, it is necessary to scarify him only once, not more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And command the one who applies the cupping glass, to enlarge the incision and not to dig too deep; and regulate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is thick blood in it, then it is necessary to scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first instance, the way for subtle bleeding and its thinning is opened, and in the second instance, an examination of a precise extraction of thick blood is performed.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If the blood is extremely foul, then make a third incision so that it may follow its course to the end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we wish to extract blood little by little or in small amounts, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to make a multiple extraction of blood, let there be many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to incise deeply, and the end of the incision in depth is equal to the thickness of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is that which should be administered from oils for the position of Ventosas (a surgical position), and what should be avoided in ventosing.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In a thick person with tough, dark skin and narrow pores, it is necessary to anoint the places for Ventosas with open, softening, resolving oils such as alkeiri oil or camphorated oil or sweet almond oil or cucumber seed oil during summer.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is winter, then use narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or soapwort, and similar.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If the superfluity is thick and cold, then use amaracus oil, or balm of Gilead oil, or white oil, or anise oil, and similar.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the ventoser has large pores and tender flesh, then it is necessary to prohibit oil and to wash the places for Ventosas with rose water, cold water, salty water, cucumber water, or portulaca water, and similar.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 The man whose blood is of great moistness, wash with vinegar or water of myrtle and sumach; and similar to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 Whose excretions are thick, wash the fecal matter with old wine or water of cumin, or a concoction of anise or chamomile; and similar to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 It is necessary to avoid fecal matter in the bath or near the bath, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour or two.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 Nor should anyone sleep after the fecal matter has been expelled.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 [paragraph: What is necessary to control Ventosandus or Phlebotomatus before fecal matter expulsion.]
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 [after it (the fecal matter expulsion) is necessary to consider first: if Ventosandus or Phlebotomatus is choleric and the sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood, then it is necessary that he receives cooling agents such as musk melon; also endive with vinegar and lettuce, secaniabin, and iuleb; and similar to these.]
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 [and place his food with young chickens, roasted mutton sheep, cooked foods with vinegar; and similar to these.]
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 [and for the one whose complexion is cold, it is necessary to drink syrup made from honey or almonds or secaniabin made from seeds; and drink moderately scented wine that is between old and new; and it should be prescribed that he eats sparingly.]
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 [and place his food with young chickens, roast capon; and sparrows, that is small birds; and quails (columba issidae)]
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 [and it is necessary that the drink on the day of fecal matter expulsion and venesection should be more than food; and it should be given in drink to certain people with tyriaca alfaroch or medicine made from musk (muscata), or aleselithe before fecal matter expulsion; and before or after venesection, in order to strengthen the main limbs and refine the blood.]
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 It is not fitting for them to take it in a warm drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 On wind-puffs without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Wind-puffs that are without incision are those placed upon the liver, spleen, podagra, abdomen, umbilicus, places of kidneys, and pox on the anus: because these members do not endure incision on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 Nor is it sought through them, unless it is an attraction from one member to another: just as we place the wind-puff on the breasts in the illness of flowing blood of the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissolve cold wind-puff in a member from a member: just as we place the wind-puff on the abdomen and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the member rarefied, and warms it up, and removes pain for this reason, because it dissolves that wind-puff.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 It is also placed upon the kidneys when there occurs obstruction or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By its virtue of attraction, perhaps it opens obstruction, or excavates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when it is placed upon the liver and spleen for crushing wind-puff in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These wind-puffs are administered empty, with incision only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in diseases of pleurisy: and this is, that the wind-puff should be filled with warm water alone, or water in which boiled herbs agree.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 On the form of a wind-puff administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Let the width of its orifice be two fingers open, according to what we have fashioned: and let its depth be half a palm: and there should be on its side in the place that is about the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into it with an awl: make it from brass, or citrine, of equal thickness, smooth, polished: so that it does not hurt the member under its position upon it: and let there be in its middle a crossbar transverse from brass or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now it becomes this swollen large one, greater than we have said, and somewhat smaller than that (one), according to the illnesses and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For boy's swellings and those of consumptives are different than man's swellings and fat bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this swelling with fire on a limb is to kindle a linen cloth or a small candle from wax and place it over the middle of the swelling that is in the middle of the swelling: so that the fire may be kindled around the lower part of the swelling, so as not to burn the body of the weak.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then place it on a limb: let the finger be over the opening which I said, until we hold the swelling: while we need to press, remove the finger, and the vapor will come out through that opening, and the swelling will immediately dissolve.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then kindle a linen cloth with fire according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In swellings that are administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar or opening: and it is not administered unless because it is filled with water, and placed on a limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this swelling, the larger it is, so that it can hold more water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on Suspension of Sanguesugars.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Sanguesugars are not administered in many places except where the position of swellings is not possible due to their small size, such as the lips, gums, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or in a naked member without flesh, such as fingers, nose, and similar areas.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is: that you come from Sanguesugs which are in sweet waters, clean of decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then let them be kept day and night in sweet water until they are hunger-stricken, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 The body should first be evacuated with phlebotomy and cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then clean the sick member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Place them on top of it afterwards.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are full and fall down, and it is possible to extract the juice of the place with cupping, then it is more beneficial for healing; if not, then clean the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then wash it with much water, rub it, and squeeze it out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the flow of blood persists after bleeding due to Sanguisugum (leech), it should be removed by dipping a piece of linen cloth into cold water and placing it on top until the drainage stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood multiplies, then sprinkle powdered zega (calamine), oyster shells, and similar substances derived from chalkstone on it until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place halved and peeled fava beans on the spot, leaving them until they adhere to the location; for the blood is drained away as the beans stick.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary that if repeated bleeding with Sanguisugum (leech) is required, to change them when possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If leeches are forbidden from being suspended, then clean the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or insert a needle into the spots until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them, for they will stick as soon as they feel some blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 Whenever you want them to fall, sprinkle something from crushed aloes, salt or ashes on them; they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 § Second Part Ends.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Chapter III of the Surgical Book of Albucasis begins here.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Discourse on restoration, dislocation, and treatment of torsions, and similar matters.
Caput I.	 De causa torsionis, et quibus partibus corporis apud homines frequenter accidit.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is often necessary in the art of Medicine; it is a restoration of broken bones and dislocations of joints.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know ye, O sons, that foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method is lacking among the known people of our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never come across a good example of this method, nor have I mastered it except for the length of reading ancient books and my persistence in understanding them until I extracted knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I attached myself with determination and diligence throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 Now I have explained to you all that my knowledge contains about this chapter: and whatever my experience exceeds, after abridging it for you, and liberating it from the constraints of length, and abridging it to the point of abridgement, and showing it to the point of clarification: and I formed many shapes of instruments used in it, since it involves addition, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summary and collections of fractures in bones, from which a premise is necessary before we begin the remembrance of the broken limbs, and of various ones, if of each.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary to say in the preamble of this chapter the main topics and headings, to which understanding is essential for the craftsman on the truth of them: namely, so that you, and those who are quick to learn, may know or learn this noble art from each other.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say then that when a fracture or dislocation, or twist, or fall happens to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him and dissolve it, or both at the same time: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of power; or it is a child who has happened to one of these things, or an old man weakened; or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, onions, and beans; and forbid wine, fatty meats, and filling with foods and all food that fills veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until he is safe from a hot purge and is not afraid of the flow of matter to a limb; then let the sick one return to his own diet first with which his habit was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When a broken bone begins to heal, then the sick one should be fed with nourishing foods in large amounts, heavy and thick ones, with viscosity; such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads of cattle, feet, livers of sheep, eggs, fresh fish; also thick wine and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 For this regimen makes the setting of the fracture faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that fractured bones, in men who are in the first age of old age and decrepit, it is not possible to be held together and consolidated according to their nature always, due to the drying of their limbs; they consolidate and hold together those which come from them at the end of gentleness, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to glue around the fractured bone from every part, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens it until they are consolidated together, and bound together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prohibit it from its operations; and for this reason, it is necessary to place the nourishment of the sick with foods that have thickness, viscosity, and heaviness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs; since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the backbone; and similarly all other limbs are different from each other; and I come with the reminder of all the species of fractures exposed in their respective chapters.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The species of bone fracture are also diverse within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since the fracture of it is arched, in addition to which stars occur within it. (The 'it' refers to the bone.)
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture of it occurs along the length of the bone: there are fractures called stars, that is, astellae, and extensions arising from them, such as in a reed when it is sharpened with a knife to write. (The 'it' refers to the bone.)
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not extending: and there is a fracture with a wound and splitting at the head, and it is a small split fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every kind has its skill or appropriate tool for its restoration, according to the memory of it, divided in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from the fact that a bone fracture is known, its curvature and protrusion appear, and its appearance becomes noticeable to the sense, and its sound when it is compressed by your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 Therefore, if there is no apparent curvature in its place, nor a sound when you touch the bone with movement, nor does it cause a strong pain to the affected person: then there is no fracture there, indeed it may be a curvature or a small split fracture: therefore, do not move or compress it completely by hand, instead lay medicines on it whose memory comes to mind, after the appropriate time: then it should be bound with a narrow bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that if the place is arched and split into two, in addition to which stars occur within it, however, all parts are moved away from their origin: then you must begin from your hour for its correction, aligning it before a warm abscess occurs on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If, however, a warm abscess occurs on it, then allow it to be for some days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then, cut it equally according to whatever manner can be done with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that its restoration and equalization is easier than the bone, wherein complications occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then bind it, according to whatever recollection comes to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If there are complications in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from both parts, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 Let your position be such that you place the member on a level surface according to its natural shape, until the parts of the broken member extend; then try with all your skill and ability to bring back these additions in their places: and be careful not to cause pain or injury by your operation, nor damage; and try with all your strength to apply one bone to its companion, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 It is necessary that at that time you try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If then you see something unusual there, correct it, and adjust it to an equal state according to your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For many times they cause abscesses or contractions in the member through their operation, as we have already seen from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then join after adjustment and proper operation, and binding of this member, and rest, and calmness; and warn the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And let him take care not to move it during the time of his vigils, and sleep, during his turning and agitation, and during his hunger, and all its movements with utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And so that it may be avoided, let there not be a position of a member followed by pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 Whenever one feels pain or injury in the position of a member, it is then necessary that you change its position to another where there will be no pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And be careful that its position is equal and straight, so that there does not occur a twisting in the member when it is being restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of the binding for the broken member, as I have told you.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that the broken members are classified according to their size and magnitude, and also by their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those that are small, such as the arm, the finger, the toe, and similar to these, then it is necessary that there be a soft, delicate wrapping of cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 But those that are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary that there be a broad, hard wrapping for them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because a wide binding holds together a large member and compresses it equally from all sides with an equal pressure, thus preventing any spot from being infected.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then, after your evacuation, begin to place the appropriate poultice on it in a soft woolen cloth over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wrap the binding over the site of the fracture three or four times, according to what is deserved by the member; and bind your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go to the upper part away from the site of the fracture and bind it less than your previous binding that you used on the fractured site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then pull the wrapping away from the site of the fracture slightly and soften the binding gradually until you take a large amount from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another poultice and wrap it again over the fractured site with more wrappings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Advance with a reduction towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 Let your operation be in the constriction of the reduction and its softening, according to what we said in the first reduction above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the reductions from soft linen cloth or fabric that matches the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then reduce over another piece of meat.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place evenly stars well made astels immediately over these reductions, if there is no swelling or warm abscess in that place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is a swelling or abscess in that place, then place over it what sits on that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then tie over these stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 Let the stars be from the middle parts of wide reeds, shaved and shaped wisely; or they may be made of wood from which cribra are made, namely pine or oak, or calingi; and let the width of each star be in this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 Nevertheless, the star that is placed over the traction should be somewhat larger and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to what is possible for the member due to its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then tie over the stars with another piece of meat, according to the first reduction.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then tie on top with cords evenly, according to what we said about the reduction; and let your reduction over the fracture be more; and the greater the distance from the fracture, the smaller the reduction.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 It is necessary that the cords be medium in thickness and fineness, and be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 If threads are thick, as I saw from the operation of foolish people who place their threads twisted from horsehair strings, it is a great error: because the constriction falls out with them beyond quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 Fine threads do not suit again: since you will not achieve with the constriction what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not suitable that there be less than a finger's breadth between the needle and the embroidery.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If a sick person is harmed by the tips of the embroidery after a constriction at healthy places: then place under them from soft wool or camel's-hair wool until nothing is harmed from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a fracture with a wound, and a break occurs in the skin, I will come with a reminder of this in Chapter 2 under special cases.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken member must be sutured with needles from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 It is because when a member is large, it is not necessary to place the threads above until five days or seven or more, according to your safety from the occurrence of an abscess of heat.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 This is the method of plasters, which the ancients placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 Shortened common method of plasters, restoring a fracture, suitable for multiple constitutions, particularly women and children: since it is from that which heat does not prevail, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is to receive from the flour mill dust, and it is the marrow of the wheat that hangs in the walls of the mill near the motion of the millstone: and make this as it is, except you sift it with egg white: and place the mixture of it not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of plasters, restoring a fracture, dislocation, and twisting.

Prepare alms (almess), laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath. Crush all of them together, sift, and mix with twenty times the amount of myrrh, five times the amount of aloes, and twenty times the amount of alethil. Or mix with sheep's white grease if the patient's condition is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then apply this poultice.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For this is a good composition, it restores broken bones quickly and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of poultice for fractures and dislocations.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Prepare mugath, mess, white alteae, all of them crushed together with ten times the amount of myrrh, five times the amount of aloes, six times the amount of acacia, twenty times the amount of Armenian pounded berries, and grind them well. Then sift and boil in water or sheep's white grease. Administer them.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of poultice for unions and bones separated from their places. It relieves pain in those places, cuts, and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take boiled wool, immerse it in vinegar and cooked oil, then place it on the location.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 In this poultice there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for the sedation of hot abscesses and it drives out pains specifically.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method of poultice that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take the leaves of wild fig and papaver (opium poppy) and grind them all together to make a poultice from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Another short method of poultice for restoration of bone fractures and when you wish resolution of remaining abscesses.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Prepare the root of alteae (althea), camomilla (chamomile), flowers of viola (violet), and herb flour, all in equal parts. Crush them all and boil with wine if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated (the wound), then make that (compress) with water of coriander boiled, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger method of plaster for resolution, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess happens during restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Prepare the root of althea, linseed seed, boxwood, lentil, samphire, violets flowers, chamomile, all crushed equally, grind everything, and make it with water of willow, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply the entire thing according to the heat of the member, and the quietness of its warmth.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that it should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration unless it is made of wax and oil: nothing else: and he narrated that it should be of a medium between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen, however, considered that things containing heat-dissipating properties should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and similar substances from those we mentioned earlier.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method of plaster for injury and pain relief.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Prepare mugath, chickpea, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, althea, and salt in equal parts: crush them, sift them, and make a plaster out of it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The amount by which the bandage should remain, then be loosened, is such that you consider it: if no weak pain or itching occurs, nor does the broken bone move from its place: then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If itching occurs intensely at the site, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then go and loosen it within an hour, and remove the plaster from there: and take a soft cloth or sponge, wet with warm water, and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain settles.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the member rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Place upon it a piece of scented linen, soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil; bind over it at night until you are confident that the hot inflammation has subsided, and let the swelling of the member rest, and remove its pain.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then return to the delicate tightening and a small plaster; do not bind it tightly at first with your tightening, but apply delicate ones until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all signs of inflammation have completely disappeared and you need a plaster and tightening, then do so as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing from what we said occurs in the member, then do not loosen it before three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is allowed for twenty days as appears to you from the resolution of the member, as we said, until when a fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh attaches to it; add also more in tightening than your first entire tightening; add also in the thickening of weak food, according to its preceding memory.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see the location of the fracture has already dried out and weakened more than it should; then know that nutrition is prohibited from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore pour warm water over the entire place where you loosen it, and let this be in all three days; relieve the tightening a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this operation, nutrition reaches the member and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 That which foolish restorers do in place of a fracture of the member when it is not restored first, as required, and restored according to twists, is an error from their operation, and great fear; and if it were correct, they would have said this in their ancient books and operated accordingly.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have not seen anywhere their trace in it at all, and it is more correct that it is not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 On the making of a head wound.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 The types of fractures are diverse and their shapes are many; the causes of them are differentiated.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For from the fracture is that which occurs by blow with a sword; and the blow removes bone completely until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, as does an axe in wood, and for this reason this type of fracture is called Axial Fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword strikes something of the bone and cuts its face, but does not penetrate through the cut to the end of it; and this type of fracture is called Calaan, that is, an Absolute Shatter.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there is a wound for two types of fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from the fracture is that which is compression or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this type of fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the padding (which is under the bone), or it is on the face of the bone; and it is a wound for these two types of fractures and it can be either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of hair; and it is a small crack, and for this reason this type of fracture is called Capillary Fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And from these [fractures] is a fracture that occurs from a fall or blow by a stone and similar things, which cause the lamina (plate) of the bone to enter the interior, and it forms an indentation; as happens with caldrons of brass when they are struck, and part of them enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 Most certainly it happens that way in moist bones, such as those of children's heads.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these types of fractures of the sternum are separated, and I will come with the recall of the whole one in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we recognize all these types of fractures by examination over it and investigation of them with the probing sticks, and removal of corrupted flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The Capillary type is recognized by this: that it protrudes over the bone and is scraped off and burned with a branding iron; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of fractures, consider first the state of the patient: then if you see from the conditions that it indicates fear, as for example cholera vomiting, stretching, loss of intellect, disappearance of voice, fainting, acute fever, eye problems, redness of eyes and similar ones from other conditions in various dispositions, without doubt it will not heal: and if you see the conditions that do not frighten you and hope for health: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If a wounded person comes to you first with the wound: and this is during winter days, then it is necessary that you should study the removal of the bone before the 14th day in every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is during the summer days, then it is necessary that you rush to remove the bone before the 7th day, before what is under the bone from the flesh corrupts, and those conditions occur that we mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the bone fracture has already reached the flesh touching the brain and is accompanied by minute particles and attraction: then it is necessary that you cut the crushed and smoothed part, according to what I told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is that you shave the head of the wounded person: and scrape over the bone according to whatever method is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If it happens to you during the discovery of a bone that there is bleeding or a warm abscess, then apply what is necessary to it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And fill the place with linen soaked in wine and rose oil, let the wound rest until the abscess settles down, and be cautious of bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is to cut the bone with a straight-edged saw and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 And then administer another saw, broader by a little, after the first one: and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then also administer yet another saw wider still than that.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you have a number of different saws; some of which are wider than others, and some narrower; and let them be at the sharpest edge of their extremities, and made of Indian iron or copper; and use them with ease in striking upon the saw, so as not to fracture the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard, then it is necessary to bore around it before you administer the saws with drills called trebrirs, which are not deep-drilling; and they are called thus because they do not pass through the bone into the meat that is behind it; for this reason, the end of a trebrid is rounded above what is under its head, sharp at the bottom like an edge or small circle, preventing immersion and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is fitting that you take a number of trebrirs from among these, each one appropriate to the thickness of the bone until you have before you all the trebrirs for every bone; whose sharp ends in length and width are according to the thickness of the said bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of drills or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality for perforating around the bone of a broken limb is as follows: place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that it has already penetrated the bone.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the drill to another position and place a rod of size equal to the diameter of a finger or approximately there in every hole.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the chisels what is between every hole in the bone and do it more finely than you can on that part of the surface as we have said until you have removed the bone or by hand, or with some other instruments which you prepared for this purpose such as tenons and fine forps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And you must be careful to avoid touching the drill or chisels with any part of the splinter.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you perforate around the bone and it is separated from the splinter, if it is continuous with it and you extract it, you must plane and smooth the end that remains in the bone with another similar chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 Nevertheless, it should be thin and delicate more than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If some small bones or splinters remain, take them out easily with the tool you have on hand.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then take care of the wound after that with linen and the unguents as mentioned before.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of operation is simple, far from fear; which Galen described and praised highly; and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 First, you must begin to expose the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and clearer until when you have exposed that part and placed under it the end of this concave chisel, which has this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the concave part of the lens, smooth, does not cut anything; and the sharp part of it, in its two sides, extending along its length as you see: so that the concave part of the lens is fixed to the siphoid, with its sharp end incident upon the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike upon the Incisorium with a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone easily, as is customary; and be careful that no part of the linen cloth, which you fear might slip, should come into contact with it.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the healer were not more foolish than men, and less ignorant of his art, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the linen cloth in certain places, it would be cut away by the sharp end of the incisorium lenticularis itself, and would free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the linen cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is the surface of it, and roughnesses and subtle shavings remain in it: then you should plane away that roughness, and grind out those subtle shavings with finer scrapers which you have prepared for this purpose, so that you may be able to administer them more conveniently and more correctly at every place according to what the operation requires, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And you should administer it according to your judgment, by first planing the bone more widely with those scrapers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease doing this in continuity until you reach administering it more thinly and more finely of all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In each of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a thing that cannot be concealed over all, to which in this art there is any study, and it stood on what we have written, and it was shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If the flap is adhered and retained when you excavate the bone: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another piece of cloth doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place it over the first cloth; and do that as easily as possible over it, so that it is not too heavy on the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer a broad ligature over it; and do not tighten it, unless by the amount that holds the wound only; and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are secure from hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it, and administer afterwards medicines with which excessive dryness is superfluous; such as the roots of garlic, and the flour of herbs, and the powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar ones; and it is to be made from these medicines a powder that will be sprinkled over the wound like dry ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And administer universally in it every medicine of the property which is to cleanse and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your virtue that the wound in your cure is clean; and let there not be dirt of ointment in it, nor filthiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Do not leave the wound to collect pus in it at all; because when pus gathers on the brain cloth, it corrupts it and makes it putrefy, and afterwards a great mischief happens on the weak person after that; and it already happens in the head of the wound, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when the care of it is neglected, the blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 If the ailments mentioned occur in the sick person, know that it is certainly fatal.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 If the discoloration does not occur except from the medicine applied on him, and it is within the power of that medicine to cause the discoloration: then, take a part from honey and three parts from rose oil, and wash with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then lay him on a sow's bladder; afterwards care for him with appropriate medicines until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the Repair of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except when both of its upper parts are broken simultaneously or only one of them: because there are two bones in it; since below it is cartilaginous and does not break, but instead, it is subject to attrition, curvature, and deviation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert a small finger into the nose opening, and straighten the fracture with your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; do this carefully with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And beware that you do not cause pain during the operation on the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and a finger cannot reach it: then, straighten the tip of the radius that has a small bulge.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in both parts, then do the same: and approach with the repair on the first day of the fracture if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, in a warm room of sweat baths.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a piece of linen cloth from a flaxen cloth into the tip of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pieces of linen cloth if the fracture is in both parts: and let there be a thickness in the cloth equal to the size that fills the nose opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the ancient restorers said to infuse linseed in butter and change it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 That does not seem right to me, rather it is necessary for linseed to be infused into butter made from milk, with flour of the mill ground.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then let the linseed be removed when the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes hard.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And at times a feather of a goose is inserted into the nose instead of linseed, once it is covered by soft cloth; and this makes the broken nose hold more tightly, so as not to hinder the sick from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do it; and if you want, do it with linseed.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose happens to develop an abscess again when treating it with a lancet, pack the nose with hot plasters, or with plaster soaked in rose oil, or with a little javelin juice.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if an abscess does not develop, then pack it with plasters made from flour of sesame and incense powder mixed with butter of milk.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft wadding over it, but do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the nose bones are broken slightly or crushed, then it is necessary to cut through them and remove them with instruments suitable for that purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then let it heal by itself and take care of it with suitable plasters or ointments for that purpose.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If an injury occurs between the nostrils, then treat it with linseed; and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the repair of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken and there is no wound associated with it; then observe if the break is on the outside only and not split into two, and if it bends towards the inside; then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if there is a fracture on the right part, introduce the left index finger into the bone of the weak: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the right index finger: and push with it the swelling of the fracture towards the outside with ease using your other hand from the inside part of the bone correctly, and with it equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary that you administer an extension from both sides, according to rightness: until it is possible for its equalization.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If however it has already happened that the teeth are moved or dislocated: then bind them with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place on the fractured jaw a piece of wood.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place on it a double cloth and on the cloth place a large cross, well made: or an equal fragment of shoe leather, in length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above, according to the preparation of its binding and the fitting of its application, until it is not destroyed: and order the sick one to rest calmly and quietly: and place his food as softened.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you estimate that something has changed in its shape by some means: then rush and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been changed from it and plaster it with lime made from millstone powder, with egg white, or with sifted flour, after you have removed the wood: and place over the plaster a soft woolen cloth.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While the plaster remains attached to it on top and the bone arrangement does not change, leave it as it is, without loosening it, until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is frequently tightened within three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If during that time a hot abscess occurs, then administer the remedy we have said multiple times for its suppression until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, be mindful of it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 If it is already separated from the bone as a shard or splinter, then apply delicacy to this matter, so that you remove those shards of splinters together with what suits you for their removal using the appropriate tools.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If, however, the wound opening is constricted, then expand it with a leech according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you remove the splinters and nothing remains of them, or if the wound opening is wide: and if not, place on it a dressing that suits for this purpose and let it heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Chapter on repairing a fork when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The fork is broken most often from the front part by the shoulder and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it breaks and splits into two, besides the fact that shards may occur in it: and it is easier to repair this type of fracture.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or such that splinters occur in the bone: and it is more difficult to repair this type of fracture.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or when the fracture occurs with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation in this case when there is no wound, is to have two assistants present, one of whom holds the broken fork and the other stretches the neck towards the broken part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then bend the fracture with your fingers until the shape is formed as it should be: and there should not be a prominence or hollow in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you require further extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's wound ball made of cloth or wool; and let its size be according to your need; and extend and lift up the lever, and shape the ball with your hand until it matches the fracture, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the extremity of the lever outside, because it has reached deep: then the patient should lie on his neck; and place under his shoulder a beam of appropriate size; and press the minister (assistant) to push down on the patient's upper arm until the bone of the lever that is in deep rises upwards; and then straighten the fracture, and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel a splinter in the lever and it moves: then it is necessary that you apply pressure on it and easily extract the splinter.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it is retained in the bone, then heat the incision with one of the instruments you have prepared for this purpose, after you place under the lever the tool that keeps the splinter (sifach); and the tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a snail shell without a hollow cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to the bone you need it for and its size.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length, however, should also be as possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it should have two ends, as you see; and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If the break in the wound that you made when you extracted the splinter of bone is wide and you are afraid of infection from heat: then gather the lips of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the break is small or you fear hot infection: then fill the wound with cloth and wool according to the size of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If a hot boil occurs, then pour linen into rose oil, vinegar, and wine on it, and place it upon it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 However, a fracture of the bone without wound or incision is such that you place plaster on the bone made from milled flour and egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place soft wool upon it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a small sphere under the affected area if needed.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a leech, that is, the round one held by Saracens, which should be very long: and its width should be the size of one palm or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a double layer of wool over the soft wool and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take an awl from fine wood, whose width is three fingers, and likewise in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then insert it into a linen cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then insert the linen cloth with the awl at the place of the leech that falls on the fracture and the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the leech on the fracture as it is rolled [around], and insert it over its neck, at the healthy end and at the weak end: and bring it over all parts, so that you see that the leech holds the fracture properly: this is what is meant by a suitable leech for a fracture, and it should not be concealed beneath you nor removed from above the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And therefore, one must look at the weakened part every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 How often then is the ligament softening and you see the leech being removed? Then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick person's pillow under his back, and place a small cushion under his head at night, so that when he is raised from one side, assistance may be provided to him from the other side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Fracture of the neck (of the clavicle) is to be treated by lifting (the arm).
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Either tie the arm to the neck itself and do not loosen the bandage unless it happens in a place that is affected by itching or from a boil, for twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see its face (the wound) at that place.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add a string and let it be until it heals and coagulates.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 Indeed, a fracture of the neck (of the clavicle) is to be bound and strengthened as much as possible for twenty-eight days; sometimes it happens in some people in lesser time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the healing of a clavicle fracture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Clavicles rarely break, and when they do, it is at a wide place; however, only the edges break from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When the clavicle breaks at that place and splits in half, it can only be known by touching; then prepare for its treatment according to its shape (of the fracture).
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 Restore it to its natural shape in any way possible that is within your ability.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on the site a flour of milling with egg white, and soft wool, and cover it with a small cloth (doubled).
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on top of it a wide bandage made from thin wood, according to the size of the clavicle or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If there is a hollow under the bandage at any place on the clavicle, then fill that hollow with soft wool until the bandage descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then bind it tightly on top with long thread, in a suitable constriction and the firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 Check the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the ligament is softened, tie it and if the awl is removed from its place, let the weak one lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And the spatula is restored within twenty days or within twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When that number is completed, then untie the ligament; and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is from bones whose fracture is not feared nor their dislocation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If the splinter comes out of a bone and pierces beneath the skin, then cut through it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we said for a broken neckbone with abscess from hot poultice, if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a breastbone fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 A breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle of it and it happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities indeed break more often and are usually crushed from accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When the middle of it breaks and inclines towards the lower parts, pain is caused that is intense, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and perhaps vomiting blood, and a hollow is noticed on the broken bone which is not hidden from sensation, restoration of it is for the weak one to lie on his back and place a splint between its blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press the arms and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with the hands: and to smooth it out in its place, as far as possible, until the shape of the bone returns as necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place on it a plaster and wool, and place above it an awl made of thin wood or ivory, or similar materials wrapped in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then smooth it out on the bandage over the broken bone to prevent removal: and walk with the bandage according to its roundness towards the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable strap.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the suture at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it. And if its necessity provokes its solution due to itching, or corrosion occurring in the location, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and solve it, remove the plaster, and correct what happens with this treatment's method.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Apply the plaster to it if you see that it is necessary: and bind a ligature to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 On the Restoration of Broken Ribs.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the breaking of ribs does not occur except in thick places that follow the back and from their extremities from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it does not happen to them by friction, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of this [fact] is not hidden from the sense during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And the restoration of [the broken rib] is done in such a way that it is brought together with fingers according to the possible method, until it becomes equal to its shape as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the broken rib is oblique towards the inside: then a strong pain occurs to the weak, and puncture, like the puncture that happens to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and it also occurs that there is difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood many times; and this is difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have been skilled in this with many skills; and among them are those who say that you should put weak foods which generate inflammation and gas, so that the stomach becomes inflamed, extended, and pushed outwards to move the break towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We strongly disapprove that a cause for making a hot abscess should occur, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If it has already happened, then add [something] to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: Place a bladder on the spot, then squeeze gently, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 Nevertheless, there is fear that a bladder may attract superfluities to the spot due to its weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: The spot should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil; and the bladders should be placed between the Costal muscles until it is filled; so that the ligature is equal when it is tied around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person is treated with a cure of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If a violent remedy tightens the sick person beyond his tolerance and pierces his flesh with a sharp lancet, causing fear over the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we place on it an instrument that preserves the syringe, whose memory has come before; and we make a small cut in the bone with ease, and make the same cut.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we gather together two lips of the wound if it is large with stitches; and treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If a hot abscess should happen meanwhile, then hurry and pour bladders into rose oil, and place them on the spot; and the sick person is to be treated with what is appropriate for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Also, a mattress may be placed over the side where he sleeps until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Chapter on the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fractures of the neck bones sometimes occur, and they rarely happen due to rubbing; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When therefore it happens to someone and you wish to know whether they will be healed or not, then examine (or consider).
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 If you see his hands already softened, paralyzed and dead; and he cannot move them, extend them or contract them; and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it nor feels pain in them, then know that he will not be healed and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels the pressure with his fingers and pricking, then know that the neck bone is safe, and that the sick person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it happens to the spine similar to that and you wish to know whether it will be healed or not, then examine his feet; then if you see that they have become softened and the same thing has happened to them as in the hands; furthermore, when he lies on his back, pus and foul-smelling discharge appear without his will; and when he lies on his stomach, discharge appears without his will; and when he lies on his back and wants to urinate, but cannot, then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, do not exert yourself in treating him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if nothing of that kind happens to him, it is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for that which happens to him is to apply warm poultices: thus, you should place a smooth surface of rose oil on the spine; or with goose grease that has been heated.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on the same place several times a day until the warm poultice soothes the abscess; then place one of the comforting, drying and binding plasters over that location, and bind it tightly with a bandage; and instruct the sick person to rest quietly and tranquilly.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He should not sleep on the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens during the fracture of a bone and something separates from it, then one must detach it above the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then bring together two edges of the wound, if it is large, with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with some ointment until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the last bone of the alhausos is broken and it is at the end of the tail: then one must insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus and press the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible according to its position and in accordance with the second adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then lay him on his side and remove it (the bone): and take care of the wound as before with the previous treatment until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Chapter on Restoring an Anus.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rarely are the bones of the anus broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they are broken, then the fracture is not complete but only a comminution at their extremities: and they are cut lengthwise and bend towards the inside; and there occurs weakness in the place and puncturing pain; and the leg that is broken becomes paralyzed.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the restoration of it (the anus) is to stretch your hand over it until you feel the shape of the fracture.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its extremities, then adjust that fracture according to the preparation made for you from the adjustment, until it becomes similar to its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is in length or it bends towards the inside, then make the weak person lie on his stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have adjusted it (the bone), place an ointment on it; then place a splint made of wood or hide over it and tie a binding over it where you are not afraid of displacement of the fracture or removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And make the concavity of those (objects) equal to that which fills it, until it is taken by the ligature, according to equality; and order the sick person to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If however it happens to him that an abscess is hot: then cease from extending it and its healing, until the abscess becomes hot; and place on what sits the abscess, as before, then return to its healing; and tie it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If however it happens to a bone that it is fractured or crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the healing of a fracture.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The Adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of a splint.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it (the bone) breaks, then its healing is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One method is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, in the following shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And tie two ligaments at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place: and the sick man shall sit on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then let him cast his broken arm upon a stick, until it reaches the knob of that stick, at which point a wound is fixed to the middle of the stick.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then hang something heavy over him so that his servant may pull him downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the doctor sets the fracture by hand, until it returns to its proper position.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another method is that the sick man lies on his back: and hang his hand from his neck with a rope.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then order two servants that one of them shall hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other shall hold below it, and each of them shall pull towards their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with a rope, and above it with another rope: and each of the two servants shall pull towards their respective sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If then the fracture is near to the shoulder, it is necessary that a rope be placed under the knob, and another one below the fracture facing the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the fracture is near to the elbow, it is necessary that a rope be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then straighten the fracture with ease and without effort until it is even according to its proper position, and apply a good binding: then bind it, if there is no risk of a hot abscess.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if there is a hot abscess, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place on him a shredded wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess settles down: then bind it; and the method of binding is to apply a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place an inversion from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then bring the arm upon the aid itself and put one's open hand on one's own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And place the cloth and bind the arm upon the aid so that the arm remains in the position of a star: if it does not prevent you from doing something or if anything from the broken bone alters over you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you fear that something from the broken bone will alter over you, then use stars: and there is one to place above the fracture itself a star which is wider and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And you will place between every star a space of a digit's width: and the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with an addition of three digits from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind on the stars with the suture as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And there is one for your suture to be over the fracture site tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as the fracture becomes longer, let the suture be smaller.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of the stars and the suture as we said, in the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do it: and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the suture and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligament for three days so that there does not occur at the site itching, swelling or food is prevented from reaching the member due to the accumulation of excess suture.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore correct all this as we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If you are confident that nothing bad will happen from it: then do not loosen the ligament unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 Let the sick person lie with his back on it and put his hands on his abdomen: and place a blanket full of wool under the aid equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Consider at every hour of the night or day that the shape of a fractured member is not dissolved and that the ligament does not soften.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct it therefore with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Therefore, place the food of the sick according to the order that we have prescribed, so that it is a delicate food first, until the bone begins to bind; then it is necessary that you increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For it is the custom of assistance and limb that it should be bound for forty days; then therefore it is necessary that it is untied, and a bath is given, and it is treated with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, scratch it; then do not untie the ligament and remove the splints until fifty days have passed, and two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on Restoring a Fractured Arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is made up of two bones, which are called the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small; it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is the one placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Perhaps therefore the larger humerus is broken alone, or perhaps both are broken.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 If the smaller humerus is broken at the top, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And if the larger humerus is broken from below, the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse when both bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller humerus at the top, then it is suitable for the doctor in its restoration to place a smaller splint with ease until it has reached an equal level.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If however the larger humerus is the one that is broken; then it is necessary to place a strong splint very tightly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary that the figure of the hand be placed at its restoration, and the extension itself extended upon the palm.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers: and the lower joint (of the thumb) should be higher than all the other joints (or remaining ones): and the weak one sitting square upon itself, and let the palm be before it, or in its direction, at a height so that the weak one does not strain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then the assistant shall extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant shall extend (it) above in the same way.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician adjusts the bone until he brings it back to its best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are pus-like substances in the bone fracture, then try to reduce all the fragments to their proper place by your own strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If it appears that there is a piece of pus separated and pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then cauterize over it, and remove it according to the method we have mentioned in those (instructions) that precede.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If there is a fracture with an open wound, I have already written a special chapter for it, so take care of that from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then soak a linen cloth with wax made from rose oil, white beeswax, and of an intermediate consistency: and tie the cloth over it with a fine thread until the abscess subsides: then remove the wax and place the prepared plaster made from flour mill powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place the splint, and let the splint that is placed over the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether there is a fracture in one splint, or in two splints at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your ligature over the stronger and more forceful part of the fracture, and a little further along with the ligature towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards the lower part: or place a softer ligature over its corresponding part, according to what was previously remembered in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the cloths wrapped around the fracture be soft, moist; and they should not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 Let the thread used for ligature be of moderate thickness, neither too thin nor too thick, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Examine the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens requiring correction, such as itching in the limb: then it is necessary to anoint the limb with warm embrocation until the itching stops, and release the unconstricted limb until it stops, then reapply the ligature.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the ligature has already been softened and the bone already removed, and similar cases: then correct it all with your power, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the ligature, then it is necessary to soften it a little and release it for some days until it reaches the same nourishment, then re-ligate it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if none of the ailments mentioned occur to the weak person, then it is not necessary to release it unless after twenty days or about that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hand of the weak person should be suspended on his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be kept straight and protected from excessive movements with your power.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 Know that this fracture heals within thirty or thirty-two days; and it may perhaps heal within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 The entire thing is according to the dispositions of temperaments, and the dispositions of virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 On the restoration of broken hands.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that scissors-hands and finger knots rarely occur fracture.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It does not happen to him, unless it is rubbed many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When then the fracture of the hand occurs or through rubbing, it is necessary that the patient be seated in a chair with an equal height before him.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 The assistant then extends the broken bones, and adjusts them so that the physician can join them with good union when they are united.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place a plaster and wool, if there does not occur a hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place the splint on it according to the size of the place; and you have already wound it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the fracture is at the bottom near the foot of the hand, then make a splint similar to a sphere from cloth; and command the patient to bend over it with the fractured hand; then sew it together with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be made of parchment, with a softness that the skin of the foot can be applied to it; and sew it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place a splint over it and another one under the foot; and the hand should be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then put the strap, as the hand turns out; and extend it between the fingers with a lace.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If a fracture occurs in any finger knots, then if it is the thumb, it should be adjusted as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then sew it with the foot; and if there are wounds, place a straight splint under it to raise the fracture and prevent movement.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is of the middle finger, thumb, little finger, ear-lobe or ring finger, then it should be splinted and tied to the healthy finger following it; or all should be tied according to their sequence; and it is best.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Place a small splint upon it (the fracture), as we said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration (of the fracture), and after its arrangement apply a warm plaster; and compare it with what is required, whenever something happens from that (the fracture), according to what its narrative repeats.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Hip Fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hip bone is often broken and made evident to the sense; because it is turned towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration (of the hip bone fracture) is done by tying a ligament above the fracture and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And the sick person lies on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then extend all the serving ligaments to their respective parts according to equality; and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then let a ligament be to the part of the pelvis, so that the extension falls upward; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then let a ligament be near the knee so that the extension falls downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician straightens the bone with his hands until he reduces it to its original shape; and joins the bone by a good union (of bones).
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you apply plaster and binding, if an abscess does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs in that (the affected limb): then leave it for some days until the abscess becomes warm; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 Stricture it thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 You must wrap over the fracture a hard dressing, that is, bandage; and fold it double, or thrice: and there remains an excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg, until you reach the heel at the root of the toes.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper side of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wind over the leg and the hip what remains excess from the linen cloth.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place a star on the hip at the site of the fracture and place one star on the ankle bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the cavities between leg and hip with soft cloths, so that it is evened out by the bandage.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle of the site of the fracture with three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you move away from the site of the fracture with the bandage, let your bandage be less tight and softer, and more gentle.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then direct the ends of the thread, which you inserted between hip and leg, to the two extremities.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie three stars with each end (of the bandage).
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts until you reach the shoe.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And with each end also tie the ends of the stars on the other side: so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then let the bandage remain on that (fracture), so that it does not happen to the limb that it rots, or abscesses, or swells and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If anything happens from this.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Approach therefore with its removal, and correct all that happened from there completely, according to what we said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If it is a fragment from bone that punctures bone: then it is necessary, if possible for you, to make it even.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 If not, fill over it and remove it; and care for the memory of who preceded it until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this hip fracture is tightened, besides which studs are added to it, as we said in the help and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in its restoration, a limp does not usually occur in such a fracture for the weak.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he who has it will limp always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip tightens in 50 days or is too little added, or too little reduced; all of this is according to the diversity of temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Chapter on the restoration of the knee joint fracture.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the knee joint rarely breaks, but it often occurs in grinding.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If a break does occur, then not otherwise than by a crack or hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 It is with an injury, and without an injury.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands up on it completely with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And its restoration is thus: to make it even from the parts that are broken with fingers until it comes together and joins as much as possible according to the equality, ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then apply a plaster made from flour of sesame or mill, with egg white; and place on top a round stud, if necessary for it; and bind over it with strapping fitting to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as hot abscess and similar ones; thus opposing every occurrence with what suits it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 On the restoration of a broken leg.
Caput XVII.	 Title VII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is large and called the Leg, and the other is small and called the Shinbone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens that each of the types of fracture is as it is with two bones of the arm; and because of this, the restoration is done equally, and the operation is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If two bones are broken at once, the leg bends in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the small bone is broken, the leg bends towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If the large bone is broken, you find it lower; and they are among those which do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, equalization, and ligature of the stars equally according to that.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the break in the leg is a dirty one with many seepages, it is necessary that the extension be less, and your massage be gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the leg there is something above the arm operation; and it is that when you equalize the stars, and finish your entire operation, then take two bands made of pine wood, which are used for the construction of solar panels placed under tables; they are made from spatulas of the palm; choose those with a small thickness, and neither from the smallest nor the thickest; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then roll over one band with two rolls according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 Place one part of the leg on one side and another part on the other; they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind the two bands in three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 Since tightening is forbidden, the leg bends to the right and left, and it stands with a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And indeed, it is administered the cradle made of wood according to the length of the leg, and let it be placed upon it for the purpose of preserving it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And indeed, it is necessary to do this in a fracture when there is a wound precisely.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day and strive with utmost diligence to prevent it from swelling, inflammation, or other afflictions.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If something from among these occurs, then apply the appropriate remedy to it until it heals, if God wills it so.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the fracture of bones in feet and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 The calcaneus bone does not break entirely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 The bones of the feet sometimes break, and it happens less frequently to the fingers; they do not break except after a great impact in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If the bones of the feet break and you see that the bones are raised above each other, then place the affected foot on a prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then you stand and place your foot on the raised part from those bones; then press or tread on it; and hold it even, until it returns to its original position.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place a plaster and wool on top of it; and place under the foot a small table with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with an appropriate bandage when you have unwrapped it with linen and other necessary items.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones evened out if they are broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore, treatment is done as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are broken, then restore them and even them out as I told you in the treatment of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place your finger at the length of the digit, and make it slightly wider; then place under the foot this board that I told you about, and bind it with a suitable suture.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is fractured is two bones, or three, or more, then place a splint of its size over every digit, rolled in linen cloth; and bind the board below the foot; and let it stand on one side of the board outside the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is fitting for you to remember that you should consider all things that I told you about the other types of fractures that we mentioned; and apply each of them in accordance with what is required.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 Chapter on the fracture of a woman's cheekbone, and the breastbone, and the thighbone of a man.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's cheekbone is fractured, then make her sit upright.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then lean her towards the back of the same slightly, and hold her fast behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then let the midwife fill the woman's cheek with gauze until it is full; and make a swelling on the cheek from this as if it were a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then the woman is shaken, and the back of her is scraped gently.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For this gauze comes out until it becomes before the woman's cheek as a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a poultice on the back of her.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Whenever you want to mix, remove the gauze easily, then mix; and bring it back according to the way in which you introduced it first; then return to the poultice first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let this be done for seven days or about, because the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of an egg, and bind it over its hole with a reed tube, and introduce the whole bladder into the woman's cheek.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated within the wound, for the fracture will heal.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it shall be filled with fat and allowed to remain for some days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the bone of the breastplate breaks in a man or woman, administer to its restoration and give it the same medication as we have described for the bone of Ancha.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And in such close fractures that are not common, particularly those with some study or use, do not cover the rectum.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 Understand my book well, for the fracture itself shows you in many dispositions a way to restore the rectum and constrict it: understand this then.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 In the penis of a man when it breaks, take a goose's throat and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place upon it a covering of cloth and wrap it, and let it be for three days or about that, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 Chapter on the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is suitable for the one who has a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if it is large like that of the hip or arm and similar to it, to hurry and have the patient bled immediately: if the conditions of bloodletting are attested to you as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound exudes blood, then it is necessary to hurry to its amputation, so that you crush dry ashes over it: if there is nothing else present with you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then delay the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess settles down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 Do not approach him on the third day, and especially not on the fourth; for you will cause bad things to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone is projecting above the skin and visible: then it is necessary that you pull it back into place with ease and slight extension of your hands.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If the extension is not prepared, and its alignment with your hands: then reduce it using this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingers' width, and its width corresponds to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four [pieces], according to the amount required from each of them for that cure in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness to prevent doubling upon itself during the hour of the operation; and let it have sharp edges, with a margin at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let the upper part of it be thicker in the middle until the lower end.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 In this operation, the sharp, curved end of the instrument should be placed on the edge of the projecting bone; and push it back with one stroke until the bone returns to its place and aligns in some way.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Try to bring the ends of the fracture together.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the ends of the fracture are subtle and do not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut the edge of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you are unable to reduce them with the method I described, then cut it with the knife as appropriate for that bone, or saw it with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape that which remains in the bone due to roughness and small cortices.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and, after its reduction, a severe pain that weakens occurs, then you will know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do that [scraping].
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you confer great help to the weak one, when you complete the restoration which you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse a cloth in starch water, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place over the wound lint of linen, nor anything that contains oil; so as not to cause decay and corruption at the same place.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer stars [medicine] in the hour of completion of the bone's restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And let the wound heal: so that you cut with forceps a hole in the inflammations according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 Take care not to tighten the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For this many times have foolish physicians done it: and they have caused death, or decay, or purulent discharge, that is, pus, upon the weak ones.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your ligature be soft, gentle, and a variety of ligatures for fractures remaining.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large and you fear some evil accidents that we have mentioned and find pain at a suspended place: then it is not necessary to put stars [medicine] over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make for them inflammations from hard cloths in the place of stars, and tighten it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 And when it has been one day or two days, and you see that the wound begins to produce pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer linseed, and ointments according to our custom, to heal wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is fitting for you, that you release the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And examine the wound every day at morning and evening, until it heals and recovers.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the limb should be prepared in such a way as to allow the purulence to run out from it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass and the wound does not heal nor purulence is discharged from it: then know that there are small fractures of bones in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound with pressure.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 How many of these fractures are separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated and pierce the limb, causing pain, try to cut them and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If a gangrene or an ulcer occurs on the wound, that is, if it becomes corrupted or putrefied: then it is necessary to apply to each of them what is suitable for it according to its treatment, whose account was given in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from what follows my speech should be clear, and when a bone breaks and protrudes on the limb, such as the hip or shoulder, or similar large bones, do not attempt to draw it, for many times death results from this, indeed let it be, until it becomes corrupted.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Therefore, take care of the wound if it seems necessary to you; otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of nodules in a broken fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Head Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This knotting often occurs in the process of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially those near joints are prone to becoming foul-smelling from this deformity.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from undergoing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, if the knotting is recent, administer to it remedies that have astringent properties, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, gum tragacanth, acacia and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Mix some or all of these substances together, and make a paste with astringent solutions such as wine of alum, egg white, vinegar; place the paste over the knot and apply a tight binding around it using a good thread.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the bandage undisturbed for several days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then remove the bandage and apply a new one until the knotting disappears.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind over it a well-centered piece of lead.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 Lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the knotting has already turned into a stone and is tight and pressing urgently for removal, then apply a poultice on top of it from above, and cut away any projecting excess; or grate it with certain scrapers until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 [Paragraph about the treatment when the limb remains subtle after the injury, not according to its nature.]
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture heals and the limb remains subtle and weak, it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is an abundance of dissolution of ligaments and bandaging of it that is not as required; or due to excessive binding of ligaments, which prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to an excess of embrocation at the wrong time; or due to a lack of blood in the body of the sick person and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 The treatment for that is to feed the sick one, and to make his body tender, until blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	 Administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 Introduce joy and happiness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the limb, so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 Then apply ointment to it with warm water until the nutrition returns and it regains its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 [Section on treating fractured bones when they are misaligned.]
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When the limb that has been restored after its healing becomes twisted or protrudes due to a broken bone or nodulation, and it is disfigured because of this change in the shape of the limb; nevertheless, the limb is not prevented from undergoing its natural operation: then it is not necessary to listen to the opinion of him who thinks that the limb should be fractured again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who did that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is greatly to be condemned, leading to death or great fear, so that it might well be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 However, if the limpness and nodulation are recent: then it is necessary to apply with warm water, in which have been boiled softening herbs such as elder leaves and its root, sweet clover, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And make a plaster for it with a softening plaster such as well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or take the mucilage from elder roots, and pound it with chicken fat or sesame oil; then plaster it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or they may take figs rich in oil, and pound them with pigeon dung and similar ones that are called from medicines for reducing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the nodulation is resolved with frequent, old-fashioned, and gentle rubbing which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And let movement of the limb be applied to every part in each hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If, however, the twisting has already occurred beforehand and has become strong and turned into stone and a necessity for treatment with iron has arisen: then it is necessary to cut above it, and to relieve the continuation of the bone, and to make an incision on what surplus there is from nodulation or bone with fine incisors; and let ease be applied to that with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 On the discussion in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the displacement of any joints from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it should be prevented from moving and deformed in shape of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes the occurrence of pain over the weak and violent injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When there is a dislocation, then it is necessary to hurry for its restoration; it should not be delayed at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the place will become cold and possibly with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it should not be moved or stretched during the hour of setting it.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because it frequently causes spasms and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when this happens, then it is necessary to hurry for the bloodletting of the weak.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be left until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then immerse the limb in warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then reduce it gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And treat all the limbs with it, when its memory comes back to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even according to what preceded in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the care of dislocations of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two lower jaws seldom dislocate except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or they are moved slightly away from their places and softened slightly.Ľ or they are moved to a considerable distance from their places and become hardened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they dislocate completely, with the dislocation, until they soften to the chest, until the saliva of the weak runs out and it cannot hold it or close its mouth, and the tongue is rolled up with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When however the dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself with scarcity in many positions.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If however it is a complete and whole dislocation, then it should be administered a reduction quickly and not delayed deeply; and it is so that the servant holds the head of the patient, and the doctor inserts his thumb into the root of the mandible dislocation, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or insert two thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, as he holds them thus.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the patient to clean his jaws and purify them for eating in every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The doctor holds the jaw, and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated at once: then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, until it becomes easy to reduce both; do not delay the reduction of both as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and align, and the patient's jaw is closed and not softened: then place on them pillows of cloth, with a beeswax mixture made from wax; and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it should be tied easily with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the patient sleep on his back; and let his head be upright between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left; nor should he attempt or be forced to chew something; rather, place his food in a soft form, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is straightened: then he may eat what he wants, and let it be given to him easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He should not labor on his mouth's operation during eating and drinking, nor speaking, until the jaw is straightened and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they dislocate at some hour and do not return to their places: then often fevers occur, and perhaps continuous vomiting of bile follows. Perhaps the weakened bowels dissolve, and perhaps pure cholema comes out.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 When you see that, know that it is a loss, and the one to whom it happens often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The collarbone does not dislocate from within the side due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside, which can be felt.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration is to lie down weak on his back and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then, press the dislocated joint with the palm of your hand in a strong grip, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place plaster and small stones on it, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 The joints that follow the elbow, which are continuous with it, do not dislocate except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it dislocates on some day: then it must be reduced and made equal according to what we have said, and what you should prepare for yourself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place plaster and small stones on it, and bind it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And instruct the sick person to adhere to calmness and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment, the end of the humerus is reduced when it also separates from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One is when it dislocates towards the part of the axilla towards the lower parts.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second step is to dislocate it towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And possibly it is dislocated towards the upper arm: and this is done rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 It should not be dislocated towards the back, because of the handle.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 It should not be dislocated towards the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Indeed, it is usually dislocated and exits towards the lower side, turned upside down; especially in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly in them.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it behaves contrary to this, namely because it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps some people experience a blow or accident, and the arm is dislocated with heat, and it is thought that this happens because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, one must try this out until you are certain about it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 A dislocation is known when it turns upside down towards the lower side; and you will distinguish between a dislocated arm and a sound one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find a manifest difference among them, and in the head of the arm you will find an indentation, and under the swollen part of the arm near the felt head of the humerus as if it were an egg; and an invalid cannot bring his hand to his ear or move it with all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if the arm is dislocated towards the chest or upwards; then you will find a clear feeling, and it cannot be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 A reduction of this type of dislocation is easy when it is recent or the patient is a weak child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction of this involves lifting the hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under the swollen part and lift the joint with force to its place; and the hand is lifted up and stretched out towards the upper side.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then put it below (it returns quickly by itself).
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If it does not return as mentioned, and the dislocation has been there from the beginning, then it is necessary that the sick person be bathed in warm water, and a poultice be administered which softens and soothes, such as if they decoct the roots of althea, and fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and it should be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick person is laid on his back on a table: and a sphere made of flannel or wool should be placed under his back which is equal in firmness between softening and compressing.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor places his heel on the sphere, and raises the head of the arm with strength, and pulls the hand of the sick person towards the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another servant holds the head of the sick person so that it does not move downwards; for it quickly returns by itself.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish (to hold the arm), do so in this manner: and there is one who should be present who is taller than the sick person, and he stands at his side, and introduces his own arm under the sick person's back; and raises the sick person's back upward until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant pulls the hand of the sick person towards the lower part of his stomach.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick person is light: then it is necessary to weigh him down with something else, for the dislocation immediately returns by itself.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 It can also be reduced in another way: and there is a way of making a wooden stick on the ground, whose head is round in shape like a mortar handle; it should not be heavy nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then the sick person is placed on top of a wooden log, soft pieces of cloth being placed under his head; and the sick person should be standing along the length of the log.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand should be stretched downwards from the other side, and his body should be extended from the other side with force: for the union returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If his reduction is difficult through all that has been said, then use this care: and it is to take a piece of wood whose length is the size of two forearms, and its width four fingers, and its thickness two fingers: which should have a rounded head, so that its entrance may be enlarged deeply by rubbing.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then wrap soft cloth around the rounded head to avoid damaging the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then place it under the weak person's hand or arm, so that his hand or arm is extended over the wood to the lower part: and tie the wood to the helper and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then let his arm be placed on a step of the ladder at its width, and his hand should be stretched downwards, and the rest of his body should hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the union enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When his entrance is completed as much as possible: then it is necessary to place a sphere of equal size under the rubbing made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place a prepared plaster made from milled powder with olibanum and egg white over the whole shoulder, as it is customary to do so.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tie a bandage fittingly under the rubbing: and wrap the rope over the plaster above: and connect his hand to his neck, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary to provide a small amount of food until the limb recovers strength: since it heals more quickly.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let him be bathed larger than before, or after seven days, or five, and scraped with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it is firmly set and not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the suture is repeatedly dislocated due to moisture that occurs in it, or due to another cause: then it is necessary, that cautery be administered into it with three holes, according to what was stated in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done completely, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the suture does not harden, and the plaster and stricture are applied on it several times and it does not harden and falls off and cannot be elevated to above: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have been cut or stretched or softened: and you know that the suture never heals in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 Dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast or towards the backside reduction is done by pushing and extending with hands until it returns, and afterwards the rest of the stricture and care are administered to it until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If after healing there occurs pain in the limb and slowness of its movement, then the sick person should use baths frequently, until that pain is alleviated, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 You should know that the shoulder joint dislocates with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty as well; and it is dislocated to all parts, especially to the anterior or posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 Its dislocation is not hidden from you; since it falls under the sight, and under touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join a dislocated shoulder with a healthy one, its dislocation is made obvious to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint should be concave and cannot double the arm nor touch it with its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you hasten and immediately reduce the dislocation, before it develops into a hot abscess.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 If a hot abscess occurs, its reduction becomes difficult; and it may not heal at all, especially when it concerns the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For every kind of dislocation is worse, and it is accompanied by a more violent pain; and death often comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce it, is as follows: extend the hand with two hands; the arm should be expanded; the hands of the physician should be above and below the elbow, and he himself should push the disjointed part with the tips of his fingers or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front: then it is reduced as follows: he separates his hand with his own hand until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer violent and strong traction; and it is necessary that two attendants extend the arm, and they should hold him so that he is not moved during the traction.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is rotated to every extent when it is wrapped around his hand with a double cloth or broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the disjointed part with his hand, he binds it with oil; so that it is from those things which aid in lubricating the disjointure with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he pushes the disjointed part with a violent thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After the reduction, it is necessary to place on it a plaster that contains an antiseptic and astringent with white wax; and it should be bound with a tight bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And the arm of the patient is suspended from his neck, and it is left for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it is unfastened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If [the part] is fastened in its place, then loosen the suture from it and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the suture is not well tied, then repeat the plaster, the suture and let it be for several days until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then unfasten it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If there is pain to him after the reduction of the joint and it moves: then administer humectation in bath, fine friction, and compression until it settles down, or place on the joint of the loin, that is, the fat of the ram's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then it shall be tied and let it rest upon it for day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Take it away, and insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When it sweats, then rub the joined areas with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then repeat this process three times upon it, and at each introduction into the bath until it becomes softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place upon it horse dung, moist and heated with butter, and press it upon it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Make this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes softened, and returns to its former state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 [Paragraph of Albucasis' Treatise on the Treatment of Dislocations]
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Mahasem (the camel driver) frequently dislocates his hand, that is, the joining between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 Contrariwise, the reductions of other joints are...
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, speed should be present in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour in which it occurs, before the location is released; otherwise a hot abscess may occur at the location.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is such that Mahasem (the camel driver) places his weak hand on a table, and extends it; then the doctor should place his palm over the prominence of the joint, and push until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it should be considered if the palm has already receded to the back of the hand; then the weak hand should be placed on the table for both extension and reduction, and if the dislocation is moving towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inward on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls upon the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, that is good; if not, then press it with an ointment to settle the abscess, and let it rest, do not repeat this process.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 If it does not tolerate [the reduction], nor can you make it [back] through reduction after the days have passed, but a connection remains according to its twisting: and nothing harms the sick except that it is softened by the hand, and nothing can be tightened: then you will know that the nerves have been cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 It is not skilled in that [operation], except to tighten it with a cautery near its loss.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it contributes nothing.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Since Almahassem does not return, then place on him a plaster as I have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it should be tightened and let it be for five days; afterwards it should be loosened and let it be, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If it should be deprived of movement and something heavy should happen to it: then soften it with warm water and friction several times until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 [Title] On the Treatment of Dislocations of Fingers.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated in any direction from the fingers, or when it is dislocated to the back of the palm or the palm's inner side, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the head of the finger and suspend it turned towards the direction in which it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it, and extend it until it becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, tie it as I have said; and do not cease to loosen it during the day; exercise it with movement; and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until it becomes tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And likewise do with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; and tie it to that part itself, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And similarly do with him when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 On the treatment of spondylolisthesis in the back.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When someone suffers from a dislocation of the vertebral or cervical spine, or many vertebrae are displaced from their places: then there is no cure in it, since death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And a sign of this is that the sickness departs without will, nor can it be held; and many times some of his limbs are softened from him, or both legs of himself, or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For many times it is displaced, which often happens in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 That which is displaced towards the rear is called Kyphosis.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The cure for it is to consider whether Kyphosis occurs from childhood; then there is no cure in it, nor is healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs from an accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancient ones have said the methods of cure in a lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Of it, many do not return when going forward.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I myself have already shortened it from that, which very slightly differs from much of his due to my proximity and intention; and in the way I exposed it, and fashioned its instrument, I formed it differently from how they showed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that in Kyphosis which occurs from the front part, there is no healing nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in that which occurs on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from them, except that which occurs in the back properly, as I tell; and it is to be stretched out weakly on a flat surface close to a wall; and a wet blanket should be spread under him so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight piece of wood fixed in the bowl on the ground, at the end of the foot, about its head: and another piece of wood about its feet at the other end of the foot: and let a servant hold the wood, and it should not be fastened in the bowl.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And let another servant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then cover the head of the sick person and tie a soft bandage around his temples firmly: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is at his head, and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then tie another bandage over his shins, and above his knees, and near his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bandages together and tie them to the other wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then all the servants should extend their bandages towards the parts of the wood, and neither of the woods should be moved from its place where it is fixed: but they should not be fastened, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician should place his hands on the dislocation with firmness until it returns; or he can place a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he ties his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And hollow out a place on the wall that we mentioned near the sick person, into which the end of the board can enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the board on the dislocation.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And the physician should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tie it firmly until the dislocation is straightened and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, work with the wheel that is moved by your hand: and it is so that you mark on the ground at the head of the sick person at the end of the second foot two pieces of wood, whose length is an arm's breadth: and at the head of him at the end of the second foot two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length be that which is between every stick and a palm's breadth; and now a hole has been made in every place where the tourniquet runs; and let all the sticks be firmly fixed to the ground very much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And let a round stick be inserted; and there is a tourniquet where the ligament is turned within two holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the end of it there is a hole, where the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm plus what is turned over; and similarly on two other sticks.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tie the ligaments which you have tied on the chest of the sick one, at the band that is near his head; and tie the ligaments which you have tied on his legs in the band that is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 The attendant stands at every bandage-holder who twists his hand with the linen, with which the bandage is turned; and the doctor equalizes the Spondylos, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 Here is the form of the bandage that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then, after the Spondylos returns and the place is equalized, it is necessary that you place a plaster of dry pitch with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then cotton wool.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place a star-shaped piece of wood on top of the plaster whose width is that of three fingers or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length is as much as to cover the hump and on the healthy part of the Spondylos.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the ligament that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the sick person should use a subtle diet until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something remains as a prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the use of the tablet that we have said for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now lead is administered on that sheet of tin.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 Sometimes a prominence occurs in the last Spondylus on the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone which now protrudes is it.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore it is not necessary to make an assumption about this medicine for him; perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 § On the treatment of a dislocated Anchus.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 You should know that the connection of the Anchus and the connection of the shoulder do not occur except in dislocation; nor does what occurs to the other joints due to a slight separation and concavity happen to them.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And indeed, the joint of Ancha is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 It is because it is dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Indeed, it is mostly dislocated towards the inside; and only slightly dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment of this dislocation towards the inside is: because when you join the healthy leg with the diseased one, it is longer; and its knee is prominent more than a healthy one, and the diseased person cannot double his foot at the thigh; and there is a place that follows the thigh, which is pierced by a hot probe, for this reason, since the head of the hip has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign of this that occurs with a dislocation towards the outside is: because its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign of this dislocation towards the front is: because it expands the healthy leg at the shin; but it does not double without pain that is in the knee; and if he tries to walk on it, he cannot step forward; and urine retention occurs, and his thigh is pierced, and during walking, there is a stepping-on of his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of this dislocation towards the back is: it does not expand the knee, nor can it double it before doubling the thigh; and his leg is even shorter than the other; and his thigh is softened, and the head of the hip is at that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation, however, is to consider then if the dislocation is old, which has already healed with it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then, if you administer the reduction of this and it remains according to its own position; then there is no treatment at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it should not be presumed upon him entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the one whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocations; then hasten to this, that you wish to join the joint, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it right and left: perhaps it returns, and does not need other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary to prepare a strong attendant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with his hands or with a rope that can be tied above his knee; and another attendant should extend his arm from above, so that he may introduce his hands under the nails.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then tie a soft rope over the root of the hip and hold the end of another one.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let there be an extension from the front of the groin to the neck of the buttock, or from the back to the back part.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let the extension be equal for all of them until the weak one is lifted from the ground with his body and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 For this kind of extension is a common type of four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If the dislocation returns as we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to do everything that I will say about its treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the treatment of this kind when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary for the weak one to lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then tie a rope over the root of the hip where it is between the hip and under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the rope upward from the groin to the neck of the buttock.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong attendant takes his arms and reduces the large area of the weak hip and extends it with a powerful extension to the outside.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now it has returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this kind of treatment is easier than the others for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If it is resisting you and does not obey you at all with this kind of treatment, then it is necessary to tie together the feet of the weak ones with a strong rope, gently, on their heels and knees; and the length of each should be four fingers from its own root; and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by two digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then the sick person is suspended over the head of a beam, which should be in the house; and let the length of it from the ground be equal to two arms' lengths.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to brace the head and loins; another youth shall suspend him with the sick person; and another youth shall push him, bracing the loins with strength, for the joining returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In his own reduction, when it is a dislocation to the exteriors, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a bench, as we have said in the one with a humpback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And bind a bandage over his leg, tightly for the sick one, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two beams are placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a beam is placed in the middle of the bench, well fastened; over which cloths soaked in water should be rolled up, so as not to harm the sick one; and there should be a beam between his loins, so as not to pull him down towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let all assistants go to their respective positions, and the physician will equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If therefore it obeys in returning, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the table and press it equally, as we have said in the one with a humpback.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the sick one's leg be extended quickly; and this is the same story on the bench; and let the physician place his right hand palm over the groin of the sick one.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with the other hand, and with this bending place him extended towards the lower parts at the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if dislocation is towards the rear: then it is not appropriate for the sick one to be extended to the lower parts and lifted up on the earth: instead, it should be placed on a hard object, as it should also be done when dislocating its joint towards the outside, according to what we said about placing it on two hard objects: and it is on its face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it should be administered compression with a board also on the place from which the joint goes out, when reduction is completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend two legs of the sick one: and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg and expands it without dislocation: then you know, that the limb has returned, according to what is required: then join the thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with wet wool, that is, a roller: thus, so that the joint is not moved in any part: and let the sick person remain still for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then unbind the ligament and the plaster, and tie the leg with the other one: then if you see them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation has become stable: release therefore the sick person for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softening: then return, and apply the plaster, and bind it according to your first compression: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then unbind it and make it walk slowly on both sides for some days until it recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Chapter on Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated towards the outside, towards the inside, and towards the lower parts, that is, towards the rear.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated towards the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 The sign of its (dislocation) is that you command the sick man to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If it does not adhere with the hip: then know, that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all ways of its (dislocation) is that you make the sick man sit upright, so that now he can extend his leg if possible over it, and let his back touch his face; and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them across the fingers on the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply with your palm two sides of the knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another servant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of returning is that the leg adheres with the hip gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then plaster it (the wound) and make the leg adhere with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then dissolve (the bandages) afterwards.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the sick man should not walk for a few days until he is cured.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If the reduction refuses to you, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, whose preceding story is found in the cure of the hernia, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Chapter on the treatment of ankle dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 When the heel is sometimes removed by a small displacement and sometimes dislocated in full.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its (ankle) dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of the ankle's dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, advancing towards the direction to which it was dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The cure of its (ankle's) removal is simple reduction: and it is that it is extended with ease with hands, and aligned until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 In the cure of such [dislocation], when it is dislocated according to its complement, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and the strong attendant should hold him firmly from the rear part of his back, in the middle of himself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold [the bone] with your right hand from the upper part of his foot and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot, in place of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with your left hand, press [the bone] twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend [the limb] with your left and push the sole of the foot with your right without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do that twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg in the third time and you pull the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If therefore it returns once or twice in this manner and you see the foot aligned, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on him; because he will return [to its place].
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If however the reduction of it is prevented by him as we have said, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground and fix a wooden peg firmly in the ground so that he falls between his hips: and you now have wrapped a cloth over him, so that he does not harm the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let the attendant take hold of his hip: then another attendant should extend [the limb], either with his hands or with a bandage that binds around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then all attendants should extend themselves in opposition to each other and the peg shall be standing between the hips of the patient holding him, so that his body is not drawn downwards at the point of extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with his hands and another attendant holds the healthy leg towards the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 The dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation returns and its healing is revealed to you: then place plaster and wool, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And be careful or fearful of the nerves that are above the heel-bone at the back, so as not to bind too tightly over them and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let it be for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the bandage becomes soft, bind it again: then unbind it on the third or fourth day; and prevent a weak person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he attempts to walk before that time, there is no certainty except that the dislocation will be dislocated again and ruined, and will not receive healing afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If a hot abscess occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer to its sedation what was previously mentioned about the treatment in another place, and embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on Dislocation of Fingers of the Foot and Treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that what is dislocated be equalized with little extension without effort; and this indeed is not difficult, but easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 But if the dislocation is in certain knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the weak person makes his foot sit on an equal place on the ground or on a table; and he stands thus as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and place your foot on that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is now equalized, and the projection no longer appears in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put under the heel of his foot a table which catches his entire foot, having two legs.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then tie it up with a suitable suture for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then dissolve it, and let him rest from walking for many days, until it is tied up and secured against reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 On the types of dislocations accompanying wounds or fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something occurs from that [situation], and you try to cure and restore it, death often occurs multiple times; therefore, one should not presume upon such a cure, unless the one who is experienced in long practice, merciful, devout, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous. And let him use in beginning medicines that suppress hot inflammations only; and let him leave the sick to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for salvation from destruction with gentleness of illness, and where there appears something of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Try therefore to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If therefore the member returns as we wish, then administer a regime that suppresses an abscess; and heal the wound with it what suits it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If therefore there is a dislocation with fracture, and splinters separate in the bone, then try ablation of them; and do as I said in simple diseases in the places where they were.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering into the path of fear; according to what preceded my prediction to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for you before your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more safe for your body before them in your time.
