of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates towards the armpit below;
and the second is towards the chest/breast;
and sometimes it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder blade, and it does not dislocate inwards because of the sinews/nerves;
and it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because in these it jumps out easily;
in those who have enough flesh, it dislocates with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And sometimes it happens to some men a blow or a fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this. 
It is therefore necessary that you examine it, until you are certain;
and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is down towards the armpit, and compare the injured shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them;
and you will find a hollow at the top of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg;
and the patient cannot bring their hand to their nose, nor make any movements;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly by touch;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset when it is recent, or if the patient is a child.
And the method is that the practitioner lifts the patient's hand upwards, then places their fists under the armpit, and forcefully lifts the joint upwards into place;
and the practitioner lifts the hand and extends it upwards, then puts it underneath;
it will return quickly.
And if it does not return as we have said within a few days, then the patient should be bathed in hot water;
and the practitioner should administer softening and soothing ointments, such as a decoction of marshmallow, fenugreek and melilot in water, and it should be applied;
then the patient should lie on their back, and a pad of wool, even, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the practitioner should place their heel on the pad and carefully lift the head of the shoulder, and pull the patient's hand;
and another practitioner should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards;
that shoulder will return immediately, and you see, reset it in this manner:
and you should have a man present who is taller than the patient;
and he should stand upright beside him, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit up, so that the patient hangs in the air;
and another practitioner should pull the patient's hand downwards towards the belly.
And if the patient is too light, hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation will immediately return (to its proper place).
And it is also reduced in another way:
a long stick is driven into the ground, the top of which should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin;
then it should be placed under the patient, but with soft cloths on top, and the patient lies along the length of the stick;
then his hand is pulled downwards strongly on the other side, and the joint will quickly return to its place;
and if it will not return despite all these things that we have said, then do this treatment:
take a firebrand two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round end so it can be inserted deeply under the armpit, in this manner:
then tie soft cloths over the end of the stick, so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of sufficient width, and his hand should be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side:
the joint will return to its place immediately.
And when it is in place, in whatever manner, you must put an even layer of wool under the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over the whole shoulder and around, then tighten it suitably under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and bind the hand to his neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And he should eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after 5 or 7 days, and move it;
and if it is firm and not soft, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries with three holes, as described above in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot lift his arm up, then know that the nerves at the top of the shoulder are cut or stretched or weakened;
and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is near the chest, and the breasts, or behind, occurs from a push, and stretching of the hands, and there one applies another dressing;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if after healing, stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, then the patient should use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and returns to its former state.
