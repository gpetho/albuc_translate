Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the hernia that is in the groin.
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we have said, and the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the testicles. And if it does descend, it is a small amount and returns at all times.
But if it continues for a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum, and this happens from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we have said.
That is, the peritoneum stretches and then relaxes, and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is with cautery, as I have previously described.
It can also be treated with iron in this way: The patient lies on his back in your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely for a length of three fingers, then you pack the peritoneal layers that are under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum underneath it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then sew the two protruding parts on the edge of the probe from the peritoneum and attach one to the other with the stitching.
Then remove the tip of the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When the sutures have dissolved, clean it and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia protrusion does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this area because it is closer to a cure.
