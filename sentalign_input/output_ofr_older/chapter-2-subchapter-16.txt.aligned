Know that the eye nail (a growth on the eye) is of two types: one is nervous and resembles a hard surface, and another that is not nervous but resembles congealed white moisture, which when touched with iron or tried to be taken with pincers, cannot be grasped; and both types start near the large tear duct and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, all the light, and the movement of the eye.	Ungula occurs in two forms: either the nervous, which resembles a fine hard membrane; or the non-nervous, like a white congealed humidity; which, when the iron touches it or you try to pick it up with a hook, is cut through and the hook has no hold on it. Both kinds grow from the greater angle of the eye, whence they spread little by little until they cover the pupil and block both the vision and the movements of the eye.	0.7798461
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the fleshy tissue and tear it, and that the pupil is not pierced; and after the incision, throw a little ground salt into the eye, and eyewash made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.	But beware lest the scalpel touch the corneal covering and cause a fissure in it and the pupil protrude. Then after the incision put into the eye a little powdered salt or an eye-lotion of verdigris, and leave it till the following day; then treat as may be necessary till it heals.	0.8003973
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot place the needle, and the hook cannot enter, many times this type of nail is treated with medicines; and they grow as I have described in the division, and if you want to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take the light, slightly sharp spatula, in this form:	If the ungula is non-nervous in origin and you cannot transfix it with a needle nor get a hook to hold fast in it, this sort is often successfully treated by medical means. So treat as described in the section.	0.6791427
And lift the nail delicately, and if you see that it diminishes to a point and the root approaches, then distill from your mouth into the eye eyewash made of litharge and red eyewash and ground salt, and cover the eye until the next day; then restart the procedure with this same work, until it is all removed.	So treat as described in the section. But if you prefer to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a fine smooth scalpel, rather blunt, like this and with this gently scrape away the ungula from above; and if you see that it is crumbling away and breaking down under the scraping, then immediately instil into the eye some eye-lotion of verdigris, or the red eye-lotion, or a little powdered salt, and bind the eye up till next day.	0.74091876
If anything is not contrary in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then restart the procedure as before, until it is healed.	Then repeat the operation on it till you have removed it all, unless an abscess forms in the eye, in which case cease the operation and treat the abscess till cured. Then repeat the treatment with the same scraping till healed.	0.71566415
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct greatly harms the eye, then suspend it with the hook, and cut a part of it but not all, so that the flow of tears does not come; then distill into the eye red eyewash made of litharge.	As for a protuberance of flesh in the angle, if it causes great hurt pick it up with a hook and cut part of it away, with not too big an incision lest there be a flux of tears. Then into the canthus instil red eye-lotion or lotion of verdigris till healed.	0.731421
