The dislocation of the hand	On the treatment of a dislocation of the wrist.	0.44409692
The joints of the hand dislocate, and their reduction is easier, more than other joints. However, it must be reduced quickly, at the same time it is dislocated, before the area swells or a hot abscess forms.	The carpus of the hand is often dislocated. Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.	0.8400806
And the reduction is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the practitioner aligns it, placing his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.	The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.	0.83844495
However, it is necessary to check if it is well placed; then have the patient place the back of his hand on the table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, let the patient place the back of his hand on the table, and the practitioner places his hand on the prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, that is good.	But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself.	0.81422853
If not, bind it with plasters soothing hot abscesses, and leave it without reapplying.	If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be.	0.6694678
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, the joint remains twisted.	Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed.	0.55539846
And it does not harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut, or the arteries; and there is no other remedy except cauterization near the area, and possibly nothing else will help.	But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised. In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all.	0.77393436
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then untie it and leave it like that.	When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.	0.8066384
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, bathe it in warm water, and rub it until it is healed.	If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.	0.70690906
