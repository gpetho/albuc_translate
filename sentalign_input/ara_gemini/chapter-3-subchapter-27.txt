Chapter twenty-seven on the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty, and it dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is located under the sight and under the touch, in whatever form it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this will be clear to you with a clear explanation by the concavity of the joint, and he cannot bend his arm nor touch his shoulder with it.
And it is necessary to hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot swelling occurs to it, because if a hot swelling occurs to it, it will be difficult to reduce it, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backward, because it is the worst of all types of dislocation and the most severe in pain, and death often occurs with it.
And its treatment, if it is possible to return it, is that an assistant extends his hand with both his hands and his arm outstretched, and the physician's hands are from above the elbow and from below it, and he pushes the joint with both his thumbs or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be returned by bending the hand suddenly until it strikes with the base of its palm the shoulder that it faces.
If the dislocation does not respond to returning, then use very strong and powerful extension, which is that two assistants extend the arm and two assistants hold the patient so that he does not move during the extension, then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage on his hand.
And when the physician handles the joint with his hands, he wipes it with oil so that it helps in sliding the joint easily, then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns.
And after its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage on it that contains astringent and drying properties with egg white, and tighten it firmly, and suspend the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for days, then loosen it. If the joint is stable in its place, then loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see that the joint has not become firm yet, then repeat the bandage and the binding and leave it also for days until it becomes firm, then loosen it.
If stiffness occurs to it after the return of the joint and its loosening and difficulty in movement, then let him use moisturizing in the bath and gentle massage and rubbing until it softens, or place the tail of a fat ram on the joint, then tie it and leave it on him for a day and a night, then remove it and let him enter the bath.
And when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then repeat the tail on him once, twice, and thrice with entering the bath until it softens.
And if you want to put on it fresh, soft cow dung with ghee and tighten it on him, do that several times, because it will soften and return to its original state.
