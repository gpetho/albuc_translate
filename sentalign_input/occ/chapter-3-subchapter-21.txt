Chapter 21:
On the restoration of a fracture when it is healed and the limb remains thin and fragile, not in its natural state.
When a bone fracture is restored, and afterwards the limb remains thin and fragile, this is due to several causes: one of which is the large number of bandages and their incorrect application; or excessive tightness of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive embrocation; or excessive movement not at the right time; or lack of blood in the patientâ€™s body and their weakness.
The cure for this is to feed the patient and make their heart tender until their blood increases; and administer baths; and bring joy and happiness to them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water, until the nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural state.
