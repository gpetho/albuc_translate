Of the forceps/tweezers
The clavicle often breaks anteriorly, towards the shoulder, and the fracture occurs in three ways: either it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore; or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder blade near the broken clavicle; and the other stretches the neck towards the side; then align the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither a bump nor a depression.
And if you need to stretch more, place a round bolster of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and let it be thick according to your need; and stretch and lift the clavicle, and press the bolster with your hand, so that you align the fracture as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards, because it goes inwards deeply, then the patient should lie frequently on his back, and put a medium-sized pillow under his shoulder, and let the assistant push the shoulder downwards, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then straighten the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it shattered, then you must make an incision over it; and pull out the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join because of any protrusion, then cut it with one of the incisors that you have; but make sure you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the periosteum.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and is as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the nature of the work; and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, like the opening of the wound that you made when you extracted the bones; and when you are certain of a hot abscess, then sew the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses develop there, soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without incision, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and put light compresses on top, and put a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very large bandage, a palm wide, then put a double cloth over the compresses and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around this bandage, so that the ends of the bandage are hanging; and place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and bring it back from each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you see clearly that the splint does not move over the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the bandage loosens, tighten it; and have the patient lie on his back, and when he sleeps put a small pillow under his armpit to raise the shoulder; this will alleviate the clavicle fracture by elevating the shoulder, or you can tie his arm to his neck, and do not untie it unless some bad accident occurs, for up to twenty days; then reapply the plaster, if you see that it is needed, and tighten it and leave it like that, until it is healed; and it is healed in twenty-eight days at most, and in fewer for some people.
