Chapter 52:
On the treatment of umbilical eminence.
Umbilical eminence is caused by many factors; either by fissures of the diaphragm that is above the belly, and from it, the membrane or intestine comes out as in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by confined wind in it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the diaphragm and the coming out of the membrane, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body; and it is smooth without pain, and it appears in various locations.
And if it is due to the intestine coming out, then the location of it is more varied as we have described, and when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden, and then it returns; and it becomes very prominent after bathing and vigorous work.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is smooth and is not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor increased.
And if it is due to blood, then with these signs, the abscess appears with a dark hue.
But if it is due to growing flesh, then it is a serious abscess, large and hard, and fixed to a certain extent.
But if it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth.
And the operation on it is that you consider if the umbilical eminence is due to blood from an artery, or vein, or due to wind; then you should avoid treating it, as there is fear and dread in it, as I have explained in the chapter where I talked about abscesses from arteries and veins.
And if the umbilical eminence is due to the intestine or membrane, then instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie extended; then mark around the entire umbilicus with a probe, and instruct him to stand bent between your hands on his back, and then encircle the umbilicus with a wide spatula on the location you have marked with the probe; then extend half of the abscess to the upper parts with a large hook; and then tie around it with strong thread or silk in the proper manner of tying.
Then open the middle of the extended abscess over the binding and insert your finger into it and seek the intestine; and if you find and guard it by the binding, then carefully extract it and push the intestine back into the inner parts of the belly.
And if you find the membrane, then take it with a hook; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is contrary to you, an artery or vein, then circle around it, and return to your operation; and take two needles and insert strong threads in them and insert the two needles around the circuit you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, and make them penetrate; then tighten the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you want, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh decays and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thin and decayed, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the umbilical eminence is due to growing flesh or moisture, then you should hollow out the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or moisture you find in it, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments to solidify the place.
