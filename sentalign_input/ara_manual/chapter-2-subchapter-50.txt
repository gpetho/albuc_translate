Chapter Fifty.
On the swelling that appears from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, swelling also occurs in the nerve if it receives a blow or results from excessive fatigue or the like and this is most common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a protruding swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body, and in most cases without pain, and if pressed hard, the patient feels a kind of numbness, and the swelling is not deep in the body.
Rather it is under the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it does not go forward or backward. So whatever of it is in the joints, it should not be exposed to iron, for it may cause chronicity, and whatever of it is in the head or in the forehead...
Incise the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. And if it is large, suspend it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it. Close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
