Chapter thirty-four on the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
It is appropriate that you straighten what has become dislocated from it with a gentle extension, without violence, and this is not difficult, but easy.
If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the back of the foot, then it is appropriate that the patient place his foot on a level place on the ground or on a board while he is standing like someone walking.
Then stand yourself and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints, then tread on it with your foot with force until it returns and you see that it has straightened, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the whole foot, which has two ends, then tighten it with a tight and firm binding for three days, then loosen it and protect him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are assured of no recurrence, God willing.
