And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, it is necessary that the patient sits cross-legged, and sits straight before him evenly;	When a fracture or crushing of the palm of the hand occurs the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of the right height in front of him, on which he should put his outstretched hand.	0.7508216
then he places his hand on your outstretched thigh, and the practitioner extends the broken bones, and sets them evenly, until they are well joined;	Then an assistant is to extend the broken bones while the doctor straightens them so as to achieve a proper union.	0.61731696
and applies the plaster and the padding, if no abscess develops, then applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.

And if the fracture is on the inside around the hollow of the palm, make a ball of cloths, and instruct the patient to squeeze it against his fractured palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather, as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as needed.	If the fracture be lower down, near the inner part of the palm of the hand, make a ball of cloth, bid the patient grip on it with the fractured palm of his hand, and then bind it up with a long bandage. The splint should be of leather that is somewhat soft, so as to fit into all the folds of the palm; and bandage it on suitably.	0.86928236
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must put a splint on top and another underneath in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then tie it all around the hand, and tighten the bond between the fingers.

and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, align it, and tie it with the healthy finger next to it; or you tie them all together in one grip, which is better, or you put on a splint, as with the thumb;	If the break be in any of the other fingers, such as the middle or index or little finger or the ring finger, straighten it out and bind it to the sound finger next to it; or let them all be bound up one to another, which is better; or apply a small straight splint, as we said for the thumb.	0.8612253
