On the treatment of Varicocele, which occurs with a swelling.
Chapter 64.
The swelling is an abscess enveloped in a certain layer, resembling a cluster of grapes, along with the softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this condition, there is a need for caution due to what has been previously mentioned.
But it is necessary that we describe the operation as the ancients performed it.
I say, therefore, that you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then, push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downward.
Then, hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels near the penis; and another assistant should hold and stretch them with a strong extension.
Then cut with a broad, sharp blade, making a transverse incision in line with the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Then strip away from every part, as we described to you in the extraction of the arteries in the temples.
Afterwards, insert a needle with a doubled thread into them, and tie it at the first place where the swellings occur, and tie it again at the end of these locations.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision along the body's length and extract the accumulated foul and corrupted fluids.
Then treat the wound with the same treatment as for other wounds where you wish to produce suppuration so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles are severed.
For it is not harmful because of this.
But if the swelling affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles along with the vessels, so that the testicle is not deprived of nourishment, which would cause it to waste away, or dry up, and there would be no benefit in keeping them.
