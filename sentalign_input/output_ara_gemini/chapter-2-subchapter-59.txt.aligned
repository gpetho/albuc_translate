How to inject the bladder with a syringe and images of the instruments suitable for that	On the manner of irrigating the bladder with a syringe, and the forms of the instruments that serve for that.	0.71039736
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, it has a long thin tube, and if you want to instill water and medicine into it, this will be by a tool called a syringe	When there occurs an ulcer in the bladder, or there is a clot of blood or a deposit of pus in it, and you wish to instil into it lotions and medicaments, this is done with the help of an instrument called a syringe.	0.6013283
It is made of silver or ivory, hollowed out, with a long, thin, hollow tube, except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	It is made of silver or ivory, hollow, with a long fine tube, fine as a probe; entirely hollow except for the end, which is solid with three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	0.9025277
And the hollow place in which the piston is, should be of a size that it fills it without any extra space, so that if you pull something of the fluids with it, it is drawn, and if you push with it, it is pushed to a distance, similar to how the pump is made, which is used to throw naphtha in sea battles.	The hollow part containing the plunger is exactly of a size to be closed by it, so that any liquid is drawn up with it when you pull it up; and when you press it down it is driven in a jet, as is done by the projector whereby naphtha is thrown in naval battles.	0.77736807
So if you want to introduce fluids into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull the piston upwards, then the fluid is drawn into the cavity of the syringe.	So when you wish to inject fluid into the bladder, dip the end of the syringe into the fluid and draw up the piston, for the fluid will be drawn up into the cavity of the syringe.	0.9098909
Then you insert its tip into the urethra, according to what we described for catheters, then you push the fluid with the piston, and that fluid reaches the bladder at the spot until the patient feels it.	Then introduce the end into the urethra as we described for catheterization; then expel the fluid by means of the piston; the fluid will immediately flow into the bladder and the patient will have a sense of its entry.	0.86752987
And this is a picture of a nice syringe also, with which you inject the bladder:	This is the illustration of a fine clyster also for irrigation of the bladder.	0.59751236
It is made of silver or "espadroia", its upper head resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove in which the bandage is placed.	It is made of silver or white copper. The upper part of it is like a small funnel and beneath it is a groove where falls the thread of the ligature.	0.6345071
Then you take a camel bladder and put in it the moisture that you want to inject into the bladder, then tie it between the two partitions tightly with a doubled thread and warm that moisture a little on the fire.	Then take a camel's bladder and fill it with whatever fluid you wish to wash the bladder out with, and tie it to the syringe with a strong ligature of double thread between the two ridges. Warm the fluid a little over the fire; then introduce the end of the siphon into the end of the urinary meatus.	0.7966788
Then you insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, then tighten your hand on the bladder with the moisture tightly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.	Then apply strong pressure to the bladder containing the fluid until the patient can feel the fluid has entered his own bladder.	0.7629845
If you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of thin leather, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around, then insert a strong thread into that hole as you turn.	But if you have not a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and cut out a circle; then make holes in the edge all round the circle; then pass a strong ligature through these holes all round and draw the circle in, as a bag is closed with a draw-string, first putting into it whatever fluid, oil, or water, you desire.	0.7038004
Then gather the circle as you gather the tablecloth after putting in it what you want of moistures, oils, and water, then tie it in the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.	Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as with the camel's bladder, squeezing until the fluid reaches the bladder of the patient.	0.534195
