On the treatment when restoration leaves the limb thin and not in its natural state.
Chapter 22.
When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this happens only for several reasons.
One reason is the frequent loosening and improper binding of the ligament, or due to the excessive tightness of the bindings, which prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to excessive embrocation at the wrong time, or due to a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
The treatment is to feed the patient and to soften their body until blood increases in it.
And administer baths.
Introduce joy and cheerfulness to the patient.
Then place pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it.
And continually apply embrocation with warm water until nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural shape.
