 CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR.
On cauterization for tremor.
 When someone has a tremor, either from chill in a nerve or quartan fever, or from some other cause, you should cauterize him four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra, and one on his breast and one on his stomach, with an olivary cautery.
Thus the tremor will be stilled and the dispersal of the cold distemper will be hastened.
