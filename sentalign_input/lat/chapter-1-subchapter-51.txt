On the method of cauterizing an abscess or boil.
Chapter 53.
When someone has an abscess (Adubelati) that is slow to mature, either due to excess humor causing it, the patient's advanced age and low blood volume, or the season, and you wish to hasten its maturation, then apply multiple small cauterizations around its circumference by making tiny pricks.
Then leave it as it is.
This will cause it to mature more quickly.
If you wish to lance it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, shaped as described.
Apply it in the center of the abscess until it pierces the skin, and it should be done in a way that allows the pus to drain, relieving the patient.
Then treat the area until it heals.
