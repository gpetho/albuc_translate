of returning the marrow to its place
Here follows the shape of the press, with which one squeezes books;
and with two turns at the two ends of the two cords.
However, the horn should be more slender than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood should be one finger wide, and the edge of the boards one finger, and the length a palm and a half;
and in the middle of the two planks should be two additions of this same wood, which should be attached to each, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are placed at the mouth of the hammer to open it when one turns the two cords.
Another form, resembling it but more slender and lighter, is made of ebony or boxwood, like tongs;
and it has at the two ends two additions, as you see, of a palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the hammer with the whole instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, feet hanging and legs open, then put the two additions joined together into the hammer, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs;
then open your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs evenly, according to how much you want to open the mouth of the hammer, until the midwife does what she wants.
These instruments are all surmounted, and their forms are multiplied;
and when the physician has prepared them, the work is more rapid, and better for men because of their quantity.
So do not despise the instrument so that you don't have it prepared, because their necessity is not excusable.
