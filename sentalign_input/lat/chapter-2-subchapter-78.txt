On the extraction of the afterbirth.
Chapter 78.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then you should instruct the patient to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with a condiment, and press your hand over her mouth and nose.
If it comes out as a result, it is good.
If not, then take a pot and perforate a hole in the cover, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, like calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sseha, cinnamon, and centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the cover of the pot, and place the other end in the mouth of the womb; let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
For the afterbirth will come out with ease.
If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage.
Then she should insert her hand into the vulva and search for the afterbirth with it.
When she finds it, then she should take hold of it and gently stretch it out little by little.
But if it is attached deep within the womb, she should insert her hand, as we have described, until she finds the afterbirth, and pull it out gradually in a straight line, so the womb does not fall due to forceful traction; rather, it should be moved gently to the right and left sides, then more traction may be applied as needed.
Then it yields, is freed, and escapes from its adherence.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described, treat her with sneezing and the medication from the pot with herbs.
If it does not come out with everything we have described, then be careful not to exhaust her with repeated extractions.
Instead, it is proper to tie what comes out at the mouth of the womb to the woman's hip.
Then administer a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For this will cause it to decay over days, dissolve, and come out.
However, when it decays, a foul odor will rise from it to her stomach and head, harming the patient.
Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered for this.
Some of the ancients have tried fumigations with watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for retention of the afterbirth and menstruation.
It should be made of glass similar to alcama, or from bronze; place the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation is placed on the embers; she should hold it until the fumigation is consumed, and repeat another.
