Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the frenulum that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
This frenulum that occurs under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.
The procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth with his head in your lap and lift his tongue, then cut that sinewy frenulum transversely so that the tongue is released from its constraint. If there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and incise it transversely until the frenulum is severed and the knots are loosened.
And beware that the incision not be deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding occur. Then after the cutting he should rinse his mouth with rose water or with vinegar and cold water. Then place a wick of linen under the tongue, which the patient should hold every night.
This is so that it does not reattach. If bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the area. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the area with a lenticular cautery suitable for that.
Then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he recovers.
