Chapter 50 on the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and a vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the nerves when they are struck or due to excessive work, and for similar reasons.
And it occurs mostly in the places of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are affected.
And it is a severe abscess, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and it is mostly in the large joints, and when it is pressed with force, the patient feels a kind of numbness in it.
And it is not an abscess aggregated in the body's depth, and therefore it is under the skin, and it is affected all over and does not move forward or backward.
So those that are in the joints should not be invaded with iron, because it will very easily lead to contraction.
But the one that is on the head or the forehead, separate the skin with a spatula.
But if it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors and cut it off from the roots.
And if it is large, then you lift it with a hook, scrape it, and then remove it; and join the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
