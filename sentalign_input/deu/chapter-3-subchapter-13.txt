Chapter 13:
On the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures of the wrist and knuckles of the fingers are rare, and they usually experience wear and tear.
When a fracture or wear happens to the hand, the patient should sit squarely and place their hand extended in front of them.
An assistant should extend the broken bones, and the doctor should align them properly.
Then, apply a plaster and cotton if there is no severe abscess, and place a splint according to the injury's location, wrapping it in a cloth.
If the fracture is on the inner side of the palm, create a cloth ball and instruct the patient to grasp it with the injured palm, securing it with a long cloth.
The splint should be padded with cloth to be gentle on the palm, and tighten it as necessary.
If the fracture is on the outer side, place a splint on top and another on the palm side to keep the hand open and straight, and secure it with a bandage wrapped between the fingers.
If a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles, especially the thumb, align and secure it properly with the palm, and if desired, place a small splint to elevate the fracture and prevent movement.
For fractures in other fingers, like the middle, index, little, or ring finger, align and bind them to the adjacent healthy finger, or bind all together, which is better, or place a small splint as described for the thumb.
In the restoration process, consider the possibility of severe abscess and address it appropriately, following the methods previously described.
