# Prompting Claude

Claude 3.5 Sonnet was run between Nov 1 and Nov 4, 2024 using the free tier in the web chat interface.

The initial prompt was the following:

```
The following text is from a medieval Latin translation
of the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis.
Translate each sentence line by line. Do not stop before having
generated the translation for all sentences. Retain line breaks:
```

Only single-turn chats were used to use the token usage limit efficiently. Between 3000 and 4000 characters of Latin text were copied and pasted into the chat, usually one or several complete chapters.
