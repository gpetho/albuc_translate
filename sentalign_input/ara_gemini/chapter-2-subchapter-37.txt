Chapter thirty-seven on the excision of the uvula tumor which is called grape.
If a catarrh descends to the uvula and swells and is white and oblong, then it is called 'amood'.
And if it is thick at the bottom and round, then it is called 'inabah'.
If it is treated with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot swelling has subsided and it is thin, then it should be cut.
And what is of it gathered and round and does not have length and is bloody or the color of pus or black or has no sensation, then it should be avoided cutting it, for there is danger in it for the patient.
Then it is necessary, if you see it in the manner that I mentioned of its whiteness and length, that you seat the patient by the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument which was previously described.
Then you insert the hook into the 'inabah' and pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.
And it is necessary that you do not cut from it except that which exceeds the natural order without addition, because if you cut more from it you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals.
If the patient is afraid of its cutting, then it is necessary that you use a trick in cauterizing it without fear or caution.
And the way of cauterizing it is only with the strong medicine, which is that you place the head of the patient in your lap, then you compress his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Then you take from the strong water which I mentioned in the chapter of cauterization and mix with it unquenched lime and make it neither thick nor thin and fill from it the cavity of this instrument and this is its image:
Its end, in which you place the medication, has a concavity like the concavity of a cautery spoon.
And you place the instrument with the medication on the uvula itself, with the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then you hold the medication with your hand and you squeeze it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medication has subsided.
And if you wish, you can take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a cautery iron, and soak the cotton in the medication, and insert the cautery iron with the cotton in a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula; you do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula, then you leave it, for it will wither and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to reapply the medication, you reapply it.
And after the cauterization, you wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee and dry the medication around it with it.
Then he gargles with cold water and is treated externally with poultices and internally with gargles until he recovers.
So, this type of treatment is safer than excision and further from fear.
And the uvula can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and excision: it is treated with fumigation in this manner.
Take lavender, hyssop, savory, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and artemisia, and similar herbs, and gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar and boil them, and the pot is lined with lute of wisdom, and there is a hole in the middle of the lid on which the hollow instrument is mounted; it is made in this way from silver or copper:
And you insert the end that contains the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well fumigated.
Then you repeat it several times until it withers.
And beware of doing this treatment at the first appearance of the swelling, because it often increases the swelling.
But it is appropriate to do this when its hot swelling subsides.
If this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end so that the patient's mouth does not burn, because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this is among the best treatments, along with its safety.
