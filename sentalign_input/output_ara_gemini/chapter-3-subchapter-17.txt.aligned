Chapter seventeen on the fracture of the bones of the leg and fingers.	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.	0.8897147
As for the heel, it does not suffer a fracture at all.	The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are.	0.425942
As for the bones of the leg, they may suffer a fracture, and the toes also rarely suffer a fracture, but rather they suffer a bruise in most cases.	The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.	0.7045841
If the bones of the leg suffer a fracture and you see that those bones have overlapped, let the patient place his foot on the ground upright like a walker, then you stand and place your foot on the raised part of those bones, then step on it and straighten it until it returns to its place.	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking. Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place.	0.89260954
Then carry the bandage and the splint from above and place under the sole of the foot a small board that has two flat ends.	Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads.	0.8613814
Then tighten the foot tightly after wrapping it with rags and all that you need.	After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.	0.65580016
When three or four days have passed for him, release the bandage, for you will find the bones straightened, whether they were broken or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see.	When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.	0.8673506
But if some of the toes are broken, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand. Then make for the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it.	If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it.	0.83556974
Then place under the foot this board that I described to you and tighten it tightly.	Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly.	0.91731584
If the broken bones are two or three or more, then put on each toe a splint of its size inserted in a soft cloth and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.	If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.	0.8855949
And you should not forget to observe all that we have mentioned to you in the rest of the fracture, of the symptoms that we have mentioned, and treat each symptom with what is appropriate.	And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.	0.7752465
