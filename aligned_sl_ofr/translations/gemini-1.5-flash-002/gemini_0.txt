O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its expositions and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is neglected in our region and is completely and entirely suppressed, the science is lost and fragmented, and nothing remains of it except the brief descriptions in the books of the ancients which the hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are obscured and the science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will add the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is neglected. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number, and the course of the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates said that name without deed is much, and with deed is little; and likewise in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that he who is not knowledgeable of the things mentioned above, let him beware lest he fall into error and kill men;
as I have seen many times, many of those who meddle in this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish surgeon who cut an abscess of scrofula in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead into his hands.
And I saw another surgeon who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew that if he was cut he would die.
And I saw another surgeon who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the surgeon, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture over the wound with strong ligatures, and left no drainage for the wound, and left him in that state;
and ordered him not to untie it;
and it remained so that the leg and foot were completely swollen and came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and untie the leg; and when I had untied it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But still, the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another man who had an inflamed festering abscess, and then it became inflamed by the malice of his lord.
For a canker, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it is not necessary to touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove everything that is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, it is necessary that you know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in several ways;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard yourselves, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your instruments carefully, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that through God's grace you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to serious treatment;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness unless you are called a foolish doctor.
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is on fire cauteries and on cauteries of sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is on cutting and piercing, and on cupping and wounds, and on the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is on restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest and subtlest science and the secrets concealed;
and of this many wise men spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery helps universally to every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some have debated and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the contrary: that cautery is not good for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be cured by heat, nor by dryness;
and he who said the contrary said that cautery greatly helps a hot and dry illness that occurs in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes by experiment.
And in any case, let no one meddle with it except he who has proven it, and who knows through long usage the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and comes only to the member which is cooked, and harms no other member except very little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and bring to the member illnesses of difficult healing; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its heat and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is superfluity.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and for this reason I excuse myself for the length of the speech, for it does not please me that I should hide from you the secret which is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it drives out the illnesses of the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the resulting harm is overcome by the help of the cautery; and similarly if the cautery is for necessary, strong and urgent pains that cannot wait for a time when a greater illness might come to the limb.
And never think of it, dear son, as foolish people do; for an illness that is cured by cautery does not return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than medicine for the speed of its effect, and for the virtue of its work and its dominance.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes returns according to the patient's complexion and the location of the illness and its strength;
and superfluities are gathered in him by the consumption of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for an illness and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this falsely, but because of the quality of gold and the high value of its substance;
and they said that the cautery site does not become putrid, but this is not true, for I have tested it and found that it is true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it is immediately cooled;
and if it is heated too much; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness that is called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and likewise for all illnesses that come from coldness such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by a purgative medicine purifying the head three or four nights, according to what the strength and age and habit of the patient can endure; and then shave the head of the patient.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his knees;
afterwards place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers will go, bleed him from there, then heat the cautery which is called "olivare", of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move it downwards and inwards with your hand little by little in a turning motion; then lift your hand quickly, and examine the area to see if you see the bone a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and apply it to the area, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is healed; afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses; and therefore it helps to move.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one cuts away what is burned from the bone, and it is healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and press so hard that one burns away bone as wide as the whorl that women put in their spindles, so that the humors may more easily escape;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterwards one should treat and heal it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in certain cases where there is danger;
and it seems to me I should leave it there;
for the head is weakened by the continuous secretions of nature, as we witness in other members;
and similarly when the patient's head is weak by nature, the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and therefore I use this method for the overall good.
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills which are called "cochie," and head purges, and oils, and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have said before, and it is ineffective. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize a little below that cautery which we have mentioned above. Then make a cautery on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place which is called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping glasses are applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not go all the way to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the horns be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the head cautery When a sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by purifying medicines, and the other treatments that I have described in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not help: then I make cauterizations according to two methods, that is to say with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the rind and cut it a little at the two ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, tie it and bind it well and leave it so for twelve hours; and then untie it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound so for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the suppuration comes out.
Afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is in this manner. Heat the cautery which is shaped like this:
And it is called "clos" because the head is made in the shape of a bell or it has a little curvature, and in the middle has a small opening;
and put it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and an abundance of blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and put it on the area for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter there, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellare," use the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned, of medicine and of iron, are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery that is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus on the painful area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and ensure that you do not cut the artery and that you do not go down to the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and let the nerve be such that it moves and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, especially to one who is not knowledgeable and experienced. and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been used, and the pain does not subside, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which this is the form:
Afterwards, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move slightly upwards from the root of the ear after you have marked the place of the burn; and let there be ten points around each ear;
afterwards, treat the place until it is healed.
Of the torture of the mouth
A torture which ought to be cured by cautery is nothing but that which moves from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not make any cautery for similar things which come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you cure this similar kind of torture which moves from phlegm with bloodlettings and purgations of the head and with gargles, and this does not work, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the part which appears healthy, and make the cautery towards the head of the ear a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the curette which we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
afterwards treat the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that purify the brain;
after shaving the patient's head completely, and applying to the occiput the mustard plaster which is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of cautery: if he makes it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space of one thumb's breadth between each cautery;
and cure it like the others, and if you wish to add, and the patient can tolerate it, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and cure it until it is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and what we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; after the cure until it is healed, and let the cautery be what is called "olivare" that we have said before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary to first cleanse the brain of humors and with other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is large and suffering to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, give him gargles and mastications cleansing the brain often with good foods;
after shaving the head in the middle, and apply one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and suffering, apply cauteries as I have said for one who has paralysis and bodily weakness, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, apply one small cautery in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, there are corrupt superfluities or humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink to purify the brain, according to what has been described earlier in the section.
Afterwards, shave the patient's head; then make a well-made linen compress, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient should sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then present the liniment, and it is worth using old sheep butter; and warm it over a fire moderately, so that the fingers, when one puts them in, can bear it; then empty the circle inside onto the head, and let it cool;
and do this for the patient once each week, along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, making several punctures throughout the cautery.
This method of cautery moistens the brain equally;
and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and guards it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times on an empty stomach.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the whole cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself against the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood issue forth, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision of the cautery how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery is made or a heating instrument under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have spoken of at the beginning of the descending water to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and II cauteries on the II temples, and II cauteries on the nape of the neck under the two bones; and if there is more need, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with one small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and he does not improve, then give the patient to drink three boiled eggs; after raising the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inwards, and prick the eye, and cauterization is done in two ways: that is to say, by fire, or by burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, then the patient puts [them] in your hand; afterwards draw on the paper with the eyes a figure that is like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs;
then put cotton moistened in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
Afterwards cauterize on the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burnt in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the paper retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter until the burn is gone; afterwards cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after that the hairs come, and the skin is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are missing, cauterize until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one-third, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form you have made like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the skin; and if the disease affects only one eye, one should operate on one, and if on both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be on your lap, and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it lightly and move it every time the patient feels the medicine bite, for it bites like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the skin, and see if you see the membrane raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, put more medicine on the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burning sensation has subsided, afterwards treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard your work carefully so that no medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the skin becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, then restart the medicine on that area which is softened by the skin properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, and according to that should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be denied to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake his head;
then put moistened cotton in egg white or parsley juice on the eye;
afterwards heat the cautery which is as follows:
and is shaped at the head like the form of a vulture's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
but however, this one which is shaped is more valuable for your work.
Afterwards, press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the putrid matter, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the pus;
afterwards, apply the hot cautery, and hold your hand to the cautery at the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not move foolishly; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery again, and another time if you need it, and leave it for three days;
afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass without it being healed, apply a corrosive watery medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is a type of cautery for fistulas that some of the ancients mentioned. Attend to the fistula, and cut the place; afterwards put into the incision a thin cauterizing iron of which this is the shape: and it is made to the quantity of a third of a lead weight; and hold your hand with the cauterizing iron firmly, and let not the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, it is good. If not, then it is necessary to make a hole in the nose, and to bring the fistula to the body of the nose according to what is appropriate in its proper place.
of cracks in the lips Very often cracks occur in the lips which are called "chapped lips", and similarly in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the sections, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards, treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess appears in the root of the throat, or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it forms pus and breaks and is old and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the sections, and it does not improve: then you must have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the last place;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and that is not effective, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery, whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
then lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your judgment;
afterwards let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this way, the tooth that was loose is fixed, and the softened gums are restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is coldness or greenness [a discoloration], and medical treatments are ineffective, then cautery is necessary in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take butter of a cow, and put the end of it in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent [probe], and moisten it in the boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it cools;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and apply it to the aching tooth, and apply a hot iron until the fire reaches the tip of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze cane, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient;
then heat the cautery, whose shape will come next, and apply it to the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the application of that cautery, and then rinse it strongly;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever head you wish, and according to what you have power;
and this is the form of the chain:
of the scrofula When the scrofula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the form follows, and it has two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold constitution, then the patient must first be purged with laxative medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and not to burn near the heart but a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the juncture of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery be that which is called "clavile" of which we have the form before;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When all the illnesses of the lung are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is chronic, apply two cauteries on the clavicle in empty places; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavicle" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the entire cautery which is called "points", of which the form is described above, in the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After, treat the place according to what is said before, and let the cautery have three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is inside the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery which has two nerves of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for that reason a cautery is made with the cautery which has three nerves, because of which the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, because of which there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, apply the cautery with crushed poppy seeds and salt; afterwards make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated upwards, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When in the stomach there are chills and much moisture to the point that it alters its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied in it, and in the accustomed methods of treatment, and it does not improve, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make for him three cauteries: one under the hollow of the breast, of the size of a finger, with the entire cautery iron; and two cauteries outside the two sides so that the shape of the cauteries is triangular, and there is such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point according to the amount you wish to draw out; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the cure that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is far removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then the patient must be bled on his vein; and make three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the ribs of the man come;
and let there be a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be long in the direction of the body, and do not press your hand very hard on the whole cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient be standing on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your wish, cauterize these cauteries with the cautery iron, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach boiling, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment weakens the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then bleed from the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which this is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the flesh is burned, and reach down to the fascia, until the perforation is completely through;
after the treatment according to the treatment of wounds until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that anyone use this cautery except he who has studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and by whose hands these diseases have been treated sometime.
Then he can boldly operate, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
Of the cautery of pleurisy
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a root of long aristolochia, the largest that you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and grind it in oil, and apply it to the fire, and cauterize; one cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower in the part that is below the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, leaning slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some people use a fire cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops which cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse, as we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cautery which are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line according to the length of the mouse, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have described before;
and do not press your hand on the entire cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two points, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is in the place of the mouse, or the side of the patient comes towards the left, and let the elevations by which you lift the heart be along the heart, along the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two burning points in until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery with three points.
After the cure, when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned before.
Cautery is not good for a dropsical person, except in the manner that is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back along the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge corruption for a long time, and do not neglect the care of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the small nail that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is set forth above.
When the feet are swollen in one who is dropsical, and are full of citrine water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the citrine water be burned, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the point of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without dressing, so that the water may flow out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestine are weakened, and cannot be cured by other methods of treatment; and you see the patient strong and of good constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been said before about the cautery of the stomach, a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the navel along with one small cautery on the groin, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient weak, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each thigh, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the rectum, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and have been treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those which are entirely outside below the armpits little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel two fingers breadth;
And if you think that his stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the entire cautery clavile; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then place it, burning hot, on that cut althelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards cure it with beneficial ointments until it is healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness arises that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupt moisture, you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and ensure that you know exactly how deep the tent goes.
Then heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to the amount that the tent has entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need.
and beware of burning the nerves which are there, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply the fire except to fleshy places, and consider that it is not piercing;
afterwards treat the place until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the place is entirely healed;
and if the matter is not removed, know that the place is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt; and thus like one of those which we shall mention in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and great flatulence, and he does not desire women, then you must cauterize him above the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery we have mentioned before;
and if we cauterize him in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize him in the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the groin begin, and one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the breadth of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the back, or two if you need them;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the form previously described.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers (menstruation) are corrupted and their times delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back;
and let the cautery be made with a hot iron, as we have said.
When viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when they are measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient over the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of olive size, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the hearts;
and cure it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the socket of the hip, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and wide, and have between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, wherefore there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the marrow of the bone is burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach down to the thigh or to the leg.
And if it reaches down to the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, on the left side a little;
and let the cautery be spoon-shaped, and let the thickness of the bone be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes of the foot or near them, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four points with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more for him;
and if he knows that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with the spoon-shaped or circular cautery, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery there so long that you burn the nerves and the large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have had cautery applied to the ankle of the foot, and they left it there so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot as well, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery in one and in the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said, in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let it be at the head as thick as a walnut, or a little less, and let it be perforated, and let it be from one perforation to the other a space the quantity of a thumb's knot;
and let the perforations be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then place it on the hip joint which is diseased, and let it be turned toward the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with the cautery round and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless this is one of the good cauteries, for one who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with notches in which the edge of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long wall, and in height it should have two fingers' breadth, and between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they are open outside and above, and they join together according to this form:
Then place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very much on the box of the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles hot water which has been heated over the fire a little, and let it remain for an hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For there is found a burning as of fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the warm water, and leave it so for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it three days so that pus may be drawn out;
and that would be the last aid after the treatment with ointments until he is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for him an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of the warm water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it; and put on top of that pot another pot well sealed, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is about two fingers above the powders when you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is administered in many medical operations and in cauteries of other limbs.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as testicle and honey and anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of the hip pain and sciatic vein, and he praises it highly, and says that no other cure was done, and that he was healed at once when this cure had been done, and he bathed himself as he teaches hereafter.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with one handful of grease, and put it on the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is somewhat warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all go away and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow which is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Afterwards take dried goat dung, and heat it until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in this way, and do not cease doing so until you think by feeling that it reaches down to the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from falling or from percussion or from too great evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these instances is cautery useful, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of foul pills or similar things, that three lines marked with ink be made on his back, where the pain holds, and in each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and the quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be made according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three cauteries or four with the medium-sized nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery touches each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply the cautery to a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints.
When joint pain is from humors that are spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra," and when it is from a cold cause and cures from medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you cauterize on the surface of the foot, make for it a cautery with the whole cautery which one calls "point". And if the pains reach to the knees and to the other joints, and this happens many times, make for it cauteries on each knee, three cauteries or four on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand there except until the thickness of the skin is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer to it the cautery that we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist two lines;
and if some pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains reach the elbows or the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend into the testicles and it is recent, then when you wish to cure it, he must not eat that day; and that he use things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly;
Afterwards, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are replaced, and push them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and with a mark that is similar to half a circle above the body;
Then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and throws off sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return back;
and open the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you reach the bone; and guard subtly that the bowel does not protrude when you do the cautery; lest you burn it; and that thereby the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cautery of children be small according to their size, and of adults also large according to their size;
after three days, treat the cauterized area with butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards, treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well healed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that the bowels do not move when he is urged to go to the privy.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, apply a well-made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days;
and let him have good rest, that he works little and guards himself from too great repletion of drink and food, and from too loud laughter;
and when he has followed this instruction he is completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing anymore, make a cautery with a cautery iron according to its size, and let a third of the heart be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery iron according to this form:
but first mark the place of the incision and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery iron.
But the first cautery is lighter and milder.
of old pain in some limb When pain comes in a limb, from a fall or a wound, and that pain lasts a long time, and the treatment of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points", and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twisting and its pain.
if he is healed by the first cautery, that is good;
if not, begin another cautery on top of that one, for it is customary that it must move to the limb that is closest, therefore it is necessary that you make cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great benefit, and similarly the illnesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you doubt that the corruption may take over the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the occiput;
and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize on the chin according to what is before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it is manifestly evident, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery in the middle of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and one other beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the buttocks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
After, cure the place with barley flour mixed with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When an inflammation comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be a little bit penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the end of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the inflammation is removed;
and however, no one should interfere unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the courses of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease that is called "albaras" is longstanding, and the medical remedies are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deep, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and kept on the place until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And nevertheless, the wise men say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen several times;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery which is called "circular", as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has a disease that is called "adubelati," and it is slow to mature, either because of the excess it produces or because of the patient's age when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the season; and you wish to hasten its maturation: then cauterize it around with many small, piercing cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you wish to pierce it with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it externally in such a way that the course of the putrefaction is alleviated.
Afterwards, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it eats away the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can endure cautery with fire, then heat the cautery irons, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places soft bread with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Afterwards, cure it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good;
and if not, then begin the cautery again on what remains of the corrupted places.
And this disease has sometimes been cured by liquid medicine in place of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the cure with liquid medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come to the feet Very often it happens that a disease arises on the feet from the outside, which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, swollen thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauterization of this disease is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron as if it were a pen, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can surround the nail from all sides, and that it has subtle edges;
afterwards place it, very hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to exude pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows pounded with oil, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are turned inward, away from the body, and this often happens in the hands and feet, then you must apply a hot water cautery; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a goose feather, and place it on the nail and the wart, that is to say, the small warts; and place the chain so that it encompasses the whole thing, then add a little hot water, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a way deep to the root;
and let the patient suffer the burning of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be completely eradicated with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the foot, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the health from the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
then it is necessary at first when they appear that one make a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held in the fire, or of the root of long birthwort, or with the lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Often there is great flow of blood from the artery which is cut in the wound which comes from a burn, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to staunch.
And however when this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this, one after the other, until the blood is stopped;
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have said: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by tight binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stop blood; and let it be tied and bound tightly.
Whoever attempts to stop it by tightly binding with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will achieve little benefit.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a remedy or medicine present, he should place his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it often with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and then do what is necessary with cautery and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all illnesses in which it is necessary to use fire cautery, or burning medicine, and the occasions, and the causes, and the instruments, and the forms of cautery;
and I placed that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will proceed in this chapter in the same way so that one may find more easily what one wishes.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first concerning cautery, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there is often evacuation of blood in opening a vein, and in the incision of an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision of a stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die from it.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many kinds of people come for treatment. some come who are so angered by their illness that they die easily because of the rage they feel from their illness and its severity; and one must fear these.
And among these are some who give you their senses, and say: Wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but put greater trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely on that which you are certain of, and from which you can gain praise and honor;
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients to which salvation should be converted;
and that will help you to acquire good renown, and glory, and memory of praise.
Dearest son, may Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may he inspire you with the holy inspiration of his hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in divisions by chapters, according to that which is before, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have described to you from head to foot, so that you may more easily find that which you may need.
Know that this illness comes very often to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those whom I have seen, death hastened; and for that reason it seems to me that I should leave the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day so much that he could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone above the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you cut into the head a wide incision;
and let it be as long as two fingers, until the moisture runs out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more grown, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is below the bone, and the signs that you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not returned to you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw out all the moisture. Afterwards, dress the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil there, and leave it so until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bandaged evenly, and give the patient dry meat with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you look where the size of the abscess and the collection of water are apparent;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and open it according to your ability;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease that is called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the disease is old, and the treatment of medicine does not help, then the last treatment is cautery with which one will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary, therefore, when you see them to be cut, that the patient throw back his head; afterwards rub the place with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient constricts his neck with the whole cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the places of one and the other are behind the ears, and are somewhat hidden;
then mark the places with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula in two parts, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can endure, and the fullness of the artery;
Then examine the wound: if any point of the dura mater remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and old, raging headache and similar things, and it is treated by various methods of medical treatment and all this does not help, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the manner of their extraction is that the patient should shave the hair from his temples, and look for the artery which appears in the temple, for it appears clearly by its beating, and is rather easily found except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is difficult to find, let the patient constrict his neck with some cloths, then rub the area with a rough cloth, and bathe the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is small, then turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it from that part according to the size of the two fingers. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow out completely.
And draw out six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that corruption does not enter before the closing of the wound, and excessive bleeding occurs;
then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the fingers are cut;
and this is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up the humors: therefore it is of greater help for humors.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made tents;
and when they are untied, let it be cured with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize it, or you fill the place with vitriol and constrain it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the place with cold water until the blood stops, and let it be extracted as is necessary;
And there should be a finger's breadth of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two ends, for it is not entirely sealed by this cautery in its entirety;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is milder and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the sharp edges should be very thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the top of the head, and no medicinal cure helps, and you see the patient's face redden, and he feels throbbing in the forehead like a tremor; and his face is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and burned by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contused cure," and it is that you should shave the hairs from the forehead of the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused cure," and it is that you should shave the hairs from the forehead of the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers wide in the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three joined fingers across;
and have prepared a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then apply the sharp spatula from two sides, which has this shape:
from the incision that is near the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the skin that is between the two incisions down to the surface that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument that is called "cultellaire", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side it is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side towards the raw flesh of the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears of the skin, and then do likewise in the middle incision to the other outside;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the area for the blood taken;
then place in each incision a tent of old cotton, and place over it cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that hot abscesses do not come there;
and on the third day untie the bandage, and apply a great abundance of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
When someone experiences acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and the vision weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that this matter and that catarrh comes from many veins, and the best treatment there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another of about an inch. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision reach the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two lips of the incision and put old cotton and linen tents there; then bind over it cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
Of the stopping up of the ears
Whatever falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or something similar such as iron; or seed, such as lentils, beans, peas; or a flowing substance such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun.
If you see the stone, instill a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then proceed with extraction; and make him sneeze with sneezing powder, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upward.
Often, the stone is expelled by this treatment;
and if it does not come out, proceed with extraction using fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it jumps out with the forceps, that is good;
if not, administer extraction with a fine probe of small diameter;
and if it does not come out by this, make a bronze chain and insert the head of the chain into the opening of the ear firmly, and stuff that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for many times it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, take birdlime, and place on it some instrument which is sharp for doing this, and place a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, hasten to cut open the ear before a hot abscess and spasm come;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear in the fatty tissue or depending location; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine forceps and a suction cup, as we have said, so that the extraction is easy.
In the water then that falls into the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing powder first, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take several stones according to the length of your middle finger, smooth and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet from the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out, and in this way it all jumps out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and grasp the other end with fire until the most of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, then administer extraction with tweezers; and that is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, extract them with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, take the candle of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the thinnest end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole candle; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey and come out, stuff around the candle with cotton as I have said in the case of a stone;
and if they still do not come out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made bronze instrument for this purpose, and if you wish, take a rasp and carefully wrap cotton around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines, into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then insert the rasp with the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be slightly warmed by the fire before it is distilled into the ear; and ensure that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to adults through blockage from a wound, or from flesh growing inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly obstructed, and one can see it well.
That which occurs deep within, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to cure in many cases, and in that which one can see, you must put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which this is the shape:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and back, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of raw flesh or body of the ear, then hold it with fine pincers, and cut it lightly, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is deep in the ear, then take a thin, light rasp and heat it a little in the fire, then put it into the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
then put into the ear a tent according to the width of the hole, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or you take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and sprinkle on powdered vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and apply another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, dip a sponge and cloth in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop the flow of blood which are in the treatment of distillations.
This little ulcer that comes on the eyelids when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin lenticular cautery, and the cauterization after the incision is worth much;
and often they return, when anything remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Often, in the eyelids, things appear which resemble hail in form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "hail," and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe if the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision, then lightly scrape each part, then take it with forceps, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does no harm to the patient;
and if the cut is large, join it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments will quickly restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and grasp the hailstone with forceps, and cut and press it from one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does no harm;
and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease that is generated in the webs of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and it greatly harms their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they always lie on their faces, and sleep thus, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, which swelling and appearance have covered with the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach of each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of appropriate width, and it should not be larger than the wound one makes in bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several ways exinach comes from the slit, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it all in one piece with a piece of lint between your fingers, pulling outwards, and turn your hand to right and left until it is separated;
and be careful not to go further into the slit with the spatula all the way to the eye, lest you injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt that moisture which has remained.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes to the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the eyelids When extra hairs grow on the eyelids, in addition to the natural ones, and they are neglected, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases such as habitual tears and softening of the eyelids and albugo, to the point of causing the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by a sharp medicine according to what is said before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cautery, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand;
if it is inverted, that is good; if not, then put a needle with thread on it; and let it be near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back;
then cut in the part under the eyelid, under the joined hairs, with the sharp spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one;
then pull out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the eyelid a figure of an arch, like a myrtle leaf, and always it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you wish to raise the eyelid which is divided for all.
And if there is someone who needs it, one cuts a large quantity of the eyelid according to how the eyelid is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then put the onion in one of the two angles of the corner, then peel it completely;
then join the two lips with a suture of a needle with a fine woolen thread, and wipe away the blood, and trim the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, do not worry about it, then leave the suture and threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without sutures with drying and constricting substances, for the paper rises at the closing of the wound and the joining of it, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you cut the paper in a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, into three sections separated according to the form which is here:
then cut what is above in small equal forces according to the form which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the tongs, and the thing is not equal, then take a needle with one thread, and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread near the large tear, and the second thread near the small one, and gather the threads equally between your fingers;
then lift your hand equally, and lift all the skin on which you have cut, as we have described, then bring together the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the wound are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the suture in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of fistulas is according to this form: and it is that you invert the wound and the slit inside according to what I have said, and then make two fistulas by art, and two thin threads as long as the wound and the width of the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully join one and the other above what protrudes from the wound of the eye, and strongly tighten the two fistulas of the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that is tightened will die and wither and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is healed, and the membrane is lifted, and the hairs no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two fistulas that you will make according to this figure, and according to this length and width:
The procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and knot the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with the entire chase into the root of the hair to be removed, and pierce it into the paper quickly until you pull it out from above the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the entire chase onto the paper along with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the chase from below with all the thread that you have arranged there, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then you will pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair is healed in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, then accompany it with a long hair from the natural hair, and it should be raised with that one or you leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this disease which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes in the eye, there are two kinds:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens suddenly from a wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that suture, and separate its lips, and put inside linen tents, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do that, the illness returns worse than before;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rose water or mallow and linseed boiled, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent, and cure it with that.
And the treasure of your cure is that you take care that it does not heal according to the form that it was before;
and these works that we have said are nothing but remedies for this illness, so that it does not return according to the form that it was before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accident comes from a wound and a fissure and a cautery and similar things;
and the method of working on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and stick it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it to a width of one spatule. And if the shape of the paper returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the paper, and make two fissures on the sides inside the paper;
and let the ends of the two fissures be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "I griesche";
then remove that flesh, according to the quantity that its sides are sharp below, of that which follows the paper, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then cure it with what we have said of softening medicines, and of tents, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a fissure or a suture or a cautery, then you must make a plain fissure under the hairs of the papers, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares a device with all his power how he makes the figure return to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is necessary for work and instruments in various situations.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the papule above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must insert the point of a razor under the papule, and lift it up;
and extend it with tweezers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which is neither too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer that the too sharp spatula wounds the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scrape this adhesion, be light, so that the papule returns to its natural form;
and this adhesion is healed, and sometimes they use salt water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water, and with whey;
then place between the papule and the eye a linen tent, and place on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and after the third day use whey and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to a hard membrane, and another which is not at all nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and thinks to pierce it with pincers, one cannot;
and both appearances begin towards the large tear duct, and grow little by little until it covers all the sight and all the light and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with small double-pronged forceps, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and insert it into the nail, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil and the silk on the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the thin spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh at the tear duct, so that the body of the tears does not come through the incision as usual;
and sometimes the nail is stretched with only the hook and the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with the smooth spatula of which this is the form:
And take care that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put in the eye a little crushed onion, and of the collyrium made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the incision cannot enter, many times this kind of nail is cured by medicines;
and grow as I have recounted in the section, and if you see it needs cutting, open the patient's eye, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula according to this shape: And scrape the nail subtly, and if you see that it diminishes little by little and the erosion presses on it, then distil from your mouth into the eye a collyrium made of litharge and of red collyrium and crushed onion, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is hindering you in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then recommence the other work according to this same method, until it is all removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye by great annoyance, then suspend it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that the tear duct is not damaged;
then distil into the eye red collyrium which is made of litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and covers the pupil and encroaches upon the eyelids and turns them outward, and resembles a pomegranate rose;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you grasp all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly;
then cut the top layer of flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be with the spatula that we have described in the incision of the nail and for small growths from which one removes the sebaceous matter, as the figure after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply crushed goose grease or distil red vitriol and similar corrosive medicines there, and put cotton over the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and do so as often as flesh is added to the eye in this way.
But however, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, with iron instruments;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the limb can tolerate that operation.
There are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they impede its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then, first, that you look if the eye, in which the sebel is, is strong, and there is no other disease except the sebel; then treat the eye in this manner:
instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, then suspend those veins with the unguent according to your skill, and let the unguent be subtly doubled according to this form:
And let there be two unguents by degrees in one body according to this form:
then one treats forcefully those veins subtly, and wipes the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and take care that you do not injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very fervent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, then distill into the eye green and red gall to corrupt that which remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to remove all of it at that time, then make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for some days until the pain is eased and the hot abscess is assured, then begin again in this manner which is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the treatment:
The Arabs call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with burning medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then there is a way to incise the abscess, where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it all away with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and it should be made of iron with one round head, and sharpened like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew itself and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to return the fistula to the hole of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron have three angles, and let the shaft be thinned to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind will come out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; this is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open, and there is no obstruction or narrowing of the nose, then you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses to the temple without wounding to draw out moisture, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocol, and then bandage the eye, and apply a plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and fold each in four, and then place one on top of the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then bind it over with a firm bandage, and repeat the cupping glasses to draw out moisture without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night, and if the liniment softens, then you must bandage it tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and night, and if you see the eye improving, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the liniment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of a swollen membrane When a rupture occurs in the swollen membrane, then it opens, and papers come out like grains of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see it split, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper one, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the tear part; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle in place;
then cut the double thread and tie a part of the membrane around, and pull it well, then remove the needle and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the membrane, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constrained by the membrane on all sides with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives great appearance, pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, and let the white moisture flow and the eye descend, and enter immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling which is gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the operation is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top to your eyes; then let it be fixed, and the light not descend and be obscured, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a thin spatula and cut on the cornea a little along the conjunction of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the iris, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then instill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then let it be treated with another cure until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have already mentioned the similarities of the waters in the division, and what is needed to pierce them; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and squeeze it very tightly;
then put the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the cornea by the thickness of a hair in that white of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" skillfully, and turn your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be to the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal membrane, and then put the instrument to the place where the water is, then squeeze it out one way after another.
if the water descends immediately, then the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards, rest a little, and if the water rises the second way, put the force with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, then extract the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put back in water a little rock salt, and lift with that the eye inside. Then put on the outside of the eye tampons or wool moistened in rose oil and egg white, and bind with a healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, put on top crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which here is the form:
And pierce then only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a small opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, where he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movement, and let him take light foods, and let him not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark room, and test his sight, and let him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a warm abscess appears, you should unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with something that relieves the abscess;
and when it is calmed, unbind the sight and put on his face a small bandage to cover it for a few days, and let him always be in that dark room.
And then he should leave the house little by little, and return to his usual activities;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made pierced almonds, from which one sucks the water, but still I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almonds, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and let them be properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same subtlety, and the end in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various fleshy growths arise on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are some where there is ingrained flesh of a dark color, and there is soft flesh of a good color. In that, then, of these fleshes which is soft and not ingrained, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that, then, of these fleshes which is soft and not ingrained, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the onion on those fleshes, and pull them out forcefully; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if anything remains which cannot be cut, then work it all out with subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains there; and if suppuration or abscess occurs, treat it as is necessary;
and if it is malignant abscesses, hasten and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour in vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not break through as it should, know that there is dead flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, knotted at both ends, with a finger's breadth or less between each knot; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as much as possible, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and many times children do this at school, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and saw the one after the other along the knots that are in the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put in the nose a lead tube for some days until it is healed, and if there is need of drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for cleansing the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit also;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to cleanse the head;
and have a handle at the head to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large constantly, until it is a frightening thing to behold;
and therefore it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, and insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not livid in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut away, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous works, it benefits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must scrape all the parts of their heart until they bleed, then bring together the two lips with a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on powdered dragon's blood and powdered incense; and place on top of the powders a piece of strong plaster or another soldering plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is that you bring together the edges: or with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the abdomen; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
In many men, there occurs within the lips a hard abscess, similar to vesicles, some smaller and some larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and incise over each one, and take it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with drying things until it is healed.
Many times there grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the wound or blood run;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and desiccative powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after cautery;
Sometimes there are gathered at the roots of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs which are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be in your lap, and clean the teeth or the scabs that appear, until nothing remains; and thus do so for the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if one removes what is there at the first scraping, that is good; if not, then begin again the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth require various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one cleans the outside of the teeth have other forms than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and ready with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this readily; for it is a very serious matter until one has no excuse for extraction.
Then, when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he believes it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to those skilled in this art;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, it is necessary that you scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly attach the forceps; and let the patient's head be safely between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it will not come out easily, take one of these instruments and insert it inside on each side lightly, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, it is necessary that you fill it with lint where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pain than the first returns to the patient because of the wickedness of the root.
And beware that you do not act as ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have recounted;
but sometimes cause great illness through the injury of that which remains of the roots, or through the tooth that they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is drawn, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first loosens teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold the loosened tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains during extraction, it is necessary that you apply cotton soaked in butter to the area for one or two days, until the area is softened, then place the forceps called "algefri," whose head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these forceps, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and place there the instrument which is called "althali," that is to say, a lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out because of it, it is good;
if not, help yourself with all the instruments, whose forms come afterwards:
And one helps oneself with this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and of other tools which are in front in the fashion of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments with teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds by himself his instrument, according to what his work and the illness shows him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks nothing of the cartilage or of the other bones, or if it rots, then he searches among the instruments which are necessary, which I have told you, and he helps himself with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and strong to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that one can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with suitable medicines, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural course, and the shape is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is behind the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot file it or grind it:
then shave it; and if it is joined with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it resembles a small beak, and let it be of iron, sharp at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that one can file it, then file it with a file such as this is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then plane it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it wounds the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not wound the tongue nor impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot bite into what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this does not work;
then it is necessary to restrain them with a gold thread, for silver threads turn green and rot, but gold never changes;
and let the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and double it between two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you skillfully reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then start the wrapping again until the point where you began, and pull your hand subtly and skillfully, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tight as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
it will remain and serve thus its whole time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of the two healthy teeth, and the two moved, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one replaces it in its place, again and again, as we have said;
and let not one who is not wise and patient meddle with it, and sometimes one makes the form of a tooth from cow bone, and one places it in the place where it is lacking, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this ligament, which comes from under the tongue, is natural, that one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold his head in your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament broadly, until the tongue is freed from its restraint, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from a sudden wound, then put a hook there and cut broadly that ligament;
and take care that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is underneath;
and when you have done, raise the area with rosewater and vinegar, or with cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient dress it each night, so that the wound cannot close.
And if bleeding occurs, put crushed vitriol on the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed,
and if you see it of a dark or black color or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is inclined to become a whitlow, and there is moisture, put on onion, and open it with a fine spatula, and cleanse it on one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you have removed all the pus;
then raise the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come within the throat swellings which are called "godath", and they are properly called the two almonds, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take heed:
if this abscess is hard, of little feeling, and of a dark color, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a round white color, and the root is thin, then have the instrument prepared for cutting, but first see if the warm abscess rests and is calmed.
Then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be in your lap, and the operator opens the mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, which resembles a pair of forceps; and however the ends are curved, and one opposite the other, and are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pincers, of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision let the patient gargle with warm water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water, in which pomegranate bark is cooked, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them in the same way as the two almonds equally.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had forced out two roots through the two nostrils.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large portion of pus;
then I did likewise in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the hook into the abscess, and cut a part of it, and there issued forth only a little blood; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again constantly, and filled the place that I had emptied, until it was very large;
then I cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uvula".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round, gathered and not long; and it is bloody or of a dark color or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention above; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And you should not cut more than the superfluity which is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you harm the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient fears the cutting, then you should use a method of cauterization so that he feels no fear.
And the manner of the cautery is with sharp fire. And it is that the patient put his head in your lap, and then press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with hot, live fire, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and employ the tip of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And it has on the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and puts the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient be lying on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine inside, so that it does not descend to the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the quantity of half an hour, until you see it numb and the burning from the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the mouth above, until the cotton rests on the uvula;
and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then let it dry, and it falls after four or five days.
And if you need to repeat the cauterization with the medicine, then repeat it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton wrapped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and let it be rinsed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and oats and similar herbs, and mix them all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot have a tube made in this manner: And let it be of silver or of bronze, and let one of the ends be placed in the mouth of the patient so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is deadened;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula dries, and take care that you do not do this at the beginning of the onset of the hot abscess, for many things happen there; and do not do this except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, then take a tube and put inside the head an eggshell, so that the mouth of the patient does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to harm the mouth, and this is a good treatment and also salvation.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
then it is necessary that you pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument towards the sun, so that you may see the thing move;
and what does not appear to you and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; perhaps the thing will come out backwards through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will stick, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it may more easily enter the throat, and have the head lifted up; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough come to him, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient insert the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is stuck; if he pushes it down, or pulls it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
Of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the treatment of medicines; and when that does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight, then press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps which are good for this.
And if that is not effective, take a horsehair, and put it into the patient's throat, then put a hot iron on the end of the hair, and do this often. And let the patient drink water every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I described in the fumigation of the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole is the end of the instrument;
then throw your fumigation in it, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and do not drink water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one draws the leech is, when one can see it, similar to curved pincers to enter the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a rough, file-like surface, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what is subsequently recalled of one and another in this book, and they differ in perforation and in size;
and this is in two ways, one being in its very appearance, and what it contains of moisture.
And the second manner is because of the places where they are in the body.
For an abscess of the head is different from one of the fundament, and an abscess in fleshy tissue is different from one that occurs in joints, and each has its own treatment.
And there are abscesses which one should not pierce, until the boil is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are grown, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess occurs near the joints, and it is left until it is rotten around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or, if the abscess is near a principal member, and you delay perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not necessary that you pierce an unripe abscess without complete digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply and become elongated within, and a fistula form there; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time of perforation of a ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is appeased, and the departure of the fever, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you must make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears softened;
and let the perforation be along the length of the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no danger. In those that bend, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and depths of it will harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced along the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many slits according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and cut; when it has become like a rag, and is mortified, it is necessary to do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some which one cuts like the leaf of myrtle, like abscesses of the groin;
and there are some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those which have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, not to draw all the pus at that time, but to draw out a part; then stop up the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Approach this chapter therefore with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, then cleanse the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a clean incision, then apply tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then it is necessary that you put a tent in each one so that they meet one another;
and if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have shaved it around, then you must fill it with old cotton or linen shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and moisten a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and care, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must apply tents and cloths moistened in hot wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, then you must apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the scalp come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are in webs, like the honeycomb of a hen, and there are many similar ones.
There are fatty ones and those where there is moisture, like boils;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is such that you probe with the instrument called an "entromissoire," whose form comes afterwards, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then lance it from above lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it without leaving anything of the skin that contained that moisture, for it returns constantly when one leaves anything there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will drain what remains of the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains of the night;
then treat the wound with suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick pus, cut it lengthwise according to this form; and insert your ointments, and scrape it from all sides, and use all your skill to draw out the pus where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And do the same with the abscess if it is stony, and with the cutting and cleaning as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as well as from a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except for those which come at the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the matter may flow out;
and treat them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body, and they are many, and are interconnected with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own compartment, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofula are many.
and the appearances of these scrofula are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey treatment.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves on every side and is not close to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the windpipe, and is not deep;
then you must cut it from above, and scrape it from each side, and spread the two lips of the wound with the fingers, if you need to, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp nor cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and that does not allow you to work, then put in the wound ground vitriol, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to suppurate.
And when the bleeding is stopped, then return to your work, until you have completed it;
then seek with your index finger if there remain any small scrofulas, cut and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then it is not necessary that you cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the whole scrofula, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, provided that there is no superfluity remaining because of the size of the scrofula. then it is necessary that you take care to cut its root, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then it is necessary that you take care to cut its root, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas which contain superfluity, pierce them where it appears ripe;
and pierce it as the one previously mentioned, depending, then administer tents with ointment and similar things, so that it consumes what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that one not make aid by that, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are near to those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss which comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we wish to split the epiglottis, we should split it below three or four circles a small fissure across, between the two circles or by the amount of the fissure of the tonsil, not in the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with all the hook, then split the skin until he reaches the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the tonsil, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm of the channel which leaps out through the place which is broken, and by the failure of the voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed of which one doubts the strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely swollen, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the shortness of breath. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for that reason the ancients ordered leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three days or in four. And then they ordered sewing the wound and healing, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife, and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to heal her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had flowed from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or duct except the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and there happened to the young lady only that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her usual state;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called a "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess the color of a yolk, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or natural has no remedy.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one resembles fat to us, and the other kind resembles an abscess which comes from an artery to us; and there is fear, and it is not necessary to work with hot iron except in that which is small, and prove and search with the whole introducer: if you find it like a nut of fat, and it does not adhere to any vein, cut it, as one cuts nuts, and draw it out whole with its shell, if there is any; and search well all around, and treat it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
Many kinds of nuts there are, of which I will tell all the similarities;
And now it is necessary that I tell all the difference that is between a nut and an issue.
I say that an issue is heat and persistent fever, until the boiling is past, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and the heat subside.
With the nut there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains pus, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a swelling, and grows large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy, or moist, and very diverse in color as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the nut, that you first examine it with the instrument which is called "entromissoire," according to what its form will be in the chapter which follows.
And the manner of the examination of abscesses is that you take the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then that it should be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the instrument, and take care of what comes out.
If running moisture is present, whatever color it may be, treat it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if after the instrument no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, then cut it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it on each side and guard the membrane in which it lies so that you draw it out whole with the nut;
and if you cannot draw it out whole, then draw it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the nut returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and clean the wound, and apply soothing warm poultices, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the nut is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with what generates flesh.
and if the beating vein is contrary to you or otherwise hastens you, fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut away what remains of the nut.
Here are the forms of the surgical instruments, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for encircling abscesses of fistula;
and they are like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead for encircling the curves of fistula;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds as well;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these introducers, the blades are set in handles, so that the patient does not feel them at the opening of the abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a quince peel, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and it is sometimes placed in the place which heals the cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must lance them according to this form, from this line b. down to g.: then scrape the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops, and is softened by its size as happens with women, cut it in two parts above, through two similar incisions; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining flesh and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat it with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, cut it as we have said in the incisions of scrofula, and if the wound discharges matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is healed, many times an abscess results, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one knows it thus when it is because of the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
and when it is because of the vein, it is round and apparent on the outside;
and it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and in the neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to avoid the treatment with iron, and that which is at the head must also be avoided, and in that which is an arterial swelling, it is cut above the skin lengthwise;
then make the incision with the hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle underneath, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw the artery out with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples;
then prick the place which is between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
then apply the treatment that generates pus, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can, along with the skin, then place the needle under the place that you hold with your hand, and make it pierce, and have a double thread there, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the ligature on one of the two sides at the two ends of the thread;
and if you fear that the threads might come out, then push another needle with a thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and pull the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the core and leave that which is tied;
then put on a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by too much hard work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and the fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in many conditions without pain;
and when it is squeezed strongly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well in all directions, and it does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance, there would be a contraction; and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, lift it with a hook, and peel it, then remove it and close the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the abdomen and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its resemblance, and its root is thin, and its head large;
and there are small ones and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the lump is white and moist and of thin root; if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready.
if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the lump with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the lump, and it falls away through it without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting even for the belly, but you can well cut half, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then cure the wound, and be careful not to cut the small swelling which is of a livid color and of poor sensation and of milky appearance.
For this is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the cure of cancer afterwards.
when the boil bursts forth If the appearance of the boil comes from a cauterized wound or a fissure of the fascia, and is on the belly and some of the boils come forth, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is by the rupture of the fascia and by the protrusion of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and opens with diverse issue. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it goes back in, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and increases greatly at the beginning of the bath and through hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and opens well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscesses appear large and hard through these signs, and are fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look if the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look if the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and because of the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie completely straight, then bleed all around the swelling; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the place you have marked with all the spatula, then extend half of the abscess upwards with all the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the tie be secure;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the tie, and put your index finger there, and search for the intestine; If you find it caught by the tie, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and thread two strong threads, and place the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you made pierce;
then tie the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it festers, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as is necessary, and sew up the place.
Of the cancer We have described in the division the types of cancer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid the iron treatment;
and we say that cancer grows in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be excised, such as cancer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning;
nor did anyone ever heal any before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile sometimes;
then make him bleed if he has manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then apply your ointments to the cancer, and shave the hair from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, then cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the types of dropsy, and in what manner the collection of water is made, and the signs of each type, and the treatment which is done by medicines, and that which is treated by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarca, for it is a mortal thing;
then when you treat this type of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment is not effective, see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness besides dropsy, such as cough and diarrhea and similar things; do not touch with iron there, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong constitution, and he has no other illness than dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you should work thus: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and press his belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot injure it;
then look if the dropsy is swollen towards the intestines: if so, you must make three incisions above the groin, straight down from above the hip; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be on the left of the groin, three fingers wide;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities run to that weak place;
then pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the syfac as in flaying, to the extent of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the syfac until the spatula reaches the empty space, and this is the place of the water, then pull it out, and insert this instrument, of which this is the shape: And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and is made of bronze or light iron, and has at the bottom end one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the dissolution of his vital spirit, or he will faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength signify, and his pulse;
then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the hole which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then restart the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering that, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this for a few days, and be careful not to be foolish until there remains only a little water.
And if you are doubtful about the patient, and you leave too much water, then treat him with a hot poultice or sand, and by much sweating or bathing and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that it be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then place in the opening a thin lead tube, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, let the tube be removed, and let him urinate, and then put it back;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes forth will not leave it closed.
He whose opening is small, is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis upward; and cannot reproduce because the matter cannot reach the womb, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies often on his back, then they straighten the head of the penis and cut it like the quill of a pen, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of the flow of blood which often comes there, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these whitlows come on the penis, and it is an ugly appearance of flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not;
then you should take them with a sharp lancet, and cut and cleanse them all, then apply moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a foul color and fetid, then you must apply cautery to it.
When you have incised it, and if the whitlow is on the finger, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the whitlow that is inside first; and when it is removed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the finger is not safe from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the finger and the testicle;
it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from the bark of pomegranates and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps with both dispositions together: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, it is necessary that you insert into the urethra a lead tube, and the patient urinates through it;
and when the skin is drawn over the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or abscess, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the binding is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is too difficult to remove this, it is necessary that you scrape it with a spatula, a little bit of the head of the penis and of the skin;
then separate gently the two, and place there a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water, so that it does not close again.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not describe the circumcision of their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around I dal, and forcefully, and with a whole scalpel;
the heart would flee because there are two membranes, and by chance one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it is necessary to cut it, and the pain is doubled, and the purification which is of the dal is not assured by the point of the member;
and in the purification of the nail, the iron sometimes slips, and the work is spoiled, and often they are born thus that they have no need of purification, and I have seen it.
Of the purification which is done forcefully with a linen thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the forces cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single time; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him rejoice in all the ways that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and place the threads between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and blow on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little tie to another;
then cleanse it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little tie to another; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour by the little finger and the index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on, and on the powder a cloth glued with a mixture of cooked egg yolk thinned with rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two ends should be sharp and cutting, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error of cleansing is when the pus flees at the incision;
then you must spread it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the swelling of the abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as much as you can move, and guard the part of the penis, this will not harm it at all.
Then treat the place of things inside a wound with powder, which we have said in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts too deeply into the heart and it goes to the top, it will not harm;
then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from obstruction by stone, or congealed blood, or bowel, or dead flesh, or similar things, which we have said in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be bent over on his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should restrain his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and let it be of fine silver, lightly feathered, like the feather of a bird; and let the tube be a palm and a half long, and let it be slender at the end.
And the manner of the evacuation of urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and penis with warm oil, olive oil, and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty thing, and this is not done according to this order except because the conduit where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out completely, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When abrasions or blood come into the bladder, or putrefaction is gathered there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines, do so with the instrument which is called a “clepsydra,” and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the hollow through which the medicine flows should be such that it stops the penis well without addition, so that one may draw out the moisture, and insert it when necessary;
And when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the catheter in the moisture, and draw with the drawer which is inside;
you will draw the moisture with the catheter, and then forcefully push the drawer back in; then the moisture will enter, and will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or of tin, and the head is higher;
and below is a tube where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it between the two tubes firmly with a good double thread, and slightly heat that liquid over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it roundly all around; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already spoken in the division of the types of stones, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have spoken of the difference between the stone formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stone one should operate on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is formed in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then stiffens; and in many of these, the anus leaks;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in the elderly, and it is moderate in young adults, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the extraction of the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from its higher position;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then search for and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, hasten now to cut into the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it into his rectum, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, guide it to the neck of the bladder;
then press down on it with your finger, and push it to the outside where you want to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to lift the testicles with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the shape: And cut between what is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but to the left side of the perineum;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and the incision should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps press with the finger that is in the rectum, so that it comes out without effort;
and know that there are stones which have angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
Therefore, for one with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, it is necessary that you extract it with forceps which are like a file at the head, to move the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin instrument curved at the head;
and if you cannot manage it thus, enlarge the hole a little, and if the blood flows, restrain it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, put the largest one first at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the small ones afterwards if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly leaks because the wound cannot heal;
but nevertheless try to pull it out, or break it with tongs, until you extract it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place on top a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rosewater and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then support the patient on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, irrigate the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions appear in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in this way that it comes out with the urine without a jump: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will run to the bladder, and rot it;
then clean the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and help it in every way that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and lodged inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it as I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the incision by this treatment. I have already proven this so.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
then insert the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill in the stone with your hand little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
Of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three reasons:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will uncover herself to the physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art nearby;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is deeper than the stone in a man, wherefore a deeper incision is necessary, and there is great danger. And if necessity demands this, then you must take a skilled female physician, and one scarcely finds them, and if you do not find one, at least seek a subtle chaste physician;
and present to her a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows some part of the art, and instruct her to do what you instruct her concerning the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should compress it beneath her finger, and instruct the patient to place her finger in her vagina, and press her left hand strongly against the bladder.
If she finds it, then she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the groin;
then cut towards the stone at the groin towards the middle of the vagina, where the muscle is prepared, and the stone is felt in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the first incision be small;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the first incision be small; then put the instrument into the incision, if you feel the stone then enlarge the wound so that the stone can come out, and know that there are many types of stones:
that is to say, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and those which have roots.
so know the similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, then put crushed vitriol in its place, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of the stone in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery which is cut, then put the powder on the place and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not recommence that, and leave the stone and do not extract it, lest by chance the patient die; then cure the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is subsided, and the place is dried, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
Watery hernia is nothing else than an assembly of moisture or white humor, which is under the skin of the scrotum, which contains the testicle;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the testicle, so that one thinks that it is another testicle; and that is the skin of the scrotum between the white humor that we have mentioned;
and this happens only rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is in the white membrane that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, somewhat long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because there is moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper tunic, the abscess is round with a part of the testicle, and therefore it is thought to be another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with a completely square probe, of which the form is shown above. According to that then which comes after the probe, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his ability and the repletion of his body;
then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and place many cloths underneath him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart near the testicles;
then take the prepared spatula, and cut the skin of the scrotum along its length to near the handle, and let your incision be straight in separating the skin of the scrotum to the white fascia, and peel it carefully as much as you can;
then pierce the fascia full of water with one large hole, and draw out all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the testicles themselves, but only the fascia; cut all or parts of it carefully on the side, because if you do not cut it skillfully, the water will return;
and if a testicle jumps out during your work, replace it in its place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the scrotum with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, to prevent the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if water is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool moistened in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool moistened in rose oil; and put on top more wool moistened in wine and oil, and place it over the two testicles, and put on top doubled cloths, and bind it all up with a bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this image and let them be joined by sewing at the opening of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the fundament to the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two angles, and let the whole bandage be fastened in the loop of the breeches;
and sometimes this area is treated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cauterizing instrument, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white layer that contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that layer with the awl, and scrape it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you have scraped it all away;
and take care that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this procedure is safer; and more careful to avoid blood loss, and gentler than cutting procedures;
and if anything goes against you, whether an abscess, or bleeding, or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not want to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are certain by the signs that we have mentioned that watery humor is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the hole be wide, so that all the water may run out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and let the remaining water drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
And if the white linen does not allow the water to escape from the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from the dropsical, the form of which is given above;
and enlarge the wound a little, and know that the water returns and collects after six months or thereabouts, and when it is collected as before, and thus the patient will pass his days.
Know that in the section of this branch there is fear in many cases, wherefore it seems to me that it is better to leave it;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come in the body, and especially in the testicles; and this is due to many causes.
That is to say, by an excess of sour and sharp humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from a blow;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it finds no pain, and it is a serious abscess;
and perhaps some abscesses are serious, dangerous, and suppurating, and of a livid color, and sometimes come from an artery, or from a vein swelling.
When it is from an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and it is not necessary that you touch it.
That which is made from a vein swelling is known by its disposition to expression from the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision on this and other similar flesh; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the egg upwards, and draw the white sheath strongly, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the egg.
If the egg is already soldered with the neighboring flesh, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg, and cut it;
and if it is attached to the sheath, or in that which is within the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, then it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the egg, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you how to treat it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then place the suspensory of the testicles below your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the penis, and let your master hold them, and extend them firmly;
then cut with a sharp, wide spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples;
then insert a needle with double thread, and tie it at the first point where the pus appeared, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted humors;
then treat the wound like the others where one inserts a tent, so that no vessel is cut which nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, it is necessary to draw out the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the section which happens in the scrotum, or the extension over the belly in the groin area, because of which the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either in the scrotum, or from the extension of it, and these two types come from many causes:
from a blow, or a jump, or a fall, or lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the extension of the scrotum, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the swelling is even down to the bottom, because the scrotum presses on the intestine.
And the sign is that when it is from the rupture of the scrotum, it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the swelling is variously apparent, under the skin near, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine and the body at the bottom of the scrotum.
And sometimes the testicle descends with the intestine, and is held there, and causes the patient great pain to suffer, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore one must be wary.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into place with his hand into the wound, if he can return it; then let it be supported at its neck between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then stretch the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert hooks into the edges of the wound according to what you need to open the wound, and let them be such that the egg may come out;
then peel the fascia which is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move your right hand into the scrotum, and stretch the white fascia upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and loosen that which is behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, then put it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and put it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the groin, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the fascia, of which we have spoken, which is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature of two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter, lest an abscess should form there; and place the ligature again according to the first ligature, two fingerbreadths from it; and after these two ligatures, leave of the fascia which is under the skin of the scrotum the width of one finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle bears;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood runs, and the bowel, as we have said before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound, and apply the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be sprinkled with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with other treatments, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the branch which is next to the vein, in such a manner that you tie the vessels, after cutting above or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess with those who operate, until the vessels bleed;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if some do descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and yet if it remains too long in this state, the wound or fistula grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the sheath which is at the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place softens and swells and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture, wide according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the sheath which is under the skin that follows it, then take a root and put it on the apparent place of the sheath;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the sheath over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then extract the head of the root, and do not cut the sheath nor extend the egg nor anything else, as I have let you know in the treatment of the hernia of the intestines; then cure it by the cure of wounds.
then cure it by the cure of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sheath is constricted, and there is no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is gentler in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the scrotum skin
Many times the scrotum skin is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is ugly to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin from the natural skin;
then bring the two lips together with a suture, and if you wish, first cut away the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread comes out.
Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon knows how to respond when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand until they are retracted and you feel them no more.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut on each testicle with one cut, when you have well skinned them;
and leave some pouch of the tunica vaginalis and the thin membrane which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by pulling, because in pulling, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, wherefore the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes the urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and she has above the vulva something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and cure it like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine escapes through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tenesmus is a growth added to the natural part, so that it is too ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you hold the superfluity of the tenesmus in your hand or with tongs, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood come from it, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and another growth that arises at the mouth of the womb, and fills it, and perhaps bursts forth, and is in the likeness of a cow, and for this reason the ancients called it "cow disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tenesmus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the nature of the woman is not perceived, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come to it;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come to it; or it is by added flesh, or by a thin or thick septum, and is made deeply in the womb, or on the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the having of menses;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vagina.
If the stoppage is near, I search with my fingers or with a probe.
If it is of a thin septum, and it is near the two lips, then hasten, and break it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and the woman should be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the thin septum is broken, and the stoppage is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it may not heal.
And if the septum is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the stoppage is of raw flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then apply a wide lead splint, so that the wound cannot heal;
and so it should be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then let it be cured with other treatments until it is healed.
And when in the wound comes new flesh, then it is necessary to cut it according to this manner, unless it is festering abscesses. For a festering abscess which is in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood often flows, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become swollen.
and we have already said in the division the similar things of these, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swellings, when they are deep in the wound and do not appear to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the wound, that one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then grasp the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that staunch blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if a flow of blood occurs, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it and put it on her back.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without cutting;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess is healed, treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said of the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses arise in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscess and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which comes in the sea, which is not of the abscesses which collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is lessened;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet together at the outer parts of the legs;
and let his thighs be spread, and put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good band;
then suck him towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the form follows;
and it is necessary that when you see this instrument administered, that you first insert a probe to know the depth of the abscess, so that that which enters the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he put the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is opened, and one feels it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, at the spatula-like point;
and when the boil is emptied, it is necessary that you place in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dry green oil;
and place the tent deep within the abscess, and place on the outside of the abscess and on the wound clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been cooked;
then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the abscess and the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then of water in which lily roots and long birthwort have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden in the abscess, then you must refrain from cautery with iron, but treat it as we have said in the chapter.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the form of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman straining downwards, and desiring to push.
then the child hastens to come out; then know that that childbirth is according to the natural form, and the exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet first, and the body or head and hands are forced out, or it comes on its belly, or sideways, and is perhaps twisted around its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and subtle in these things, and beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes head first by natural issue, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a saddle, where the women hold her;
and anoint her nature with oil or fenugreek which has been cooked, and then let the midwife put between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: and split the secundine, and cut with her nail until the moisture which is inside runs out;
and grasp the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil;
then make her sneeze and cough with a potion, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, then it is necessary that you gently replace them little by little; and if they cannot be put back in, then put the woman on a chair, and raise her feet upwards; then bring the chair down to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is brought down;
and if the hands cannot be put back in, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is placed here in front, and extract the child, and replace them equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes down to the thighs, then instruct to grasp it, and make it sneeze with a potion; if it jumps further, if God wills.
And if it does not go further as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to the natural form. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take mallow mucilage, and linseed oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put it on the woman's vulva and melt this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to the ribs;
and when she is softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it below, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and squeeze her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will jump out immediately.
of the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this way, the midwife should put her hands in little by little; then let it be supported by its neck, and its feet hanging down, and let it lie on a bed; and bend its hands little by little, and then take its hands over its belly, and remove the cushions from below, until it is positioned downwards; and if the child does not come out, take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands in; and draw the child out little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child that comes from the womb, a hand appearing first It is necessary to contrive to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman stand up and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and raise her legs strongly;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on a seat, then work at bringing back the hand; and draw the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit over its neck, and its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when it is even, then apply to the place a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner with all the afterbirth
in this same manner with all the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with all the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, then cut it from the buttocks, so that it is not retained, and the child dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as is fitting, and instruct the woman that she should take herself sometimes:
Of the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two is a strange thing, and they do not live, except very few;
Two is a strange thing, and they do not live, except very few; I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by the syfac which divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single one, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat them as we have said, and let the hand be subtle, and do quickly and lightly what she does; and do so as it is worth moving to salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the wise glorious, and the hand must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; then do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with your hands; it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined down, and her legs raised;
and the assistant hold her from two sides, or she be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek mucilage and linseed, then oil her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then put them into the womb lightly, then find a place where she puts the ointments that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
then insert the ointments into its eyes or into its neck or into its mouth or onto its palate or under the chin or into the clavicle or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, then insert them into the heel and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the ointment with his right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and put it in with his whole hand lightly, and insert the ointment into one of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then insert another ointment against it, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then spread it equally by moving from one side to the other, so that the pus comes out, and let the ointments be toothed to hold the pus, as the shape is here:
And if some remains, let him moisten some of his fingers with oil, and put them into that part, and draw out the other part;
and if any remains, put this ointment on a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot bring it back because of the tightness, then you must wrap it in a cloth until it all comes out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or it has an accumulation of watery fluid in the head, then you must put the pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the head and draw out the water; or you round it with the instrument that is called "almidach", the form of which comes with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is extracted with the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the worst part issues forth;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and open the belly or chest, until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand deep into the womb, and draws it out to the mouth of the womb; then puts in one or two fingers, and pulls it strongly;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted by a hot abscess that has formed there, then you must not work there, but must administer moist and oily things; and apply plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then administer what we have said for a living child;
and if one does not have the power, then pull it out forcefully piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if a flow of blood comes, then it should be put in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was conceived upon that one, and the other was also dead. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly suppurate.
I was called to the treatment, and I thought about it for a long time, and could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after some days another. I was very surprised, because the womb has no bones.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I cleaned the wound, and extracted more bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little pus always came out of the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only because, when the master finds something strange, that he should know how to provide help.
After this comes the form of the press, with which one binds the books;
and with two turnings at the two ends of the two bands. However, the horns should be more slender than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the opening of the wood should be one inch wide, and the edge of the boards one inch, and one and a half palms long; and between the two bands should be two additions of this same wood, which should be fastened to one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are inserted into the opening of the trepan to open when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar but more slender and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of tongs; and have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two inches wide;
and when you wish to open the trepan with the whole instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then put the two attached additions into the trepan, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, just as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount that you wish to open the mouth of the trepan, until the opening does what it should.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the surgeon has prepared them, the work is all the quicker, and higher for men because of their quantity.
Do not despise the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessities are not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained in childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a potion, and press your hands to her mouth and nose; and if it comes out because of this, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water in the pot over the fire;
then put one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and hold it there until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the secundines come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to wet her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then put it into the vagina, and search for the secundines; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently extend it straight, so that the womb does not fall during extraction;
but it should be moved lightly to the right and to the left, and then pulled; then it will come and detach itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is too narrow, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, be careful not to be rash in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then you administer a clyster of tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and come out.
But nevertheless, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and the head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested a fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass similar to a funnel, and one puts the narrow end into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be on the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but it is stopped up by a thin membrane: then it is necessary for the midwife that she pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and she must be careful that she does not injure it;
then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead tube in the opening and leave it there for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to use the toilet.
And sometimes this obstruction comes suddenly from a wound or an abscess; then it is necessary to cut that obstruction. then it should be treated, as we have said with the lead tube.
Fistulas which come from under the fundament are knotting, and swelling which come beside the fundament outwardly, or in the space of the two parts, then there is one fistula or several;
and when that knotting is old, it works, and then discharges white moisture or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are perforating;
and are known by this, that there comes out with the excretion or flatulence when the patient excretes, and by chance a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas which pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach as far as the joint of the thigh, and as far as the buttock.
And thus one knows the perforating fistula at the fundament, and not the non-perforating: and it is that you put your index finger in the fundament, and put a fine needle of bronze or iron in the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then put in a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or the hair at your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there is no discharge of excretion or flatulence or worm from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not perforate; then hasten to the cure.
And when the fistula is perforating to the bladder or to the urinary duct, then the urine leaks out, and cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced to the hip joint, then the tent is coming to the place; if there is no tortuosity and the location of the pain around, it is that it always swells, and neither medicine nor healing by ointment helps;
and in these perforating fistulas there is no cure but labor, and the vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with them.
In that which is not perforating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and he lifts his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs inclined towards his belly; then place a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent comes.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is uncovered where you feel between your finger the pus or the flesh, then know that it is perforating; then do not work on it if it cannot be healed.
It is said however that one can heal some, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done, is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it very hot into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents soaked in butter, until that rotten flesh comes out, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is in the bottom, and there is between your finger and the tent a thick covering of flesh or of syfac, and you see the fistula at that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten fleshes that resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added fleshes, and the stanching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then cure it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place throws off pus, and the burnt flesh emerges in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that heal hard flesh, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula goes down to the bottom of the fundament, and is far from the body, put your finger into the fundament, and investigate that.
If you feel the tent, and between two is the membrane or the fascia or flesh, where it is about to pierce, there should be no fear but confidence and hope, through the administration of one of three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the fundament, and there is an evacuation against the will; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, either with a tent or another pointed instrument; then cleanse that rotten flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament: this will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are like this: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head in this way: And put one twisted thread into two, and put the tent with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the head.
If it is penetrating into the margin of the fundament inside, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger into the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between them, and they come together;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the ligation, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile espinous with which one opens the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the fundament, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the fundament and at the end of the fundament;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and constantly leak a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the flesh;
and the cure of those who have them inside the fundament, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the privy, until the fundament comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp it with tongs, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then grasp them with a rag, or with cotton, or a piece of chamois leather; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on some hot powders that are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then give the patient a clyster of a biting and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it may come out clearly; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with tongs, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that one fears the incision with iron. Then you must administer the suture according to this manner:
Then you must administer the suture according to this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and so it should be wide;
and pull the thread strongly, then knot the thread, and remove the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or cerate, and put it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the dryness of the feces or wound Often there is dryness of feces in the intestine, and by natural constriction, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or your fingernail the crust above, which does not allow it to moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is necessary;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping again more forcefully than before, until it bleeds much and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of the trembling Formication is a small, crawling sensation around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it feels cold, and it is felt as if dead from trembling, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and put that quill on the trembling, until the circle encompasses the trembling entirely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the trembling, and put it deep in, and pull out the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of bronze or iron according to this form, and let it be thin below and broad above: not pierced, so as to hold and press firmly with the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of tin, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those therefore which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those therefore which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wider above, where the belly is bound in this manner:
and there is an opening where the belly is bound, as you see, and the end is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal bladder or of parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each hole, then put into these holes a strong thread of raw thread twisted in an X or around, and assemble the belly as if it were a goatskin; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the attendant squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let him hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you clysterize him for a disease of bowel discharge, and the medicine quickly comes out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the rectum, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the skin is stretched:
We have, I said in the division, the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures by hand and by medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and what they are made of.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the blow of a sword and of a knife, or of a lance or of a stick or of an arrow, or of similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is still broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid fullness of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton moistened in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not exposed to the air, the powder that I will mention shortly;
and if the fire has exposed it, put on some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by tents, bring them together by suture, as I will say in the wounds of the belly, of the suture.
If the wound exposes the bone, and hangs, and only holds by a little, cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong meats, such as heads and cooked wheat, also like poultry, and similar things.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the putrid part, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and that you put in this powder which heals before the fire has moved it.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply it to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it dries well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it untied, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burn has not moved the wound.
And if the burn has moved the wound, especially in the summer, then one does not put this powder there;
but applies some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it sheds pus; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one on the head, but if the nerves of the neck or the artery are cut.
If it is the nerves, there is no other remedy than to leave the wound alone, and not to apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, such as warm washing in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked herbs also washed in fresh water, and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it at the lowest point;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding occurs, tie it off, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the throat’s [windpipe?], and do not touch the throat but reset it according to its natural form; and then bind it carefully, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search it; and if there are bone fragments, pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave them until the wound festers, and the opening is cleared and aligned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, see if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not apply the powder at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood be stopped in depth, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attracting ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to draw out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; thus there will be no spasm, nor tremor, nor ill heart constrictions, nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healed. Then treat it with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, always know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the chest or back, treat it as one would treat a wound on the front; if it is large, by suture;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has reached the bone, and has cut pieces from it, then clean the wound, and draw out the splinters if they are broken off; and if they are not broken off, let the wound fester, as this will facilitate their extraction;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, therefore their replacement;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, unless one puts them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they return more difficultly, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one more easily returns the intestine to its place than the others.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of the other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or you boil it in water with squinant and cypress and spikenard, and bathe the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the entry is easily closed;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, for no one should cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
cut inwards into the curvature and not outwards, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, put it back in its natural place according to its proper form, if you have the power, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, put your attention to that the injured part be higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what is prepared, then have between your hands a compassionate minister who holds all the rupture in his hand, and brings the lips together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one finger's breadth of space, and there stick a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the siphac, which is under the skin within, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two edges of the siphac, the four together;
then the tightening of a double thread around the needle from two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound evenly, and then leave one finger's breadth of space, and there stick another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to how many needles you need, until all the wound is closed;
and let the needles be medium-sized, between fine and thick, for the fine needles cut all the flesh, and the too-thick ones cannot enter well: therefore it is necessary that they be medium-sized;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far from the flesh and the skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the suture;
and then cut the heads of the needles, that they may not injure the patient while sleeping, and place tents or small cloths at the heads of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles suffice there.
The second suture is common, and it is that you join the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the muscle together with a needle on which there is a strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and place between each suture the thickness of a little finger;
This suture is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and the intestines protruded well two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was healed after fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, because I was in a place where one found none, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of suture:
take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through, leave the head of the thread where you put in the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inner part to the outer;
and the meaning of this suture is that you sew as furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread once on one side, and take it up again on the other, until the suture is completely finished.
The second method of suture, which Galen properly describes, is as some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the nearest end of the wound, and make it pierce that place only, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner, with the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce from the outer part to the inner, in two other places of the wound which are on the other side;
and this is the easiest and most common method of suture.
Galen says this, and some testify to it, that one should sew up the belly with two needles, with thread in each;
and one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is the same as the judgment of other wounds:
and that is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the fire has changed it, you must then replace the intestine and sew it;
then apply the flesh-healing powder, and if the fire has changed it, apply any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and let the threads be tied, and let the peritoneum and the viscera be joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you have no medicines, apply, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many situations when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound will affect the principal members, then you must moisten light wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the groins and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or putrefaction in the bowels, and this often happens, then give him clysters of warm red wine, and especially if the putrefaction reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine that is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the intestine protrudes from the wound, put it back in place like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must tie off the area that is black, so that no blood flows there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut that which is between the ligature, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound outside to facilitate extraction when the intestine falls, and the wound heals.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be repaired in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it became infected and developed a fistula, and the excrement and wind issued from it;
I applied a cure as best I could, and I did not cease to treat it until it was healed, and the place closed.
And when I saw it close, I feared that the patient had damage in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be treated in this manner: Take large-headed pins, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the pin has opened its mouth, place it over the two lips so that it constricts its mouth over them;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot loosen, then place another pin afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and sew the wound.
These pins are inserted into the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can also tie the intestine with a fine thread cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
Take the end of this intestinal thread that is very clean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread into the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it to the rupture;
and this method of sewing with pins is not certain except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy or cure, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it ages, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is haired and produces pus.
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a hardened, white, false knot, where one feels no pain, and is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, is necessarily one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because of the property in the region, digestion is slow, and healing is delayed, and it swells by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the treatments of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that occur in the large veins, and in the arteries, and in the nerves, or in the peritoneum, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in any joint of the hands or feet; and so there is one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you want to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin tent of lead, for lead bends easily around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then clysterize it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleans it;
then search it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and if it is deep, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the filth and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then cure it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight place, then you must cut deeply, as far as you can, then put in moistened tents in medicated water, and push them to the head of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that has remained at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that engender healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is uncovered, and there is corruption and blackness, then remove it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that engender flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and do not leave even one;
and if moisture hinders you, and there is no error or fear, then cut the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put something on the wound that encourages putrefaction, and leave it until the area is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will be removed more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only remove the corruption until all the blackness is removed, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it is necessary to saw and cut all the way to the corruption, and then cure it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example from it and it may help in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the materials came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open it;
but the physicians through their folly worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed from it, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated, and that which ran through the holes in a large stream; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellowish color.
I placed a tent in one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one led to another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption reached to the bone within;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with boiling medicines for a long time, and it would not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strived to heal the place; but I could not [heal it] until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and drew it out entirely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation he bled often, but he was healed entirely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good condition and had no harm or contrary at all, neither in going nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it must be treated in this manner: Take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is exposed, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another linen cloth thicker than the first cloth, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and stretch the head so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you wish to sew, so that the sewing does not injure the flesh;
and place a burning coal or a hot iron under the bone to cut away the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to sew as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and sew again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a burning coal underneath, and then sew from one part to the other the corruption, and let the suture be the length of the corruption a little, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and sew the bone where it remains on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that is a very serious matter, but nevertheless you must examine that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the incisions and the threads for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses; so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
The heads fester either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this means, or from the greater harm, which is the loss of the limb;
and the sign is that the limb turns black, so that it seems as if it were burned by fire, and it festers after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hasten to cut it, and if it is from the sting of some venomous beast, such as a sea scorpion or viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come down to the hand.
And if it comes down to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its own virtue;
and do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the next joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends into the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant pulls one of the ties downwards, and another assistant pulls the other tie upwards, and you sever the flesh that is between the two ties to a width of one span, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or saw it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and another lesion and abscess does not come to the patient.
And if profuse bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area immediately, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first came on his toe, until it affected the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned in a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied to him repercussive things after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion would not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I would not, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut his hand, that he would die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then breaks and bursts, and the pus flows out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin which is above is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "Sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so long that it reaches the bone in depth, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you have confidence that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
look if the abscess is large, and the pus that comes from it is foul-smelling, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and make it into a solution with water and honey, and clysterize the abscess, and extract the pus; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then extract it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the abscess is cleaned, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over it, then filter it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the abscess is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then clysterize with water and honey in which there is a little powdered litharge; or you may clysterize with honey and medicated wine, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine helps to dry the pus;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the abscess is well cleansed, then clysterize with that which causes flesh to grow there, and it is that you take diaphinite plaster, and mix it with rose oil and wine;
or you may clysterize with certain medicines and ointments, the properties of which I have described in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the abscess is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, widen it slightly with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too wide, sew it up, leaving only a space where the clyster can enter, and if the opening which discharges pus is above, cut it lower down.
and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest point, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there; and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, prepare it in this manner: that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the wound, and spread it on a linen cloth that covers the entire wound; then cut forcefully at the opening of the wound a little wider than before, then spread a soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the wound to drain the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once;
and the one that is over the opening of the wound, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, if it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take heed if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see the nature that oozes from the opening of the wound, know that the wound will heal, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom runs after a long time, do not despair of healing, for healing approaches.
For there are men whose flesh regenerates slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus emerges from the wound after many days, know that the wound will not heal;
and if the wound is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in effect, such as diaphinite ointment, for it contains a large portion of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
Take diaphinite ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose-water of old wine, equal in quantity;
then mix it and use it;
and this same is better cooked and thickened, when diaphinite ointment is not available, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey while it is over the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the wound, and sometimes one administers aristolochia longa, and roots of lily of the valley, which is like bean flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; then cure it as a fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or perhaps arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and no care is taken, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and throws out pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it will destroy it entirely;
and the corrosion goes to the bone, until there is foul pain, and the head of the finger is swollen, and the color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses the flesh inwards, and begins to prick and injure it, then you must put a thin blade under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply to the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove it all; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupted, cut it at the joint as previously described, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is wounded and swollen, and it causes great pain, then you must heal it first;
then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across the top, and take care that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, apply something that soothes.
The extra fingers that grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and sometimes there are bones in them, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their origin is in the knuckles of the fingers.
That which grows in any knuckle of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves;
the treatment of that which is fleshy is light, in this manner: cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: then you should avoid cutting.
In that which grows on the back of the finger, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable saw for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The joining together that occurs between fingers comes from birth, or from the closing of a wound, or from a burn, or from similar things.
Then you must cut that joining, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, so that they do not rejoin; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If a joining occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that joining as is necessary.
Varicose veins are large, swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair, then put him in the bath, and pour warm water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, heat it by the fire, and then cut it lengthwise along the vein from the knee to the ankle;
then open the skin with an incision, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it appears like a white cord;
then put the instrument underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then pierce it lightly with the lancet, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the instrument, as you have done, and pierce it with another lancet, as you did before;
then cut another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second incision;
then pull it out incision by incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull it out and lift it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put an instrument underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull it out or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must forcefully split it, but not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the intestine is curved, and does not cut, lest it cut the vein;
and is of great curvature, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms are generated between skin and flesh.
And if the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very great inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to come out, like the root of a plant.
When the head opens, it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two fingers' width, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time that a point comes out, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is all out; for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad illness;
for which reason it is necessary that it be drawn out little by little to the head, and that nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is drawn out, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it came out ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that all comes out;
and let the matter that is inside be emptied, and apply to the place medicines preventing putrefaction for some days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and there are many holes, and from which roots sprout;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body ascending and descending, and one feels it well in going from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and jumps out;
and is engendered by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and lumbríci and ascárides come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, perchance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and draw it out, then one can only remove it when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong ligature very tightly, then cut above and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does, is that it corrodes the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming in the head near the eye, then pull the eyebrow strongly from below it, then cut above, and draw it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily cleansing, with purgative medicines for the putrid bad humors, and to abstain from foods causing putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and shortly after, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it arrived in the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly turned around her body, as I saw it.
I greatly wondered how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had felt pain move from place to place, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and uncovered veins, and because of that, that constrained windiness appeared;
and it does not appear for the same reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then bind it above and below hastily, and then cut above until that constrained windiness escapes from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels windiness, such as fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are some which have large points, and small, and barbed, and smooth; and of those which have two angles, and of those which have tongues, and of those which are broken;
and that which strikes in a limb strikes in two ways: or in a principal member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then falls in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall tell you afterwards, appear: then you must beware of extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then I pull it out, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is above the brain is pierced, are when there is scotoma and swelling and dizziness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and there comes from the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and also something like shredded flesh;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs that the arrow has reached the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat, and syncope, come; know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the sign that the arrow has injured the lung is that frothy sputum comes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs loudly and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and he breathes heavily and has great pain and sighs; and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and some dung comes out through the ruptured intestine, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out and flows, and the patient feels strong pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the arm and the spine of the back and the ribs and the thigh and the legs, and similar members, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow fell into his tear duct at the root of the nose: I grasped it, and pulled it out from below the fat of the ear on the other side, and he was healed without harm.
And I extracted from a man an arrow which fell into the fatty tissue of the eye below the eyelid; the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabic one with barbs:
I cut the barbs, and worked so subtly that I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut on the arrow, and grasped it, and pulled it forth, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man to whom an arrow fell into the back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow fell, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without suffering great pain;
and many others similar.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning towards the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen in three days. So I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prickling and pain beneath his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the place, so that the place would not swell; and the place of the arrow appeared to me.
and the place of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus for a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put a corrosive watery medicine on the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that watery medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared to me visibly;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I put in the forceps, and moved it from one side and the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise methods of instruments, until I seized it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will be at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it, and I dressed the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely healed.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you apply your care to that which I do not say, for the book cannot contain everything;
but the wise master compares it with a very small thing, and from what is present and lacking, finds a new work, and a new instrument, for the resolution of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not exit the limbs into which they are fixed except according to two methods: either through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaping out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is rotten, and the exit is made easier;
and also if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, pierce around it with a thin drill, until the place around is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in the body so that one cannot see it, search for it with a tent. and if you feel it, pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein, cut it so that the wound is large;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, remove the flesh that is stuck in on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, for you would pull it out more painfully.
And if you cannot [pull it out] at once, leave it until the surrounding flesh is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, use what we have said in the treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can pull out the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
and position the patient in the way he was when the arrow entered him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it is visible, or the skin is swollen where it can be clearly seen or felt:
then cut above it, until the forceps can grasp it, and then extract it: if it jumps out immediately.
And if it is lodged in the bone, rotate your hand round and round until it enters the bone and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for a while, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, remove it with the entire shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer a push, administer a hollow instrument so that the point of the arrow enters the hollow of the instrument;
and then push it out, and if the arrow is hollow, push in a pointed instrument to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can, then treat the wound as is necessary.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is near the surface, and you can cut above it, cut it.
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like the feather of a bird, to push at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
There are 31 veins from which one is bled, of which there are 16 in the head, namely: Two behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries that are apparent in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "fast," and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "vein of the belly," and it is above the fossa, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which clearly appears above the wrist.
And the salvatory is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nose," which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrhs and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then press them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and put it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers breadth across, and let out blood as much as you wish;
then bind and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already mentioned incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples, is good for chronic migraine, and headache, and habitual ophthalmia, and for a flow of watery tears from the eyes;
and the qualities of bloodletting are as I said: and it is that the patient should strain his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from there;
then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and put the lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards, and cut it, as you did in the two other veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then unbind the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put on cotton; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as valuable as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the quality is that the patient should strain his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "fleam", of which this is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire; then unbind the patient's neck, and bind the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the operation is done with a wide fleam.
However, it is not necessary that the fleam be too sharp; and bleed across, because the bone is near, and perhaps the fleam will break when it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins that are in the two temples helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and earache in the ear, and the diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck by twisting with some ligature, as before;
then bleed, and let the bleeding be across, a little along the length of the fleam a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the fleam is thin, perhaps it will break;
then make the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for  water [disease?], and for raging thirst, and for facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that appears in the face, and especially when it is chronic;
and the manner of bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck, then you constrict his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin fleam, and insert it into the lip in the space that is between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear very well there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for one night, for it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two temples helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and many diseases, and impetigo, and toothache, and herpes, and fistulas;
and the manner of bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck under one side and the other, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein along a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is necessary;
then do likewise in the other vein, then untie the bandage, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of the bleeding of the lips Bleeding from the veins of the upper lips helps with a boil in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the quality of the bleeding is to make the patient sit before you, and bind his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is at the right lip and the other at the left, and one knows them by this that they are black, and by this that around them are small black veins:
cut then one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do likewise with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same manner.
Of the bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts his tongue, and looks under on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the neck from which one commonly bleeds are bled according to two methods:
either by pricking with a completely flat, myrtle-wood lancet, or an olive-shaped, fine one like a cutting knife, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide and fine according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle-wood lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is needed to open hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more finely pointed, and is for bleeding the fine veins, where there is fine, yellowish blood.
Bleeding of the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the abdomen;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleed wisely, and that he guard himself against the artery that is underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then he must staunch it, as I have said; and the lancet should not be pointed, but cutting like a knife.
And if the basilica vein does not appear clearly, then you must search for it, and choose another; or you want some branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut with a sharp lancet, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of bleeding, it is necessary that you extend the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with a sharp lancet; and beware that you do not injure the artery when you see the place swollen, for it is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is arterial blood: hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if it is the arm, tie it up, and leave it thus, and the patient should not move it;
and let there be fear, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not present, cut the artery if it is visible, for the head of it retracts; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of fig tree bark, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on tightly until the next day;
if the blood stops, it is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping is not difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the ligament of the arm.
The bloodletting of the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he be careful for the nerve that is below, and if he pushes too deeply, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men because of its subtlety, then you must bleed it with a lancet; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking the olive-colored vein or the myrtle-colored vein, for it is the safest of all veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one should seek the easiest place, and it matters not if one fails the first time, and one tries again; and perhaps the place swells in some men when one fails the first time, but it matters not.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your intention.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that bloodletting is administered only to preserve health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the arm: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed in the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting which is administered for illnesses has no set time, but when there is need, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years, nor a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor those with dropsy;
and one should be wary of bleeding after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and frequent intercourse with a woman, and of labor, wakefulness, and fasting, and that which diminishes strength, whether by something of the soul or of the body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and by medicines, if you have the power;
then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it, to refine the blood, and bleed from the vein of the arm near the third, as we have said;
and on that day guard yourself from work, and pain, and lust, and similar things;
and be calm and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature moderately above, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the blade with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when being bled, and there are some that are full of windiness, so that when one puts the blade on, it recoils from the blade, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be wise in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, it is good; if not, then begin again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it one or two days, and do not bind the arm: by chance, a hot abscess will come there;
nor enter a bath, then begin the bloodletting again if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you doubt that as much blood will come out as you wish, strike into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work somewhat hastily, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not begin the bloodletting again, and put on a little oil of lye, for it lightens the body of the blood, and lye is milder in this place than oil;
and thus administer the oil of lye in every bloodletting where you bleed the veins, to stanch the flow of blood;
and the same does treacle and ox-gall, when one puts it on the place; so it thins the blood and disperses it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms there, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled sufficiently except at that time when the opening of the vein is small, then hasten, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and a little warm vinegar, and squeeze it for an hour;
and you must do this after the flow of blood from the vein, and if there remains on the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mint, or the like.
And many times an abscess and swelling appear at the bleeding of the basilica vein:
then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the compression of the hand, then that swelling is bad. Avoid then that you put on nothing of what we have said, for by chance it might cut off the artery;
but make him a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw from each one blood according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full-blooded and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a wider incision be made, and the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should bleed little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bloodletting is safer from the flowing of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or breadthwise.
And to one whose body fails during bloodletting, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bloodletting bread soaked in spiced syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the release of much blood, then he should drink broth of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the section or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm, and bleed again, then it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bloodletting, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bloodletting, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to be bled from another place, should be bled on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a great quantity, and widen the opening until it reaches the pameson; Then, when you observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, that death not come in place of pameson, and this happens many times, when the phlebotomist is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you wish to untie the arm, and to let blood out a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is curved, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of a flame, until the blood which is frozen in the opening of the vein comes out strongly, and put on it a little salt mixed with water, and press upon it lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the arm is bled in place of the vein in the head because it is better composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the vein is red;
then it is moderately bound, so that the vein appears well, then bleed immediately across, not lengthwise or wide;
and let the opening be wide, and bleed very close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put there more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the method:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, entirely denuded of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is needed, put oil and wax on the vein to quickly seal it, and thus do for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphena vein is good for all the illnesses that are below the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and illness of the kidneys, and of the old thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs over the vein until it swells, and binds above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many veins run above the foot;
bleed then from the largest vein, or at the ankle, which is most effective.
And if you bleed it on the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed across as if cutting;
and let the blade be sharp.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot in water, and allow the vein to empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again a little higher up the second time, for the place is salty;
do not worry about a nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and bleeding it is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle with four fingers twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the location is safe, and it is very well-known to many men.
and it is better that you cut it, because the location is safe, and it is very well-known to many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and venesection is done in two ways: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this venesection which is without cutting is done in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and venesection which is done by cutting and by extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and the other is in the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping of the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and the cupping between the two arms; and the cupping of the two legs; and the cupping of the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bleeding from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, by necessity of illness, it is necessary to cup, or by custom, then let us administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and deaths and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temples helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not fitting that one of cold complexion use it, or one who has a catarrh, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not fitting that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who is often bled, becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping glass a little lower because of the danger of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for the constriction of the chest, and for the splitting of the windpipe, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
Cupping at the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to extend the patient's arm when applying the cups, so that he does not cut the artery, and blood does not flow excessively.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as [bloodletting from] the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins;
and instruct the bloodletter that he not go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and is below nerves and arteries.
The cupping glass which is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for the illnesses below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and be of bronze, that it has need of drawing well; and perhaps, if it were thin, it would break; and makes large wounds.
The cupping glasses of the legs are clearly beneficial, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the womb, and of the bladder, and restore the menses;
and are in place of the two saphenous veins, and of the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many instances.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease to do this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and replace the cupping glasses, and take care in the disposition of bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: then it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, then it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we wish to draw blood little by little, then one time is sufficient for us. And if we want a lot of blood, then we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart should be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily, or chamomile, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balm oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one whom you treat has tender flesh and large pores, it is not necessary to put any oil there, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And the one who has much moisture, let him rise with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise with old wine, or beet water, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not bleed with cupping before the bath nor in the bath, but after the bath, one or two hours;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be warmed, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chickens, and castrated-ram's meat, and moist meats.
and eat chickens, and castrated-ram's meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and the day that he is cupped, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after cupping, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not necessary that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping glasses which are applied without incision are those which are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the bladder and the kidneys and the hip, for those members do not tolerate being incised, and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another, just as we apply them to the breasts when the milk flows;
to remove the viscosity which is in the member, just as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the bladder to soften the member;
and removes the pain, when there is an obstruction or stone, so removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it does when one applies it to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained flatulence, and these cupping glasses are applied empty to suck only; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled for this.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as for inserting a needle, and let it be of bronze, smooth in front so that it does not wound the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to place a burning candle, and let there be both large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who use them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of old people, and of thin people from those of fat people.
And one must thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and put it in the cupping glass through the crossbar that is in the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor goes in, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then which is administered in illness of pleurisy, with acute fever, there is no crossbar or hole, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only;
and this is the method:
Leeches are not administered except in limbs where cupping glasses cannot be placed because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nails, and others similar;
and the quality of the leeches is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh water without decay, you take them;
and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then let it be cleansed of blood and cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for that is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the area with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then dry it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it, until the bleeding is stopped;
and if the bleeding is profuse, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you may place on the area halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the area; this will stop it immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood flows, and then apply them, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they are falling off, sprinkle a little alum and salt, or ashes, they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish people cast aside this chapter, because they never saw any of the ancient books, nor read any letter of them;
and for this reason the science is strange in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of the ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and through experiment, and through the habit of my life;
and I have described to you in this chapter what is contained, and have abridged it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary then that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or sprain or bruise comes to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or a child, or an old man; or if the time is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold things, that is to say cold dishes, and the flesh of birds and of kid, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no doubt of a hot abscess, or of the spread of matter to the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that produce great nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and tripe of cow, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the flesh is repaired and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of old and decrepit people cannot be well repaired or healed according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but without cure, reset the broken bone with thick bandages which bind and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not remove it from its work, and for that reason it is necessary to nourish him with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes obliquely, and another by sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes obliquely, and another by sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And each type has its own device and its own instrument for restoration, according to what memory comes to its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and it appears clearly from the outside, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be a twist, or a crack, or a small fracture. Then you must not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then gently restrain it.
And know that for a fracture that goes spirally, and the two parts are separated, they must be immediately set evenly, so that abscesses do not form there;
and if hot abscesses form there, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are subsided;
then set it evenly so that you can move it lightly and wisely, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then restrain it, as is necessary hereafter.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, stretch it from two sides, if it is the hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb according to its natural form, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as much as you can, and ensure that through your work no injury or pain comes to the patient;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
then straighten it nicely, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who through their work cause a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is in place, instruct the patient well that he not move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, nor by turning, nor in any other way; and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is put straight, so that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the qualities of the broken limb are as I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in largeness and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and the like: then it is necessary to wrap it in soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap it with a wide and firm linen, for the wide linen embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it equally on all sides, so that there is no gap;
then bind around it light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little around the whole linen, then go above the fracture and tighten it less, so that the fracture then moves the fracture a little;
and soften the linen little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another linen, and turn it around again over the broken area;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten it moderately, neither too strongly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the linens linen tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind all over it with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and that removes the swelling, and leave it thus for some days;
then apply your splints, and let them be half of a wisely sawn wide cane, or of wood from which clefts are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then apply the splints as you did in the first binding, then tie over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less;
and the threads should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there should be less than the breadth of a finger between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after the tightening in healthy places, then place under them linen lint, or carded wool, so that he is not wounded.
When the wound is accompanied by a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints until after five days or seven, or more, according to your certainty of a hot abscess supervening;
And here is the manner of the ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with plenty of egg, and apply this confection, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring fracture in many situations, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take 3 of bdellium and ladanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and myrrh, of each 10 3; myrrh and aloes, of each 5 3; agrimony 9 3; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; if the man's complexion is warm, he should use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is of use to many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for a sprain: take mugwort and mallow, each 10 3; myrrh and aloes, each 9 3; acacia 6 3; Armenian bole 10 3, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another type of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and the injury caused by the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes the pain.
Another type of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and for diminishing the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, bean flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and apply it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, and flaxseed, balauste, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all these one part each; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its condition.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put anything on a broken limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another kind of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and mix them equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it on.
And then unbind it a little later, and take care if the patient feels no pain, nor has the bone moved from its place; if not, unbind it in several days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and bathe the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is appeased; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it on a nut, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then begin the subtle binding again, and a little plaster, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you need a plaster and a bandage, then begin again, as you did before, equally.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, then do not unbind it before III or IV or V or VII days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture mends, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then bind it tighter than before, and it will thicken its flesh, as I have said before;
and if you see the place drying out more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it; then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time that you unbind it, and let this be every third day, and loosen the binding a little;
by this work then, nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and it quickly mends what foolish physicians do, who bind the limb too tightly:
this is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing else but the letting go and the working correctly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and diverse forms, and the causes are varied;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks the bone all the way down to the spongy bone which is beneath the bone, just as a hatchet or club does; and for that reason this kind of fracture is called "hatchet-fracture".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt impact, or a fissure, or a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is inserted into the bone as finely as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for that reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives a piece of the bone inward, and the place is swollen as caulkers do when they strike on cauldrons; if the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, such as a child's head;
and it happens in all these types of fracture that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is on top.
The hair-like appearance is known by this: that when one has uncovered the bone, and one rubs a probe on it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and convulsions, and fainting, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar symptoms in various combinations, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day if you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the symptoms that we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, then it is necessary that you split the split part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and on the surface of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is needed, and it is that you fill the place with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are assured of the cessation of bleeding; then begin to remove the bone around it, and this is done according to two methods of work:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are made of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary that you pierce it around, before you administer incisions with trephines, not deeply so that it does not pierce beyond the bone of the skull, and it should have a margin or circle above the point, which does not allow the point to pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes in its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have trephines for the whole skull;
and this is the form of the three kinds of trephines:
The qualities for piercing around the fractured bone are that you place a trephine on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the trephine elsewhere a little afterwards, and thus do it all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you remove the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and take care that you do not touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, it is necessary that you scrape away the remaining fragments of bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it should be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen described, which is safer; and he praised it greatly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone where the fracture appears moved, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And do not cut on one side, and the part is sharpened on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane which is underneath;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it lightly, for it is removed well without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and the bone is cut only from above, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to remove that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the nature of the fracture.
Begin first with large rasps, and afterwards with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle fractures, you must apply a remedy according to its condition;
and this is something that is not unknown to one who has studied this art.
And if the syfac is uncovered, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled over two or three times, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the syfac, then apply another linen bandage on top, and do not tighten it too much, only enough to hold the wound;
and leave it like that for one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess is reduced, then untie it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and chickpea flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medicines without biting [ingredients];
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment on it, nor allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the brain's membrane, it corrodes and festers, and great harm befalls the patient;
for when something biting is put on the syfac, it becomes numb on top. Take care then, if any bad accident befalls the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes there only because of the medicine that has been put on, which has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil, and glue one cloth, and put it on the brain; then treat it with the appropriate treatments, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one part only, for they are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and does not break, except to bend or twist, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the hole of the nose, and set the broken part even with your index finger, and with the thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it even with the end of a slightly thick rod.
And if the break is in two parts, do likewise, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then place into the nose tents of linen cloth, if the break is in one part.
Or you place one on the other side, if the break is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a preparation of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient blows through it; or do what you will.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerote or cotton moistened in rose oil, or a little diachylon there.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, apply a plaster externally, of barley flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then apply light tampons, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead cainnes there, until it is healed.
When the jaw is broken underneath, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two, except perhaps splintered inside, this is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently put the fracture in place, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides, until it is even.
And if there is movement of the teeth, or breakage, tie them together with a gold or silver or silk thread, then apply cerate to the broken jaw, and apply a double bandage; and place on the bandage a well-made large compress, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it on as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the alignment changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and apply a plaster, of mill powder with egg white or starch flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; many times it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses appear, administer what we have often said.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of bone is removed; if so, carefully remove it with the instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The splint breaks many times in front, towards the shoulder, and the break is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder where the broken splint is felt; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor shortness.
And if you need to extend further, then place under the patient's shoulder a round sphere of cloth, or of wool, and let it be large according to your need; and extend and lift the splint, and pull the sphere with your hand, so that you set the fracture evenly, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the splint outwards, because it is deeply embedded, then the patient must lie often on his mattress, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and let the assistant push the shoulder downwards, until the bone of the splint is lifted.
And then straighten the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must split it open;
and pull the pieces out gently, and if the bone cannot join because of some impediment, then cut it with one of the scalpels that you have; but that you place this instrument under the splint, to protect the surface:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and should be as wide as is necessary, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the break of the wound that you have made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are certain of a hot abscess, then sew the wound, and if the break is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses occur, soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of the powder from the mill and egg white, and put light tampons on top, and put a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a palm wide, then put a double cloth over the tampons and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the splint on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and bind it from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move on the broken bone, then examine it each day, and when the binding loosens, then tighten it;
and have the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under the armpit while he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will lighten the fracture of the clavicle by the elevation of the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is needed, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is healed;
and it is healed at most in twenty-eight days, and sooner in some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks at the wide place or in the middle, and it is not known except by touch;
then set it according to the shape of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in every way that you can;
then put on the place mill dust with plenty of egg, and light tampons, and put on a double cloth; then put on a broad and fine splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint the hair is uneven in any place of the shoulder, then fill that hair with linen tampons, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the binding each day;
and every time that it loosens, then tighten it, and set the splint straight if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number is complete, then unbind it, and be certain, for it is not a bone that easily moves out of place.
And if a piece of the bone sticks out, and points below the heart, then cut it, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breastbone
The breastbone is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it leans downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and quickly, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hair appears in the broken bone, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and one places a cushion between his shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs of the two ribs with your hands, and subtly put equally in all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and lint over the star subtly of salt, or of other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage roundly to the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it softens, tighten it;
and if it is necessary to untie it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, hasten, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and treat what has come there by means of cures;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only occurs in the thick places behind the back, and towards the front, and they only break because they are slippery; and one feels it well on examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is inward-leaning, the patient feels very great pain, and a stabbing pain, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and soon vomits a large amount of blood, and this is of serious consequence, and the ancients have applied great ingenuity to it.
And there are some who say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, so that hot abscesses do not come if they are not already there. And if they are already there, we heal them.
And some say that one places cupping glasses on the area, to strongly suck, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass does not attract superfluities to the area due to the disposition of weakness.
And some say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in hot oil, and place tents between the ribs to evenly distribute the bandage around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with meat and medicine.
And if the patient feels such great pain that he cannot bear it because of the bone that pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place beneath it an instrument to protect the soft tissue;
and then one must cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area in the meantime as is necessary for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it is necessary, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortal in most instances, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is taken.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are present that are in the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary excretion;
and when he is turned on his belly, there is involuntary excretion. And when he is turned onto his back and wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortal. Then do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the matter is less serious.
And the treatment is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to it until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the cow", if you insert the little finger of your left hand, and set it even with the other hand as best you can, then apply the plaster and the splint on top, if you need it;
then pull it out, and if there are separated bones, then cut above, and remove them, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it only happens with a slight weakening at the head; and it breaks lengthwise, and slopes inwards, and the patient feels pain at the site, and throbbing, and swelling where it breaks.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand upwards, until you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is of its natural form.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it slopes inwards, then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the resetting of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then place a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the sides are even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses appear there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are calmed, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder joint is that which is between the side and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight piece of wood of moderate thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them upwards, and the patient sits on a seat;
then place his broken arm on the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and have a curve of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy thing or the attendant extends it downwards;
then let the physician set the fracture even with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one suspends the patient on his bed, and ties his hand to his neck, then commands two assistants that one hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other hold below with a cord, and each extend at his part.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then pull a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and each of the assistants extend at his part.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must place a cord in the middle below the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then you must put a cord lightly, without effort, until the fracture is even above the place, and above the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and pull it, if hot abscesses do not appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then do not pull it until seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then pull it, and the manner of pulling it is that you place the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and place the cloth, and pull on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone may move, then use splints, and place on the fracture one splint wider and stronger than the others, and let there be one inch of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it extends beyond the fracture three inches on each side;
then pull on the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less outwardly.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the binding, as we have said, at the time that you restore the broken limb, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave it to mature until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the binding, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If so, adjust it, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not unbind it before three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder a cushion filled with wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then adjust it by the virtue of medicine, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is at first subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be completely healed in forty days; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the area.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it should remain unbound for fifty days or two months.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile", of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the wrist;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile is broken alone, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended a little, and set even.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be pulled more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crosswise on himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no pain;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the lower part of his hand, or to a sling, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the doctor set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each in its place, and if there is any separated that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the resetting, hot abscesses arise, then glue a piece of cerate cloth made of rose oil and white wax, which is neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply the plaster of the mill powder with plenty of egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and bind more tightly above the fracture than elsewhere, and always less tightly as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident happens to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must bathe the limb with warm water, until that itching is calmed;
and do not let the limb rest tightly.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bone separated, and similar things, then redress it.
And then take care that nourishment can reach the limb, because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around it, then hang his hands around his neck, and let his neck be straight, and guard against movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the humors.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending happens many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, the patient must sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him evenly;
then he puts his hand on the extended cloth, and the assistant extends the broken bones, and sets them even with his hands, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and the lint, if no abscess forms, then he applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the palm of the hand, make a sling of cloths, and instruct the patient to hold it to his broken palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as is necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place one splint on top, and another underneath on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs in any of the finger bones, if it is the thumb, set it straight as necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and it will not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or bind them all together in an "I" shape, whichever is better, or place a splint on top, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and arrangement of a hot abscess, and treat what comes from it, as I have said.
The thigh bone is often broken, and one sees this clearly when it turns front and back;
and the restoration is that one binds one linen above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his linen to his side equally;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the linens be towards the groin, and the other linen below the fracture.
And likewise if it is near the knee, then let the linen be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone straight with his two hands, until it is according to its natural form, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses form.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The binding is done in this manner.
You must wrap around the fracture a hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to tie firmly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then take the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie with them the three splints that are above, then go back below to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, until neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it happens, then untie it, and treat what appears, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, it is necessary to cut open the area and pull out the splinters; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is little fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts what is broken even with its fingers, as much as it can be assembled;
then apply the plaster, and place a round splint there, if you need one, and bind it as needed, then observe all the conditions that we have mentioned in other fractures, such as a hot abscess and similar things; then apply to each condition what is needed, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "mustelz," and the other is called "foscile";
and the same fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is entirely the same. And if the two bones are broken together, the leg turns in every direction.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it well; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
however, if the fracture is bad, and there are many pieces, the extension must be less and lighter; and ease it according to your skill.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap around it in two places one bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg will not be able to deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, which is of wood, and in it the leg is placed to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, fracture does not occur, but at the bones of the foot, fracture sometimes occurs and at the toes also, and there is nothing but a crack in several ways.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, then have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two full edges, then bind it to the foot properly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether they are broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board that I have mentioned, and bind it properly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be resting on the top of the board above the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each complication as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's hip is broken, make her sit upright, then lean her towards her back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the patient's hip socket with cotton, and put in as much as it will hold;
then stand the woman up, and lift her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump, until it comes to the entrance of the hip, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be healed, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a chain to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the hip; then blow forcefully into the chain until the bladder is inflated inside; in this way the fracture will be reduced;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures near the wrist are not hidden from one who applies himself and his skill, and understands my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right way of restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's gullet and place the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or until it heals, and it will be healed quickly.
Of fracture with wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that he be healed immediately, so that the healings that we have described testify to it.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that very time, or that day, if no hot abscesses appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad consequences.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place lightly with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not sufficient for you to put it in place with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight inches long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs in each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," therefore the curved head should be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even one against the other. And if the fracture is small, and the instrument cannot well grasp the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able;
then scrape what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
Then work until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and cleanly if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer stitches when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the bandaging be softer and gentler than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that a bad accident may occur, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you must not put on stitches; but wrap around, instead of stitches, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrafarmacum ointment and similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continually produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore you must probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces that cause that pain.
And if a fistula develops at the site, or another manner of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what is said in the preceding chapter.
And when the bone is broken, and open on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder, and others similar of the large limbs, do not extract it, for many times death results, but leave it until it rots;
perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many times after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and it is an ugly thing to see the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the wound is fresh: then administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocol, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin again with another, until the inflammation is removed;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation is already converted into hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it away, and remove the apparent excess; or you scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of excessive watering; or because of too much movement, and not at the right time; or because he has little blood in his body, so is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body supple, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment to it, and often sprinkle it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the shape of the limb is ugly, however it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, then they should be bathed in warm water, or softening herbs should be cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and I make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and you mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take ripe figs, and crush them with flaxseed, and similar medicines that reduce swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by continuously and long rubbing with moist hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a thin, light incisor; and put skill and diligence into the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, which prevents it from moving, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reset without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one resets it with difficulty;
therefore one must not move it when it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are calmed;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as its cure comes into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It happens that the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: or they are a little removed from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and the saliva runs from the mouth so that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with his speech.
When the dislocation is slight, it returns by itself in several ways.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a manner that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts the middle finger of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the jaw inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; and the other two fingers of the hand should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the middle finger puts it even, until it returns to its place.
And if bringing it back is difficult, especially if it is both jaws together, then bathe them with warm water and oil, until you soften them slightly;
do not delay in bringing it back, as we have said.
And when they are brought back evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths soaked in cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head should be between two cushions, so that he does not move it neither to the right nor to the left, nor does he strain to chew, but let him take light food, until the pains are removed, and the jaws are healed;
and then let him eat what he wants lightly, and let him not strain to open his mouth when eating and drinking, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be repositioned at once, and are not restored to their place, then fevers and accustomed swelling come, and perhaps diarrhea, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a loss; and many times he who this happens to dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards the ribs and the breast, and is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and hold it tight;
and the shoulder which is towards the side cannot be dislocated; unless perhaps, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it in its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until healed;
and in the same way is the head of the shoulder reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind because of the shoulder, nor does it dislocate inwards because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it jumps out quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps out with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary then that you examine it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lowered towards the armpit, and puts a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly by touch;
and this kind of dislocation is easy to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant lifts the patient's hand upwards, then places his elbows under the armpit, and lifts the joint forcefully upwards into place; and the attendant lifts the hand and extends it upwards, then places it downwards; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and the attendant apply a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then let the patient be laid on his back, and place under the armpit an equal pad of wool, neither too soft nor too hard, then let the physician place his heel on the pad, and lift the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pull the patient's hand;
and another attendant hold the patient's head so that it does not move down; that shoulder returns immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and that you have present a man who is larger than the patient; and let him be straight towards the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pull the patient's hand downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with some heavy thing, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one sticks a long firebrand in the ground, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and should be neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but so that he has soft cloths on top, and the patient stands along the length of the stick;
then his hand is pulled down forcefully on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths on the head of the stick, so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the armpit of the patient;
and extend his arm along the length of the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of suitable width, and let the hands hang down, and let the body hang down on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, however it may be, you must place a smooth ball of wool under the armpit, then apply a plaster prepared with powdered millstone, with incense and egg white, over the whole shoulder and around, then bind it tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to his neck, and let the hands remain so.
And he must eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must administer cautery to three points, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm upwards, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast, and the nipples, or behind, is caused by pushing, and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after the healing comes stiffness in the limb, and slowness in movement, let the patient use a bath many times, until that stiffness is lessened, and returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is broken, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And it is necessary that you reset it before hot abscesses come there, for if hot abscesses came there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reset, especially when it is at the rear; it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration is, when it is such that it can be reset, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms be spread, and the hands of the physician around, above and below, and push the joint with his thumbs together, or at the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm where the dislocation is.
And if it will not return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the physician feels the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then forcefully put the joint back, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the binding, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the binding, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is relieved; or you put on the joint a dressing of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in the bath; and when it sweats, rub the joint moderately, then replace the dressing, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
then it will return to its proper position.
The dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place is swollen, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the resetting is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and you place it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must check if it is well in place; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient places the back of his hand on the table, and the physician places his hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is good. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters, warm poultices, and leave it so without restarting.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after some days, the joint remains twisted;
and it harms the patient nothing except that the hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves or arteries are severed;
there is no other remedy except to restrain it with a cautery near the case, and perhaps nothing else helps.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, soften it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do the same, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions jump out involuntarily, and he cannot hold them, and often some limbs are softened, either the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
that which moves backwards is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you should observe if the gibbosity came from infancy: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from blows or similar things, the ancients described methods of cure with great words, where there is not much profit in all of them;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have devised instruments in various ways.
I say that in gibbosity which comes to the breast in front, there is no device or cure;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which properly comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient should be extended on his face in a level place, and have a cushion beneath him, that he may not be hurt;
then stick one brand in the ground firmly at the head, and another at the feet, and tie one rope across the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two brands;
and they should be well fastened, the brands as we have said, and the physician place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician put his feet on the other end of the board, and press well, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that turns by hand. And it is that you place two brands on the head of the patient a cubit apart, and towards the feet two others, and there should be between each brand, above and below, a palm's breadth of space in length;
and let there be in each brand one hole, where the lathe runs, and let the brands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each two brands let there be one turning brand, on which the straps turn, and let there be on the two turning brands two small brands a palm's length long, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the strap that is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other strap towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with all the strap, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, then put on a drying plaster with abundant egg white, and then the tow, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the place of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy vertebra, then bind it with a strap, as we have said, and let the patient use subtle nourishment, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the last vertebra of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, which is why one should not be presumptuous: by chance it would bring death.
Know that at the hip joints and at the shoulder joints, only dislocations occur, not as in other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated in four ways: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward than elsewhere, and little dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the diseased knee is more open than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes outwardly, is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of that which happens in front, are that he extends his leg well according to its length; nevertheless, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go forward, it cannot, and he retains his urine, and the groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of him to whom it happens behind, are that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and if it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure; and it is not necessary that there be presumption.
And in one whose dislocation is fresh, and this is of the four types of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; perhaps it will return, and needs no other treatment.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and strongly stretch the leg with two hands, or with a linen cloth tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then binds him with a soft linen cloth above the thigh; and another holds the head of the linen;
and they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar [cases], and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then it is necessary to apply treatment similar to it.
When the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that you place the patient on his healthy side, then place the linen on the root of the thigh, and the place which is below the groin, then extend the linen upwards towards the groin, and towards the shoulder;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it strongly outwards; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than others.
And if you cannot set it in this manner that we have described, then it is necessary that you bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft linen above the two heels, and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be hung from the top of a beam, and let it be two arms-lengths above the ground;
then instruct a minister to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another minister hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately quickly.
And when the dislocation is outwards, let the patient lie down, as we have said in the case of one who has gibbosity, and tighten a linen bandage on the affected leg properly, and on the foot as well;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and another at the feet, then place a firebrand between the patient's thighs in the middle of the shape; and have moist cloths placed around, so that it does not burn the patient, then let each minister stretch towards him, and let the physician put the dislocation back in place with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the physician put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it down towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, or lift it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint against the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are even; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are even, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg bend to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient should not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and tense towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and gently place the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is well;
If not, then begin the procedure again, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a rope, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the physician equally set the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and lint, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves that are on the ankle behind, that the bandage not be too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses appear, then you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without effort, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any of the knots of the back of the foot, then you must make the patient sit on a flat place or on a completely straight table, and place your foot on what is visible of these joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing is visible, then place a board with two edges under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not patient and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you do not see hope of healing; and when you see hope, then immediately restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscesses come there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer things soothing to a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is fitting, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and beware of entering into a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this is worth more to you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and your body.
