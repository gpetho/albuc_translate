This airy adra, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron.	On flatulent hernia. I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture.	0.5340904
And the ancients mentioned that it should be made as we described in the adra that is with dalia. And that is to tie the vessels gently below after the incision on it, then incise in the middle.	The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down.	0.64086115
And treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels fall off.	Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away.	0.55933434
And treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.	And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.	0.9233737
