Chapter Twenty-Six:
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and much humidity come to the stomach, causing it to deviate from its usual condition and this leads to a thickening of the tissues, and if you continue the usual treatments without success, then the patient should lie on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize with three cauteries: one below the chest the width of a finger with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of the first cautery, forming a triangular shape; and space them so they are not too close together to avoid causing putrefaction.
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the tendon.
And let the figure of the cautery be in this form without addition. If you prefer, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form; and let this be a circular cautery in this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized with pointed cautery for those afraid of this cautery: mark points on the stomach according to the amount needed, and then cauterize with the pointed cautery; and then treat it with the previously described method until healed.
