So you've filled your children with this book of medical science, which is the last in my understanding before me timewise, and through its explanations, expositions, and declarations I see that you have fully grasped what concerns them within the subject matter we will discuss today about surgery. (Note: The translation above attempts to preserve as much meaning from the original text while converting it into modern English; however, due to ambiguity in medieval texts—especially those written with a mix of Latin and other languages or dialects like Italian or French—multiple translations may be possible.)
The operation is secret within our region and time, wherein I have seen your knowledge of the science; yet only small descriptions in ancient books remain to correct these errors—these are their conclusions and assertions which lengthen my understanding and skill as a practitioner (Note: The translation here attempts to convey that operations related to medicine or surgery were kept secret during certain periods, reflecting on the importance of medical knowledge preserved mainly through texts like those by ancient schols. Here again ambiguity may arise due to archaic language use.)
You have shown me that you bring this book back to life as dictated by the passage of exposition and declaration herein; therefore I am repairing your surgical tools according to these instructions—this is required in order for preparation (Note: Here, it appears a medieval practitioner or teacher discusses rejuvenating knowledge found within texts through detailed study. This phrase further elaborates on the necessity of practical application and understanding.)
May be the reason why no skilled artisan refuses to aid you here, for medicine is an old science and it behooves its practitioner now more than ever in our times; understanding of body parts' functions and their forms within which Guillia knows as much about bones, nerves, and joints—and the union and separation between them. Additionally, they understand muscles (bones), tendons (nerves), ligaments (joints), names of these components, vascgy circulation sites/resting places in their locations; plus blood vessels pulsating with flow, rest spots for it within those structures.
Through the advice of Hippocrates who speaks the truth, it may be done in small measures and mainly through the skill of the hand (artes medicinae).
May we already have informed you of that within the entrance to this free; who do not understand what has been told them about anatomy, will fall into error and die because they lacked seeing much of these things themselves, which are formed in this science and extracted from its knowledge and experiments.
Here is the translation of each line into English:
Here comes another doctor who ordered that the patient drink an herb from which had been processed in his state; this stone was large and came to him via a vessel of water, so that by the third day, that man died.
And you have called it out for removal here because of the greatness of the stone and due to its position in relation with the bladder, wherein they believe that one shall die.

And here comes another doctor who pierced an abscess and it became ulcerated within days, until its evil intelligence was fully revealed to the Lord of that person.
The cause is that the head is chilled by melancholalgy; not all will come to him, but only his suffering member where he has been held captive for so long.
And for this reason, boys, it is necessary that the operation be planned in two parts: one related to health and another where there are significant dangers involved.

And you already have descended this second chapter three times.
Begins the division of the free body; first from the primary partitioned section. The ordered first chapter within the feet, in terms of instruments and metal tools for cauteries, what is needed therein.
The division of the second section. The second chapter on probes and punctures, cauterizations using belladonna (and other plants), extractions of herbs for those purposes, all are ordered according to the forms of these instruments.
The third chapter of restoration and displacement, as well as the healing and management of twists and forms for these matters; ordered within the head encased by bone, and concerning the shapes of instruments.
When you determine the quality of that cauterization and its forbidden complexity,
Therefore say that the discourse of cautery and its obscurity is long and elaborate, requiring subtlety in science; they discuss at length about such things, and are often disagreeing among themselves, which suffices for me as a small part of their speeches.
And thus it is said that the cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two kinds of parts which are tail ends of his matter.
In the complexity of a dry and coarse matter; those who use cautery are beneficial to that part which is affected by it, while others apply contrary methods for that very same purpose wherein water-based healing (cures) are inappropriate due to its quality and aridity. Essentially, the nature of focus on dryness consists both of being coarse and lacking moisture; thus making cautery treatment suitable as it removes excess water while treating such conditions.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
Through that speech of his, I have discovered some truths for myself.
Mays when not covered that which has already been drained and exercised in the capital of cauterization tools for yesterday's practice, we understand the complexity of human composition and the disposition of diseases within them, as well as their causes and accidents; moreover, taking into account the time span of these events.
May occur in other complexities as well; it's not out of fear but mainly due to cold and damp humors, which is why all physicians agree on treating these conditions with cautery therein.
And those who understand the secret of healing by fire and its benevolence towards you will realize that only the focus is simple, as the part to which it was applied cannot harm other members but may slightly affect them incidentally.
May the medicine burn to that in the body which it has touched, and forcefully enter into the diseased member, causing difficult healing and forcing itself out.
May the focus (which refers to a specific point of interest or treatment), due to its sublimity and beneficial nature, does not cause excess unless it exceeds what is necessary. And now we are acquainted with you through experimentation and long study in service at this art concerning truth about causes; therefore, for lengthy discourse (sermo), he/she excuses such duration because during the pause herein afforded to us today'dictated by your generosity, I shall secretly meditate upon my thoughts regarding the focus, demonstrating through our discussion a philosophical argument that would clarify doubts in your mind.
And wise men know that it is best at times in the beginning of summer to perform cauterizations and rest periods.
Even says that cautery is convenient at all times, in order for the harm caused by water retained due to cautery not be submerged into it again and mainly if used for pains or necessary instruments like knives and forceps which do not suffer delay because of fears associated with their treatment; this greater harm entering over time far exceeds small inconvenience.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E aysso non castez in vostre pesci, o filhos, che non stimano ma le popolo vulgare e i foli medici; per questo la cura con cauterie non può essere completata in un solo tempo, ed è necessario riposare il risultato.
E the cause is not due to drinking as they say, but rather it's in a place of medicine that changes complexity and removes the dampness which causes pain.
May therefore, excessive use of instruments in medicine is driven by the patient'dict interest and the grandeur of their lord/master.

The First Chapter.
This cauterization confers moisture and cold upon the accident that is your cause; it arises from sodium and various flows of rheumatic fluid, called urgently from head to limb joints and fingers downward, as well as due to prolonged sleeping, dental pain, gout (joint inflammation), general malaise caused by frigidity, paralysis, apoplexy (stroke), and semblance in these diseases.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the malady to be expelled through medicine-cleansing (as it's called), three or four times, according to how much urges the malady and the patient'thy age and custom.

If the swelling has been present for a long time and it is cured within that period of being solidified.
May I not see all these types of cautery for everything, but only in the wise homes through fear; and this one, I will be better off if you give it to me, as my head is lifted by reason of continuity with our breathing when we have testified among the other members, especially when the head at the groin swells naturally.
And if it is possible that the primary tool for cautery may save and improve more than I, even from this water they are saved by their work towards health.

And with regards to treating or using pointed cautery on the head,
When in the head there is chronic and long-lasting pain due to an extended malady within the belly; doctors use knives and cups and leeches and bloodlettings, as well as various other treatments such as liniments and poultices. Most importantly if already cauterized with a tool that reflects its purpose—that is not further harmful to any part of the body under consideration; moreover when this treatment does nothing more than what was initially done for these causes, then consider it unnecessary: perhaps because there's great calcification in the nature of belly pain itself. And apply pointed cautery to that region over where the vein within their head has been split, as an additional form of treatment if needed when dealing with belly pain due to extensive calcification in its nature; particularly indicating a situation requiring specific attention because there is already existing damage or separation (perhaps Cut the vein and have it discovered within your head to which we refer; this is where you apply another form of cautery in case there'thy a need for additional treatment—a specific location that also serves as an upper chamber (likely referring to blood vessels), here identified by suction cups, indicating not only the site but potentially how and why interventions are focused at these points.

When severe pain in the head occurs during a game (potentially indicating an event like sudden intense discomfort or possibly even seizure), it enters into suffering within the skull—this is where medicine intervenes to relieve pressure and provide other treatments, as mentioned herein; without proper treatment, cauterization in two ways should be considered: either immediate (acute) combustion by medication or using a sharp iron.

The provided text appears to be a complex medical treatise in Latin, possibly from an antiquarian perspective on the cauterization of migraine or other maladies as understood by ancient physicians:
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous jaw movement that makes your mouth drool and ensure that there's no grinding of teeth (bruxism), nor should nervousness occur in those who possess such a condition, so as not to provoke spasms.

When in the finger there is pain due to cold and it's caused by blockages or other causes that have been mentioned previously, and this does not resolve on its own; heat treatments with cautery are used for relief, which I describe here as a puncture form." This line discusses using localized thermal treatment (cauterization) to relieve pain in the finger caused by potential blockages or other underlying conditions. The author explains that this method does not self-resolve and introduces it further with specific details about its delivery, namely through puncturing techniques which allow for direct application of heat at the site requiring attention.
And apply punctures with heat herein and administer it throughout the entire length of the finger joints as if spinning a wheel or circulating in any segments where pain occurs." The author instructs to perform targeted thermal therapy through puncturing, which should cover all sections along the digit'dicto. This technique simulates either rotational motion like that of a spindle (a common instrument used for fine manipulation) or ensures thorough distribution in areas experiencing discomfort as part of comprehensive treatment to alleviate pain caused by cold- Take care with the caulteries of your finger joints, one at a time as you attempt them." Here, the author advises meticulous handling when performing cautery on each individual segment or 'joint' within someone else’s fingers ('am tenta'). This suggests that either they are being instructed by another person (possibly their master)

The text outlines specific measures to prepare or administer this remedy with particular tools, emphasizing moderation ('no comfereys la tua curacio') using three methods: a silver thorn (for extraction/application of the treatment), measured small doses at regular intervals as guided by religious practices ('le sieu templar'), and obtaining essence from kissed lips, which might symbolize purity or sacredness in this context. The mention suggests that rituals played a part even beyond medicinal practice (with

This statement appears to come from a medical context where there may be discussions about alternative approaches due to severe illnesses (maladies) that challenge conventional treatments.

These methods reflect the medieval understanding of medical treatment and their efforts to address ailments where conventional remedies were not effective, particularly for

Here we see a prescription for treating itchy scalp conditions using poultices and specific applications meant to soothe discomfort through methods that likely involved topical application of substances believed by practitioners at the time to have curative properties on skin compla If the malady (illness) is strong and enduring, then you will cauterize those parts which I have described, causing a numb paralysis on the backbone of the chest and lower backbone.

Some causes of pain in both legs are due to bruising or injury (from impact), constipation, and reasons akin to these conditions; they can be addressed through the application of moist warm substances that have penetrating qualities. This suggests an approach from medieval medicine where balancing bodily humors with specific treatments was common practice for alleviating pain associated with various causes like trauma or digestive issues, indicative of a time when medical understanding and interventions were more based on theory than modern science.
Cautery is not used for anything else but this very specific quality that it causes through effusion of the humoral substance.
So then, remove the suppuration and resemblance of their thighs and chests which are pains above three lines according to his condition; place fingers or cauteries in each line as much as he tolerates from this discharge and vitality.

Regarding the cautery of gout and joint pain, it appears that this line suggests a medical intervention for these conditions using heat or some form of thermal treatment as part of medieval
When joint pain is caused by cold (humoral) humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when this type of pain occurs in the feet ("pes"), it has become customary for doctors to call such a condition gouty arthritis. Here they refer specifically to "dolor de juncturas," which aligns with medieval notions that sickness can be attributed to an imbalance or misdirection of bodily fluids, known as humors in ancient and early modern medicine theory ("fregas les quals so enfundutz").
And when gout (cause of joint pain) is treated and not recurred due to the curative care provided by doctors, then such purgatives remove the pains without failures.
When you are cauterizing that which is eliminated in the circulatory channel of the joint between the foot and the ankle with cautery, it means:
That is the form of this tool:
If it is necessary for a point to be made on the surface of the foot, then use pointed cautery accordingly. If the pains penetrate into the abdomen or other joints, and their motions worsen it, then you should perform cautery on any affected joint with three to four of these same instruments used for this purpose at that time.
If you have enough lancets for these lancets and they are necessary for them, then apply the one needed without pressing too hard with your hand on the lance beforehand; use only as much force required to insert into the thigh area.
If pain enters into both shoulders at once, then apply the caustic that we have mentioned in this chapter.
If the pain is only in the limbs alone, it calls for sweating therapy; and a needle will be inserted along the circuits of the meridians as they turn within these two lines.

The phrase "cauterize wounds" refers to the use of heat (commonly a heated iron or similar
When wounds occur in the joints, and you apply cautery directly to the tendon attached at that point (presumably during a healing procedure), it is understood by some doctors as applying pressure with their hand above this area so that swelling does not extend into the stomach. It's further explained here:
And follow the patient' extrication between their thighs on top of your two, and command that they hold onto their private part to ensure no hernia or prolapse occurs from them (meaning: "no atrophia" in Latin).

The use of caustic agents for the treatment of leprosy sometimes requires a strong application to act effectively; whereas, when it is caused by decay and melancholy (a possible reference to humoral theory where imbalances lead to disease), only a gentle touch should be applied.
And when you intend to cauterize that one, consider if the leprosy is present and has been treated with the waters we have discussed in section (and not thereafter), nor this, nor fear that corruption may affect the entire body of yours, then cauterize it on the head using a heated lancet: once at the top of your head, twice for each part underneze below; and both over two calluses; and one behind, upon the nape or servant.

The provided text seems to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
Regarding the treatment of fingers and similar body parts (assuming 'semblants' refers to other joint or limb-like structures). The text discusses various
Regarding the treatment of malformed or diseased parts at the end (fingers) and sides (assuming 'dejos' refers to extremities such as hands or feet), which causes a downward shift, these are treated with cauterization in two ways: one on focus [likely meant here is "area" referring back contextually] – for example where there might be inflammation at the base of an affected limb (this interpretation assumes 'foc' relates to some sort of localized area needing treatment, perhaps due to swelling or infection), and another on water tail [possibly a metaphorical reference; if literal it would mean "water cure," which is not applicable here], implying external application for healing.
Cauterization on focus is required because if the cautery'dictions are not precise (likely referring back here to methods of treatment), it could lead to further injury—a situation as dire as being burned by a sharp instrument, which would be considered very severe damage. Such instruments must have fine and delicate margins containing all parts necessary for comprehensive part-healing ('clau' or key factor in repair). The implication is that the tools used should not only remove damaged tissue but also promote healing with precision to prevent additional harm, consistent with medieval medical practice where cauterization was a common treatment method aimed
Pause the fire (cauterization) over that key area and place your hand to guide the tools of healing within this loop ('circuit' implying an enclosed space where treatment occurs), ensuring that these instruments penetrate deeply into the cavity formed by the cauterized parts. This suggests a controlled methodology, using direct physical contact with precision (hand guidance) and deep intervention for effective curing of damaged areas within limbs or joints during medieval times when such techniques were used in medical practice to prevent further injury through careful application The given text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that seems influenced by Latin and various Romance languages like Italian, Spanish, French due to its vocabulthy and structure.

And wait for just a few minutes until the pressure of the wet vial needles is relieved by the bites of your hand; after that you remove those still-residual drops with gentle touch from where they have been embedded in the clamp, and this will rectify any remaining issues if there were errors made earlier.

Of the treatment for what causes pain in the fingers.
Throughout the cause of pain in the fingers is one of four species; it may be metal or resembling stone, like iron and glass, or fluid-like substances such as water and wine grains, possibly due to some animal'dict:
And when blood comes out of the ear or seems similar to those causes that do not align with it and stops flowing from the ear into some place where oil is violently spilled or syrups are mixed, then one administers its extraction, performs cauterization according to conditions, applies amputation if necessary, bandages wounds after they have healed. Return the pause in the artery'dictor circuit some wool or linen pads, and extend the artery to the parts above it continuously; this is necessary due to these causes.
If it is not expelled internally, then administer external removal using the gentle instruments referred to here as such methods.
If there is a blockage (foreclosure), it happens quickly; otherwise, the doctor administerse gentle and repeated drainage using only a few small cups or tools.
So if there is no exit for the humoral discharge, then place an arsenic tube and insert its extremity into the track of the aureola; seal it at both ends with wax and oiled linseed oil so that only the tube protrudes.

When there is disruption in the tunica uvea (the vascsular layer of a structure such as an eye), and you raise it up above its usual position like raising your finger with one hand, allowing air to enter into that space—this action involves two instruments: placing one instrument underneath where part has been removed ("in the portion below"), securing another similar tool in place (possibly a doubled needle related to tear fluid), and then inserting it following its initial arrangement; simultaneously hold up this second tool at which point some section of the uvea shifts into motion within that instrument's circuit.
When you extract and place pressure on the clot above, immersed in wine alcohol and egg yolk, allowing it to flow inside where there is blood (possibly referring to a poultice or treatment involving these substances).

May the reason for your action be to spread the wound over the board and dress it with cloth from both of your arms' lower parts, placing them where you see disease entering at intervals after birth, securing dryness without letting moisture descend further or being wet by blood; thus causing venesection (bloodletting) in accordance to old practice.
If it does not come down into urine, understand that there is water inside.
If the descent to health has not been prepared as we have discussed, then gout will seep between your thighs and press down delicately with a soft sponge undernethy chest where cornea (outer layer of eye) is present in the crown portion (head/forehead area), until the sickness comes out.

If the patient is frightened by his ignorance and uses fear in cauterization (which he must do), then it's only a sharp water used for this, not actual medicine. You should hold the top of their thigh with your hand to prevent swelling at that spot; also place your other hand under them or on their chest holding hands as we have mentioned here before:

Alternatively, take pebbles (from clam shells) made soft with sea sponges that have absorbed brine; hold these firm and remove the putrid matter therewith within its chambthy membrane—as soon as you extricate any thorns or embedded irritants from this locale where they reside, your symptoms will promptly abate. (This translation considers medieval medical practices of addressing foot pain potentially linked to systemic infection such as dysentery caused by spoiled food) and outlines a procedure for using natural materials found on the beach ("pessa de nap" or clam shells, "de razit la laytuga," which may refer to plant-derived linens used historically) along with sea sponges ('sequa leon') that have absorbed brine (seawater), suggesting a natural remedy for purifying the patient and removing infectious agents from within. May take a snake and bind it with fidelity (loyalty or trust), and insert the needle on both sides of its body, either using a sponge to extract fluid from inside when necessary; alternatively, use a pore and also suction out what is needed.
If it is not about these causes that have been mentioned, then use a tool made of lead according to this form.
And if it is a large abscess that appears small within its cavity, which you insert into the patient's ulcer for ease of treatment.
And lift the patient'thy head upwards and ensure that you do not touch their throat or backbone; this is what the doctor holds for them.
Even if the patient'dict causes him to advance further into it (the illness), due to its local knowledge of the cause and because he induces his pain, taking out his tool accordingly based on how much is prepared inside that entrance which has been made ready for removal ("foro-getada").
Given that "Capitol" does not provide any text for translation within
The phrase you've provided, "De extraccio de sancguisugua annexsa al golayro," appears to be in a Latin-based medieval language, which may
When bloodletting is applied in the division of healing and does not worsen you, consider that it should be done on the gallbladde or bile duct within the liver, wherein thou hast been recommended an instrument for this purpose which belongs to thee.
So if you again find bleeding, extract that small or subtle discharge carefully.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave canula and insert that into the area of the malady, placing a heated iron at the bottom of the canule' extrusion (making sure that the sausage-shaped humoral entity remains within the region), thereby preventing its escape throughout the day.
Here comes the translation line by line:
If there is no treatment-given water that we have recommended, then apply moisture to the thigh or on arsenic powder with the same tool used in humidifying the uvula.
When cold humors invade each part of the body (quando fredi umori invadono ogni parte del
Another peculiar aspect of operation in the context provided appears to be: When you hold an oily substance (carbon ignites within it) covered by a layer and placed inside that gap, positioning the extremity of the instrument below sublimation; pause beneath warming, placing your mouth on the tip of the canula (a small tube), sealing your lips to ensure that there is no rupturing during inhalation until you realize that sublimation has reached the area needing treatment.
If not yet done so, then repeat the subfumigation movements, and prevent the humors in the malefactor from drinking, eat salted and acidic foods, and do not drink water; as it is necessary that this treatment be followed strictly.
This is the form of the tool with which one extracts stones from the gallbladder when seen; it resembles pincers used sometimes, but without any curvature herein.

The sentence appears to be a blend of medical terminology and possibly Latin or Romance language structures:
Here are the translations line by line:
The second manifestation is in the places where acids are located, which when entering the head occurs elsewhere than at the back or abdomen (where an abscess forms), and pus accumulation that happens on solid tissue differs from joint inflammation; each of them requires operative intervention.
May some of which covers not be pierced but are properly indicative signs of illness in those places, and hence should remain intact for observation therein.
So other implants that are dislocated when crossed and do not mature according to their place of origin—similar to those at joints themselves; such an implant becomes a cause for contraction of the affected limb, or if it is related to the main organ (most likely referring to the appendix), then its perforation occurs within this already diseased state. If you perform puncture on something that has not matured yet in relation to the primary abdominal area—this leads to indigestion rather than resolving, for it is where digestion takes place; and what was pierced becomes elongated at the divisions of the intestines associated with this location. If puncture occurs outside its proper time or site (i.e., not in a diseased state), then there will be no indigestion as complication, but instead it can cause fistula formation and ulcers that do not heal within the body of mankind. May you know the time of the puncture for the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
You understand that it matures when the pain subsides and fever ceases, and you should observe the decrease in speechlessness (silent or sluggish breathing) and pulse rate, as well as the strengthening of the head at the site of suppuration, and other signs.
When you know where the incision made for drainage is located, immediately after starting to remove pus and used in treating inflammation of bumps (abscesses), do so quickly at these spots.
Perforation shall be done through the length of the flesh or body, if spicules are in the parts of muscles or feet, and at sites where no reflection occurs (in joints, nerve sheaths, ligaments), then perforate according to that part.
When the abscess is in a muscle location, then we let it pierce through until its digestion has been confirmed twice more as before; but if you perforate that area now, it will extend the leg of the patient and make their lips hardened and deepen.
May an apothecary insert a catheter according to the body'dictate or as needed by that member of the body which desires it.
When you administer a small incision, and large or wide incisions according to the variety of the sizes of the instruments used for it.
Other than the apendices where the cecum is constricted and inflamed, when it hurts with hunger pangs or throbbing similar to those caused by blisters and boils, at that moment also suffers such as this one who experiences acidity in doses of dullness.
From those who are seated with three joints; and from those in which it is ensconced like the branches of a myrtle tree or as the appendages of angles:
When they are in those places where it is administered as a round and crescent shape, resembling them.
May those who cannot stand with their surface pinworms should not be pierced only that which has been punctured on the surface, or as flatly done for now.
And when the abscess is large and has collected pus, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; take out some from that part, restore what was taken inside another day, remove a larger portion on yet another day, applying warm applications as per gradual improvement until fully healed.
Mostly if the malady is due to excessive phlegm or a pregnant woman/infant in infancy/elderly person, for their breath moves and leaves them ill; then it comes out through disease exhalation, and they soon die from this sickness. Here, doctors operate on these patients (likely referring to the removal of excess phlegm or management during pregnancy).
Guard your work with great care and place the tip of your incision tool in it through which you pierce these thorns; be sure to avoid diseases, then consider if the pus from the thorn is scanty or a flat layer—administer accordingly what was prescribed for him/her by elders, and if the thorn is large and there are cracks in your incision tool's tip, cover it with plaster at any point inside where we might arrive.
If in the abscess it has detached a part of the colon or you have made that area concave within its circuit, then cover it with fine cloth soaked in water (or filtred liquid), apply when adding pans and plasters, maintain moisture; keep this inside for three days to cure what comes out from the bandages.
If during your operation you experience bleeding of the sancus (blood), then administer cold water and let it flow through these channels where bandages are applied; place something there to stop this bloodflow from time spent on operations.
If the flow of bile persists, then take care that you follow your regimen and medicines as recommended here in our book and division.
If it is winter time and the location of the ulceration is where muscle nerves are located, then cover them with powder made from vine leaves and oil cauterously (with a heated instrument), stopping these over their respective locations.
If it is summer and the locations are carnivorous, then when you pause pulpils at the beginning in water and oil as we have said before today, do so until tomorrow; also cover up any abscess or pus that has entered into your body to aid in its healing according to what was previously discussed.
So it is that the knowledge of universal cautery treatment becomes necessary at any time, even according to the method I have described for treating each type of apendicitis individually.

When the parasites enter into the chest (thoracic region), it refers to a condition where these organisms, possibly worms or other types of helminth
When worm parasites enter the chest (thoracic region), they are encased in their own protective covering, which contains nodes; these structures act as organs for them within this casing - likely referring to how helminths live and reproduce inside a host. The mention of "nodes" suggests that parasites might be schistosomes or similar organisms with complex lifecycles involving snail hosts, where
They are laid eggs (ova), and those that contain moisture similar to sea-water - indicating the reproduction phase of schistosomes or other waterborne helminths, which require specific aquatic environments for their lifecycle completion including hatching And those that contain moisture similar to pepper (possibly referring to the texture of infected urine), and their assemblage - likely indicating how eggs accumulate in tissues or are deposited outside the body; while others are stone-like/hard, suggesting mature larval forms called cercariae which seek a suitable environment for further development.

This is the text of those sayings.
May sometimes lack in men who avoid the extraction of blood, such that for water it is not well extracted from all veins and major arteries within their body.
In those who have had caustic substances inserted into the mouth or with two hooks when the illness is not in the throat, it must be urgency to remove the piece that causes pain due to cold extraction (seek immediate removal of the irritating object causing severe chilling-induced pain).
So when we want to collect the fluid (presumably referring to pus or other effluvia), insert the sponge slowly in three circles within each circle of the abscess, or four small sections for circulation between those two circles so that a section is inside and not on cartilage; this location is appropriate as it excludes flesh and veins from being squeezed.
If the doctor is afraid, then extend one end of the gout-fist am once and open the fist until it reaches the channel; this may prevent bleeding from any cause related to that area.

Through this command, let the entrapped creature within be consumed over three days due to the cunning of the illness; and henceforthy we order it so that the entity is digested while healing inside him for health recovery.
And when you have seen through me the patient's chest and placed a cushion on their thorax (their "gola"), placing thereon part of the lungs ('canada'), calling it care for them, while holding onto their mouth as they moan from illness, uncovering pus within ("plagaya") and then treating said pus with what was found inside it—small remnants.
So it was admitted that she had not inscribed a vein or artery, and the wind has entered her body through the play of insects; therefore, treated until the focus is healed.

This typical blister-like swelling (apostema) is caused by heat and it occurs primarily in the legs of women ("mot" here implies a cause). Here they attribute this condition specifically to gender and possibly related physiological or climatic reasons, considering that these factors might influence skin sensitivity. This highlights how medieval medicine often

And in nature, there isn’thy remedy for this situation (implying that within normal bodily processes and environmental interactions without
And in nature there isn't an effective remedy for this situation (suggesting that without medical intervention). The first supposed cause is akin to nodes of grass or perhaps some kind of vascular condition associated with small vessels ("nodacio de arteria"), which causes fear. This statement reflects the understanding and belief in medieval medicine about pathology's origins, often attributing symptoms like swelling (possibly related to inflammation) to natural occurrences within bodily systems or external environmental factors that were beyond their control at times – a combination of structural ("nodes") and circulatory issues.

The operation in him/her is considered if the prominency of his/her navel (the umbilicus) is because of sanction, or veins, or wind; observe that you must not perform treatments on him/her as instructed here, out of fear and concern. This indicates a need for caution based upon specific teachings given in the capital where signs were discussed concerning arsenic-related issues (arsenia) and venous problems, emphasizing restraint due to potential risks or harm associated with certain medical interventions.
If the prominency of his/her navel is because of an intestinal protrusion (hernia) or sling, then you must command the patient to retain control over it and keep it extended; furthermore, apply a password for attempting in all parts of the umbilicus—and position yourself between your legs with one hand on top of each other above his/her navel. Then surround this area within its circuit using a spinal stick or lay down as directed during trial attempts at restraint: and extend towards those greater than usual divisions (parts) to maintain control, while the password remains in place inside it; also ensure that the belt stays firmly around his/her waist. This passage outlines specific techniques for handling hernias associated with umbilical prominence during medieval times, highlighting how restraint and correction devices like spinal sticks or a heavy leather girdle were to be applied while keeping certain boundaries in mind regarding the manipulation of body parts affected by such conditions.

If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where it pierces the extended flesh, inscribing that which enters when pushed in; mark those places where entry occurs, and apply care there for what comes out of the woolen garments inside as heals.

The process of refining the children and caring for those who have been circumcised in them.
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity with other diseases: however, if it belongs to our operation and from our willfulness, and because of that which comes naturally in children, we must assign them the better healing way through less painful puncture.
Therefore, it is said that ancient people did not practice circumcision among free individuals at their leisure time and only used them when they acquired new tools for experimentation. This causes the majority of craftsmen and barbers to resort to using a new razor or straight razor; they use hairpin made from steel wire as well, holding onto it with their nails.
E you have already employed all these methods and cannot do any better with words or thread that in embroidery, some threads escape from under the fabric piece below, others around the penile area between two tunics, tightening the thonged cushion of flesh here quickly.

In surgery with an unguent (ointment), if you rush and cause damage, it will ruin your operation. The child'thy bellybutton is naturally small and tends to get dirty easily in such a way that there was no need for cleaning it out, which has been observed by him (the doctor).
May the mending process that I've done with thread and nails for strength involves proportional measurements of these materials; hence when you determine your two thicknesses accordingly as guided by measurement comparison in a specific timeframe, it results in compression of the finger according to its figure contained within the entirety of this instrument (likely referring to bandages or splints), without any error whatsose.

For the given Latin-like text regarding bladder retention and its treatment, here's a translated version:
Retain urine in the bladder is considered a disorder caused by excess phlegm or pus due to stone formation or inflammation, and it seems similar to those described by doctors as cure-related divisions.
If it is not dissolved by the water we have mentioned so vehemently as the cause upon the abdomen, then cover its extraction with a tool of this form: It may be made of silver and subtle lion conqueror; small in size like a slender staff or wand used for gentle suction (a type of catheter), which is thin at one end resembling both palm and thumb.

When the quality of enema and instruments used are appropriate, they correspond to this purpose (or situation). Here "enema" refers to a medical procedure involving introduction of liquid substances into the rectum through the anus, often for therapeutic reasons such as cleansing or medication delivery. The phrase is emphasizing that effectiveness and appropriateness
When an ulcer or abscess appears in the bladder (vesica) or at that location where there is coarseness and/dictate puncture has occurred, it becomes necessary to distill waters and medicines into that place. Here "bladder" refers specifically to a body organ called vesica, which stores urine before excretion through the urethra (the passage from bladder for expelling liquid waste). The procedure mentioned is one where specific tools or instruments are employed – possibly endoscopes and other medical devices used in cystolithotomy ("clamp-bladder surgery") to remove stones, treat urinary tract obstructions like strictures (narrowing of the urethra due to scar tissue), abscesses or
But if in that exterior part there is hearing silence and a closure has occurred – it implies an obstruction within the urinary tract outside of the bladder (perhaps indicative of stones lodged at And in that location, there are three disruptions: two from one party and once for the other (likely indicating multiple urinary stones with different origins). Here "traumas" or “disruptions” could refer to kidney stones causing
In the place where it is collected (likely referring to a body of water or fluid in some medical context), that's what gets called into action – and its quantity depends on how much there is, which once drawn back becomes subjected again by drawing out whatever caused this mobilization. Here "drawing" suggests removing material from the place it has been collected (potentially urine samples). After extraction ("expelled"), if long enough, naphtha ('naphta' in medieval Latin influence) is used during naval battles as a weapon or repellent – metaphorically suggesting that similar agents might be employed post-extraction for treatment. The context likely involves urological procedures where urine samples (collections of 'fluid') are drawn from the body, examined ('expelled'), and treated with certain chemicals like naphtha if they were used in any way to aid medical processes during medieval times or as a misinterpretation based on mixing metaphors. In modern understanding this makes little sense – urine is not stored for naval battles nor handled chemically beyond
So when you want to prevent moisture in the bladder, insert the extremity of crab'endo into the moisture, and draw out that water which is pushing against the cavities above it; thus removing the moisture therein.

The form under which the bladder is constricted, and that shape is as follows:
And it is either of silver or side quality, and I have placed the head on it like a small feather, then quickly bind tightly with ligature.
Return the bladder to its position, and hold there until moisture accumulants in the bladder can be scalded at the focus (source of heat).
Return (or reposition) the limb of the patient in its cavity, and place your hand over it so that the limb does not protrude outwards into the wound area
Then place your hand over the bladder to prevent urine leakage due to pressure within the wound area that has reached this point of vulnerability, as the moisture (humidity) continues its spread downwards into the bladder through where it entered internally. This instruction likely relates to managing a situation in which an injury or surgical site may compromise the integrity of surrounding structures such as skin and possibly organs like the bladder, thereby necessitating careful handling by
Then if there is no bladder present, take a wool pad and make it into a circle; pierce that entire circumference with an instrument (likely indicating the use of needles or similar tools); carefully reposition your fingers within those disruthy areas until you resolve their movements. Moreover, as long as urine accumulates in there—pausing only when necessary to address these fluid buildups—place a circle around this area similarly but with cloth (presumably for the same purpose), allowing any remaining water or fluids within that space while intermittently pausing and managing it. This elaboration suggests an ancient medical practice, potentially focusing on wound care where bladder control is compromised due to injury; herein lies a method of prevention against urine leakage involving the use of absorbent materials (wool) alongside careful manual technique for affected individuals who may have sustained damage leading to such complications.
Then take that circle with your hand and apply it to the area as fluids approach or enter into (the bladder). This indicates an immediate response technique wherein, once created using wool—as previously described for managing urine leakage—you can use this makeshift barrier in conjunction with direct manual pressure provided by your hand. The intention is to block the pathway of fluids reaching or entering into (the bladder), likely as part of a broader strategy aimed at preventing complications associated

(This translation attempts to convey that practitioners categorize stones based on their origin—whether they come from hillside erosion or are produced internally, possibly referring to kidney-related conditions. "Specias" here likely refers not just as species in the biological sense but categories of stone for medical purposes.)

And there he reports that such an exhibition has been made and abbreviated.
So it is said that stones are formed in the bladder mainly during infancy; and from his sinews they appear as water vapor due to their subtlety, appearing therein (within); gout attacks his urethra, causing intermittent pains, and dressing occurs at this time.

When applied directly over that area between his thigh bones in this region of pain, Return that outwardly (or) remove it externally. Return those parts for which they are fastened and cleanse the sanctified cords that have become dirty in dust; this is what you do on the ground floor (likely referring to when one returns home or back to their quarters).

From the stone of women's bodies.
Pebbles are scarcely formed in women'thy thighs.
May it be found at any of those places, making the cure difficult and forbidden for overzealous hands.
The one of them is a strong woman with veins visible.
And if you do not find a woman skilled enough to extract the stone when it is thrown out by the physician or from among women who have had stones, then what shall one do?
The clear woman here knows this art, mainly in surgery.
The location of the section over the breastbone in women is longer than that on the chest area; therefore, there arises a fear of invasion by sections beforehand.
If it is necessary to bring up water for you, then take hold of one woman servant who knows how and apply light pressure; do not overdo it.
May if you lack it, seek a skilled midwife who has been trained in the care of women or a woman present at this stage in their birth process.
Therefore take that present with you and command him/her to hold all the water you have given them until the examination of the back is complete; this causes concern because if the woman is pregnant, she should not lie on her belly but rather place herself at the foot of the bed (or lean against a pillow), indicating that they wish for childbirth.
So if you crush that, command it to insert into that very place immediately.
May it not be a wound; if so, the matron commands that her duty is to insert and position within the cavity of the sickness and place pause on their left side above the bladder area, apply what good concoction she has prepared.
So if you suffer it, have the one who gradually worsens that of the bladder to their joints come into mind whereby they can reach at once within which part is affected by urgency due to excess in the body' extraneous humoral fluid.
Place oneself submerged in that position where the thigh of each leg is at rest and centered under it; this does not disturb the articulation joint from its connection with the pelvic bone.

Therefore you understand how much spices are needed for what you intend on using them for.

Section on herniation, also known as an "erection" in medical terms referring typically to the pro
A hernia is not simply an accumulation of moisture within the white circle that lies behind the coda (tail) of the intestines contained in what are referred to as 'guts', and it's called a "circle." In traditional medicine language, this suggests understanding how body fluids might contribute to conditions like hernias. Here we can see an attempt at connecting medieval medical theories with observations that indicate fluid imbalance or leakage could lead to physical manifestations such as the
And in some cases it is within the parenchyma (the functional tissue of an organ) that nature itself forms therein where another humidity already exists; and this lies between the coda behind which we discussed earlier—and note, they are not stones but rather natural formations made by body fluids themselves. Here again in medieval medical parlance is a recognition of how bodily processes can generate conditions such as hernias through fluid dynamics within tissues that may be closely linked to organ function and spatial anatomy – specifically the area behind what was earlier described, which should not contain stones but natural accumulations formed by body fluids. The description stresses on understanding internal changes brought about naturally in

And when it comes to the joints for which this addition of water is meant: if we have mentioned here the white cistern that we have spoken about before, then rheumatism (gout or arthritis) subsides gradually during a long bath with its shape resembling hound'lausers, and the humidity takes it away from all parts.
If moisture is present in the patient's pancreas, then an abscess forms there and thus he estimates another issue (within himself).
If there is fluid between the base of the urethra and/dictum blanche (which could refer to a bladder or similar anatomical structure), apply pressure with your fingers immediately.
When you wish to learn about the color of humidity, look at the exudation in which its form is preceded; and as soon as it enters into the trace whereby one becomes infected, examine the color thereof immediately present.
So when we come to treat him with iron, then if it is possible for you to consume the black bile that he has, do so and sometimes apply his flesh on himself.

From healing a hernia, it comes from the womb (or perhaps indicates that care begins at birth or originates within). The sentence
The essence is encapsulated in an application that resembles a soft wrap around the testicles to alleviate them and make it difficult for exercise or walking over the hernia, possibly indicating some sort of treatment meant to manage discomfort associated with this condition during movement. The sentence suggests using something like a compressive garment made from mollifiable materials (softer that can be easily worn) designed specifically around testicles—this could refer either literally as a form of tight underwear or more metapthyically

Therefore it's said that you should spread the hernia over an elevated cushion (potentially suggesting to position oneself in a way where pressure on the affected area is reduced); and align your testicle suspensors at various joint locations; as well as cover those other pieces assigned, placing them underneath accordingly. It then instructs you furthermore that not only should these items be moved vigorously (possibly referring to exercises or movements meant for recovery), but also extend tendons of the genitals into depressions below knee bows—which could imply a physical therapy technique focused on promoting blood flow and healing. The phrase "extenda am les tieus ditz" is somewhat unclear, as it may involve specific anatomical structures (tieux) not commonly referenced in modern medical terminology; this part of the sentence suggests that movement or extension should be forceful for therapeutic purposes—it

On the first days said that it felt as if we had recommended in treating this hernia which was there; and so you should place ligatures on its surface above where liquid has accumulated due to action of our work, ensuring they are dry at the site before inserting them. This translation attempts to convey a description from an old medical practice regarding how one might treat a hydrocele – implying that initial days or observations were made about handling and potentially surgical intervention for hernias with fluid accumulation in some manner using ligatures, following which they need drying at the site of application.
And when it is time for care as we have discussed, then that shall be healed.

Some movements may break the intestines while having them (implying a situation where one might be dealing with an obstruction or disruption within the digestive tract), and they seek out that location likely referring to symptoms such as pain in certain areas of concern, which could indicate inflammation or another issue
And none of the gastroenterologists (genetici refers to "gastroenterologist", a doctor who specializes in conditions affecting the digestive system) have any cause within themselves for these issues; and if they do, it is very rare – returns there at all times. This implies that such professionals rarely suffer from intestinal problems like hernias or constipation themselves, but when this does occur, it's not commonplace
And if the time is prolonged (likely referring to an enduring or long-lasting episode), there must be care taken within that chest cavity where they keep this object – and when pressure inside it extends, which can happen due to inflammation of that space being present in their intestines as well; thus softening the site from where it was extracted (this suggests medical intervention may include drainage or decompression). The mention here underscs a cautious approach required for such situations involving prolonged internal pressure, emphasizing attention to potential complications like inflammation leading up to procedures aiming at relief and restoration.

When you apply pressure on the two prominent areas above the spine' tailbone and adjust with one of these atop another (likely referring to positioning or bandaging techniques), do this for treatment purposes, potentially aimed at relieving pain or addressing a specific health concern related to that area.
Apply pressure to the spine's extremity without touching or compressing entirely all of its parts and do not extend beyond this area unnecessarily, as it is for treating an inguinal (abdominal wall) hernia; these actions should guide your intervention in care. This translation interprets "extratz" to mean applying external pressure outside the spine—a common medieval technique possibly aimed at correcting or alleviating a physical condition, and here it is applied specifically with respect to inguinal hernias
Care for that which pertains to healing diseases and, as you inspect the fields (potentially referring here metaphorically or literally), purify this area and restore what has been broken within; when it comes to a hernia of spine tissue where contraction occurs but there is no elevation in prominence at rupture site—focus your care on these aspects.

This line suggests a treatment approach where gentle movements or manipulations applied to specific areas around the spermatic cord can alleviate discomfort.

This line translates to indicating a medical practitioner's role (likely a barber or surgeon skilled at surgical procedures) responsible for ensuring proper care of patients undergoing treatment related to the male reproductive system, particularly focusing on managing water influx that could be associated with conditions like hydrocele. The reference here involves adjusting one's lips (possibly referring to mouth-to-body contact or direct palpation) during such procedures as part of patient care and monitoring.

These penetrations are troublesome for the reason that they cause exacsion and discharge (excretion); some of them even have an outlet or opening through which efflux occurs, leading to other patients' contamination; others use this same pathway as their exit site.

From the humors of the colon (or from the disorders or imbalances in the li
When the soil becomes acidic in the colon (or when there is a difference or imbalance), it makes no distinction between the sickness of the belly and that of the head; both are simple to treat medically.
May you inscribe or arterialize the nerve of the colon if it is a nerve, not in its current location but to prevent treatment with water that causes violent spasms, similar to vinegar and semblance for their eyes, which they do not look at as such. No joint does not stop from any cause of madness; the substance of nerves is also feverish and continuous flow within it, which causes all limbs to be filled with it.
If the healer is interested in using folk remedies for treatment, then when washing with water (or possibly non-rosinated oil), apply some herbal decoction or infused olive oil as directed by this methodology; heat and stones used during bathing along with liniment.
If the patient is large, administer stitches or trim their lips, and take care that they are cleaned until healed.
If there is depth or pain in the lower parts of the body, it may be due to gout as well (in that location), then pierce through where necessary with a trephining instrument used by doctors for such procedures.
If in the patient there is an embedded artery and blood flow has been obtained from it, then separate or dry out that one, or apply cautery to it if necessary; this will prevent fluid accumulation (or effusion).
May you have secured the vertebrae of the spine or all, and thus protected the veins in the neck; do not touch that area with your lips on its ridge above where it meets the backbone, but adjust them over their natural curve, strengthening this part through structure alignment. Leave it for a few days until healing occurs within those sutures or fractures – and ensure appropriate care to prevent any movement inside which has caused injury from worsening.
May if the child already has pain in the bone, then I will strike that place; and if there are fragments of bone present, take all those you can from them; but if it is not possible for you to enter inside, let water be introduced so that the child's flesh may swell up (and come out), and its entrails shall also be separated and removed.
If the patient is young lately, then grind over that powder which has been recommended for you. If there is an opening (fistula) in the child, then treat that with water from which they will remember to come back to their head.
If it is a lance or cottage wound and at times the depth of such an injury, you must consider that sometimes wind from the foulness affects when the wounds are open (bleeding), for then knows well that the patient is dying (their condition).
If there is no depth in the patient and their wound has recently healed, then you pause in that first hour after ointment application, without stretching so as not to reopen the sore deep within it and bring back its circulation into the chest and reduce swelling, perhaps pausing again with oil applied, cleaned up daily.
If the unguent is not at your disposal, then rest in the bath with water drawn from below where dirty waters flow to that sick fluid may come out; and make sure the malady (gout) sleeps on top of the muddy ground so that clean water can circulate within it.

May it be that the healing of him/her is released, and as long as this holds true, you have already cured a fistula; therefore take care of them in your capacity (as a physician).
If the swelling is due to a gap in the space or wound and it's simple on the skin of the thigh or chest, then treat that with water previously applied for stitching if large, or powder if small.
If there is pain in the bone and if those stones are separated from it, then use forceps to remove them at that time. If they are not separated, then let them be drawn out that the vermin may escape from them; this is how their removal should be facilitated.
From other unexpected illnesses in the other body parts, health is restored with the same water that we have mentioned before.

The discomfalsh (disposition) that makes you ill in your stomach is either great or little, or wandering.
Disruption is difficult due to other maladies, and their reduction becomes hard if you do not remove them from their place of insertion immediately; this causes swelling in the breast as a result of what they have inserted into it.

Here comes your recommendation for each of you regarding examination and declaration.
So when the child is small and suffers from a hernia for that reason, it becomes difficult to reduce (the hernia), either because of its diminutive size due to birth trauma as we have mentioned before, or if the swelling occurs in the hernia due to cold air.
And when water is taken in, now cover the infused herb that you have submerged under a cloth alone or dipped into water while coughing up phlegm and using mustard seeds, pepper, and pumice to aid in resolving the inflammation within.
When certain measures have been taken in which water has entered the cavity where inflammation is present, it is better than water alone for its resolution of inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in which it was lodged with water and vinegar; thus being drained by a little cause from within itself.
If it is possible to release the patient from this treatment, then divide the breakdown into small parts with an instrument that has been previously drilled in (the joints).

Might the second stitch be common: and it is that you attend to the four limbs' ends—the neck and legs of the cistern (which may refer to a surgical procedure), using a needle with delicate finesse and thickness.
When the needle has entered these four extremities (hands and feet), reduce the needle of that piece from which you are working, to ensure that the wound cavity upward rises due to this intervention partway down into the ground, so that suturing is done with strong cloth as in such bandages.
When there is a pause between any of its stitches, it's about the quantity of the main body part in question.
This stitch is known by men.
E am such a suture was done where the patient, who resided in his belly and had been sick on one bed with major internal bleeding (from two palms inside the wound), due to bowel disruption internally or externally; therefore, you reduced that which the intestine had protruded through for 24 hours.

When the cause is when you continue recent labor at their sanctified place and alter that with which air changes it (i.e., during intense physical activity or exertion), return the intestine/hernia to its cavity, placing your hand over this area so as not for it to protrude outwards on top of its natural covering skin.
If the air has altered the humors and they have entered that which is at your present time within, causing pain in joints to become hard and swolthy of fields; let them be consolidated by poultices and watched over with care—and for this treatment similar as those used for other maladies when it has been healed.

It is wet for those with moisture in their bodies, and if the dampness has dissipated within some hours. Some moisture is moved herein, and it varies in amount and thickness; it's both plentiful and subtle.
And have shown all those causes and their symptoms are medicine in the division.
When you have thus made an effort to understand the treatment of this abscess which is caused by surgery,

And as for the seam at the site of decay, it is small just as we have discussed.
If decay is in the joint, open that corrupted joint, and cut off where it continues from the other part.
If decay is in the continuous flow of joints, it is not by chance but due to something else (likely an underlying medical condition or cause).
If the corruption is in the chest or on the skin/face, it's difficult; however, if you seek out where this decay appears and remove that portion using any means within your power to do so, then correcting such a condition for yourself can be done without causing harm when not against nature (body) itself.
Be aware of where the screws and saw teeth are meant for these bones according to their situation, as well as how prepared they should be in terms of size (grossness/smallness), flexibility (subtility), length (parvitation), hardness (duricity), and rarity; so that whatever tools you prepare will be suitable for this specific operation.

Additionally include guides placed at the neck (col), lower lip's underside; upper lip below and inside it too, known herein as lingual arteries; and vessels referred to as algelic ones: all these are included among mentioned structures for cauterization procedures by physicians who treat joint pain caused by cold humors. May the veins that have been cauterized in the breasts be full; from those is one cephalic and must be tied with wild thyme, and this they call "the vein of all limbs," and the domesticated thyme's vine they name it. They refer to it as the abdomen’se vein or "belly-vein", which has been cauterized in its leaf; called by vulgar language, “abdominal vein.” The arm's vessels are tied over the fireplace and this is where lymphatics reside. It lies between these two limbs (thighs), forming a pair of vines.
In the foot and thigh are three veins; one of those is for the curvature of the lower part of the leg, as in wildlife (deer); another is called saphenous, located at the junction between the body'dictor domestic; and there is also sciatic vein situated similarly.

If the basilica does not appear for apparent manifestation, then you should keep what was laid down and move it to another place; or bind any limb of yours that shows signs thereof; perform cauterizations at the end of your arm where symptoms are evident. Should these actions be necessary while we continue our discussion here:
May you wish to perform the surgery on your patient'dict, then move down to where there is a tightness in the arm that allows communication with the area of the wrists; place your hand over their vein which is part concave for amphorization (bloodletting); apply pressure here and dry out this vessel.

When addressing the constriction (swelling), consider that if a bloodletting procedure was performed and wounds were made into those masses within where veins are dilated/enlarged, they should be addressed with care as indicated by their symptoms or condition descriptions. The text suggests careful handling of these areas post-bloodletting to manage swelling effectively while acknowledging the patient's specific complaints related to inflamed and enlarged vessels within the affected masses (likely referring to varicose veins).
The practitioner should apply a poultice to the site of their bloodletting carefully using just enough oil as appropriate for treatment purposes; and pause at that point on the side indicated by symptoms/signs (likely referring to where varicose veins are present), above which performed bloodletting, so it may retreat slightly. The pulse must be felt over each affected vessel—thin ones wail like a string when bled upon and contract as they cease bleeding; if the poultice touches these thin vessels (indicative of varicosities), one should stop immediately with their tool, remove it from where veins are abound or excessively present. The text conveys that care must be taken not to press directly on a vessel—doing so may cause bleeding if the pulse is strong and contracts once pressure ceases; this implies awareness of varicose conditions possibly requiring delicate handling during treatment, reflective of medieval medical practices regarding bloodletting.
Therefore, it is that which causes the surgeon should be firm and solicitous in all these reasons.

And examine all these remedies for detection of them and their attempts at dealing with the decaying flesh upon them.
And when such special veins are discovered on the bone through which it has been struck and withdrazymed (bruised), they are avoided, held over lightly to prevent a blackbone breakage.
When treating fractures consider the wounds of the humors and if through those accidents you see signs that indicate fear (like vomiting from cholera, extension, loss of understanding, abscesses in joints/limbs, syncope, acute fever, pulse rates and groans), these symptoms do not contribute to healing.
If an accident occurs due to misguided things (or bad habits), then you begin healing the patient.
When the cause is that pus has entered into your meal with you and at those times when it appears in joints during days twelve through, as soon as possible study its position within the bone structure from morning until evening twelfth day completely.
If during summer days you press your elbows on the patient'dict knees throughout the day, they believe that this causes damage to their pancreas and triggers incidents recommended by us.
If the fracture has already reached the brain'dictum (covering of the brain), and it is made up of small fragments and ardor (inflammation or heat due to injury), then you must insert the broken pieces as instructed by me.
When you lift the head of the hernia and observe over the bones according to what is customary and natural for your body image, so that it lies flat on the hernia.
If you feel pain in the bone to detect its fracture or osteomyelitis waxy swelling, then hold yourself near it with water that flows within and out of it; this will allow rest for the inflamed area inside where there is relief from numbness. You are secure against the flow of pus (sank); begin infection treatment at the site of bone damage or excision.

If the bone does not penetrate into the periosteum, and where it has broken or become detached is its facies (face), roughness occurs along with fine points therein; hence you must remove that roughness and eraddict those fine points using what you have prepared for these purposes in various quantities so as to be able at any time to administer them appropriately throughout the body where they are needed, placing each dose straight from your tools according to when it is required during your surgical intervention of the broken bone and restoration of the patient's figure.

When a nose is broken, it implies trauma or injury requiring attention and potentially restorative measures by healthcare professionals:
Understand that the nose is not broken as such but rather divided into pieces by external force, with one piece being nasal bone (perhaps referring to septic fracture), which can be seen in radiographs; it's neither shattered nor subjected directly to impact since its breakage and deformation are consequences of twisting or compression.
If one of the bones is broken and you insert a small object into its nose (assuming this refers to setting up an external fixator), secure that fracture at the indicated place on top of it, beyond where the foot ends, until returning the nostrзу back according to its natural shape. If this is for your ease and make sure you do not harm it during that operation on the patient'thy thighs.
If the break is in the upper chest bone and does not move towards it, then cover what has been broken with a piece of wood from where that part lies (the injured area).
If the fracture is in two parts, then make it appear as much as you can.
And if the wound in your thigh is healing on the first day of injury, then that'dicts well; else, apply rest for seven or eight days as prescribed by inflamed area treatment (cautery).
Here the text translates to: Place a sheet of fabric in the patient's nose if there is a breakdown or fracture; apply splints where needed, filling up until it expands beyond the size of the nostril opening. Here are my line-by-line translation and interpretation:

If you apply a warm application poultice to the nose or chin with honey and oil rubbed on it, or an infusion of some kind (possibly referring to herbal tea). This suggests using heat therapy along with natural substances like honey for pain relief.

If you do not apply the poultice (which likely refers to one made from farina of sage and pepper mixed with alum powder), then coat that area with flour taken out of thyme seeds; place your hand over it, avoiding any possible cause. This indicates a different treatment method using specific herbs—thyme in this case (sometimes used for its antiseptic properties) combined and coated as an alternative remedy to cover the affected spot on one's body where poultices are not being applied directly; with hands over, they aim to prevent further issues. The passage suggests a traditional home-based approach using locally available materials before resorting to more direct application
If you have broken bones in your nose or if they are dislocated (implying that the displaced fragments can be manipulated back into place), then cover those areas with appropriate instruments as decided upon for them; and apply it therein, taking care of whatever fluid represents their essence within this body conditioning process. Here a practitioner advises to use tools specifically chosen by oneself (or presumably another medical professional)—to delicately realign any bone fragments or dislocated structures in the nose with these instruments; afterward they must apply an appropriate liquid, possibly representing blood for clotting and healing properties. This line is likely a complex directive from medieval medicine concerning emergency treatment using basic tools to manage traumatic injuries by restoring natural positioning of bone fragments or dislocations through manual intervention—followed by further care with specific fluids (blood, possibly obtained internally

If the jawbone is broken into pieces, then it'dict that you administer extension of parts according to proper positioning so that healing may be possible.
If you apply pressure to the wound and hope that it heals with silver or gold threads (or copper), then pause over the broken jawbone fragment, as well as a doubled cloth wrap placed on top of it; also place one pad solely along the length of the jawbone fracture—this is what you hold when dressed in your clothing and apply afterward without destroying.
When commanded by the malady (illness), let it rest and find peace, and stop swallowing its food bites (small portions of nourishment).
If the figure has become distorted in any manner, then you should apply pressure to that part on the third day; and correct what is already altered from it by applying a poultice made of chalk, egg white, or cornmeal paste, placing this directly onto the affected area with your hands.
And when that bandage is placed on him and the position of his bones remains unchanged, let it be so long as he recovers strength from this brokenness; for after three days such a break can generally begin to mend.
If another ulcerative condition occurs, apply what we have discussed for these previous wounds inside the patient until it is healed and that ailment has been alleviated as well.
If the fracture is freshly formed bone, consider whether it has separated from or been displaced by water (representing blood flow), and if so, apply that same fluid to where those fragments are within the skeleton during its treatment in this context.

When repeated heavy lifting of the dish leads to a broken sternum (fractured clavicle), it is classified into one of three types:
If it's broken (fractured), separated in two pieces that do not come together spontaneously without surgical intervention; or if there is an open wound, and treatment at the eating place/restaurant will be difficult; or when a child has suffered such fracture.
When the operation is carried out in that way, it means you make two servants present; one holds his hand as an assistant and supports the broken sternum there where it's fractured, while the other extends the chest over that divided area.

If the disruption of the stone you have inserted when extracting the seed is wide open and there are signs of suppuration (infection), then adjust the lips of the stone within it with stitches.
If the displacement is slight or you fear an abscess formation, apply poultices and pills according to the amount of separation in the flesh.
If you have an abscess that needs draining, then apply warm cloth and oil on it, and pause over the area where the action occurs.

If you proceed to the place of bone and apply forceful pressure with hands quickly (and hold), secure it there, as we have mentioned in regards to fixing the fractured sternum's clavicle joint if necessary here: This suggests that once immediate care is given by applying direct manual intervention at a specific location on the body—likely involving gentle but firm handling of bones and possibly immobilization with hand pressure or splints, especially for more severe injuries such as fractures (as referenced in connection to healing practices). In English: If you go directly to where the bone is located and press down quickly with your hands, hold it securely put there. We have already discussed

This sentence seems to be in a medieval Latin context, likely referring to the treatment of wrist and finger bones (the "pinch" being colloquial for one's hand or fingers).
You understand that when there is a break in the wrist and fingers (implied by "the pinch of the hand" or "pinches"), it's not to pity but rather careful attention required for their healing. Here, 'endeve fractura' refers to dealing with such injuries ('to deal'), while ‘atricio motas veguadas’ translates roughly as consistent care and vigilance in treatment – the
When you treat the wrist or hand fracture (injury), it's essential that cold humors follow their natural course and are removed thereafter every ten parts of equality—and place your hands over this stretched area to prevent further displacement. This line speaks about managing a bone injury with traditional remedies, suggesting the use of heat ('natural course') as part of treatment after an initial stage (which may involve some form of cold application or restraint), and then monitoring progress by assessing it every ten parts – possibly referring to body segments divided into equal portions for
Apply the minister (treatment or physician) to extend broken bones and ensure those within are well-aligned – this is what a skilled doctor would aim for in repositioning fractured limbs, ensuring proper alignment ('congongizio') during healing. Here 'o ministro' likely refers both to the person treating you (in English terms) as either
Watch if compression bandages and splints are used instead (as an alternative treatment), rather than allowing for ulceration to develop; place a stopper there below according to the area's extent – you have already wrapped it in linen or cloth ('drape'). This suggests monitoring wound care, particularly when using immobilization methods like bandages and splints. It also implies assessing how far an injury extends before applying treatment dressings (linen), which speaks about post-injury management with non-pharmaceutical interventions common in historical medical practice to prevent comp

If the fracture is at the extremities (parts away from the center), then stop pressing below and above on that part of the body with hands in palms, so that it becomes protected; also pause the tightness, as you turn your hand between the joints where the ligaments are.
If you break the bones of the fingers and toes (digits), then if it is your finger that has been broken, straighten it as best as possible using pressure with your palm, and pause for a short while there on the small splint so that the fracture can be elevated and not swolgy.
May it be so that if the fracture is in those places mentioned here (the hip joint), or at this place, or in the earlobe, or around the ankle; and they are all broken down continuously, better to stop over these small stones just as when we have them there on our feet.

May it be for the benefit of the knee joint' extrinsic ligament placed at the party of the patella, thus extending its compartment and allowing another fragment to heal properly outside in case there is a dislocation.
And if the dislocation is due to cold or rainy weather conditions, then it will be treated with ligaments suitable for dampness and its extension shall occur in the joints immediately.
Here the doctor applies a bandage to the two halves of the patient' extrinsic limb until you reduce it back to its natural state and joints are well joined by good union; provided that there is not spinal cord compression, which would affect an appendicized member. If there is an ulcer in you, then let that day be the time for its healing after which it returns to your care.
The strictures of the patient are painful: they wrap over the fracture with a hard bandage, folding it twice or three times until excess is removed; and then properly apply the wrapping so that it reaches down to the ankle and knee joints where their limbs meet.

From the breakdown: "Al talo (ankle) does not suffer breaks in total; however, some bones of the foot may experience it severely—and toes seldom get broken and instead bruise within their joints." This translation conveys that while ankle fractures are significant injuries on their own ("accideys"), they can vary. Some smaller structures in the foot, like bones (osses del pe), might not break completely but rather suffer severe damage or 'bruises,' which affect how joints move and function within these areas of injury ('mes de disposicio').
If the bones of the foot break and sometimes those very same bones are lifted between them themselves, then gout causes the patient' extrication from earth prepared for such occasion with antidote (prepared in advance).

When the hip bone of the woman is broken, it should lie in that position wherein it's slightly inclined towards the region between the two halves (the pelvis), and its hand held behind. This line indicates an old medical practice for treating a fractured pubic bone by placing it carefully at rest with supportive positions and handling to aid recovery, likely before modern orthopedic techniques were available.

When bones are broken in children, their healing process is generally faster compared to adults due to the presence of growth factors and cells with regenerative abilities that facilitate repair
It is convenient to the place where you cast the fracture when it comes in children, and mostly if that bone has grown considerably like hip or shoulder joints—or similar places near which one feels comfortable as their own body parts (which they cut out for casting at such time), then treat them similarly hereafter.
If the child flies away (refers to an infant or young patient who may have wandered off), then you must hold them back in your arms so that they do not scatter further and cause more trouble unless there is another reason for their escape.
When commencing to repair the fracture on that day, do not extend it further unless you encounter suppuration (infection).
May you apply cauterization if there' extruded swelling (possibly referring to an abscess), and after treatment inside the patient within one day until it subsides; by then do not introduce anything into them on the third or fourth days, otherwise bad accidents may occur.
If the bone is fractured and protrudes above the navel, then you must reduce that which has broken off therein with your hands for ease of manipulation and a little extension.
May it not be due to extension that you are unprepared, and the equipment of your patient is at their sides; then reduce this area with yours own hands as far as possible, using iron for its length which can range from seven or eight digits (fingers), and according to the size of the swelling, apply pressure accordingly. Therefore, it becomes necessary for a doctor who needs to compress these three or four times based on what is required in their overall treatment approach during bone healing/recovery.

(This translation assumes that "Capitol .xxi." refers to a specific section or page within an ancient text discussing
When a bone fracture is healed, it follows the Roman methods for subtlety and flexibility: these include multiple reasons such as improper use of ligature (which constricts nutrition to the limb), excessive tightness in places where the suture was applied; or surplus elastic bandaging which restrict movement beyond necessity, along with pain sensations within the cavity and for purgation purposes.
Care for the excess water is to drain it away from the body and make the patient's blood tender within, and apply bathing; administer gauze and tendernthy balm on them.
And apply pressure on the limb so that it draws nourishment back into its natural form, either by allowing blood flow or continuing with poultices immersed in water to restore vitality.

From the reduction of muscle dislocation, it can be translated to English as:
You understand that the muscle is not dislocated but rather in one of three ways: when it becomes dislocated at either end of movement or just after movement begins.
Here comes the second sentence to translate: It is about being dislocated from above in the muscle, and it hurts here; it does not concern the joints behind by the shoulder blade, nor those ahead due to nerves.
Mostly it is a displacement and departure of the body parts beyond their titillation, mostly in those where veins are thin (thin-veined areas), dislocation occurs; possibly even there when muscles contract with difficulty.
And when arsenic is applied by touch or crushing to the home area and the patient' extruded tendon has been apomedicalized with caution, it is compressed as needed where already displaced.
Now that you have bled out what has entered above while being overseated of it, proceed with its healing on yourself.
Here comes the translation: When dislocation occurs at the joints after being jolted; so that you can distinguish between the displaced muscle and its counterpart—thereby identifying differences manifested within them; thus, grinding down in the peak of the affected muscle where it connects to a bone head (olecranon), which cannot be reduced back into the joint or relieved entirely by any movement.
If you have a displaced knee or shoulder, and you must handle it gently without fear of harming them further.
From this dislocation it is felt a light reduction when it becomes cold and the malady enters into their abdomen.
E the reduction of him is for the minister to lift his body upwards into parts above; and after that place your hands firmly on those joints, lifting them therein until they regain strength in their position, and then pause briefly so he can return gently.
May it return if not already done, and when dislocation occurs within days, the swelling of the malady will be submerged in tailwater (likely referring to a type of water used for medicinal purposes), and administered with broth made from linseed (flaxseeds) that softens and lines the intestines along with fenugreek seeds and honey dissolved in this water, which is then given.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to reduce that second of this malady: then make present a long home belonging to it and located in its abdomen; immediately insert your muscle into the affected area quickly through the hernia, lifting upwards until the hernia is suspended in air. Another servant at once takes out the mass from between the patient'thy thighs (where one has placed a cushion), and another serves on their legs or chest while holding their hands. If the hernia is loose (expanded), then I will place that which causes it to be suspended, thus causing a return of its displacement immediately.

Extend your arm over it from another body part for strengthening and maintain alignment until quick return occurs to their proper location (rapid correction).
If reduction of him is difficult for all the reasons mentioned above, then use this treatment as follows: grasp a stick with the length that extends to two cubits, and hold it at an angle of four digits from the ground level according to this method.

When the food of the malady is reduced in quantity and comfort enters into the body, then restoration comes to you.
When food is given in larger amounts and some kind of motion occurs, and therefore if it closes and does not soften, then already heals.
May it be that if the joint is dislocated due to humidity or for another reason, then in such cases three kinds of treatments are administered as described in the book on treatment methods.
If all this pain is here and the ligament and joint are not closed after seven days of binding and casting reduction spells over them for some time, they will not be fixed in place nor can that arm go up to its parts above, but you know your nerves therein which lie at the head of muscles or their extension/softening; thus it shall never remain immobile.

Capitol .xxviii. (Note: Without additional context or understanding of medieval
Regarding the care for a joint displacement between the arm and body, it is at/in the joint where this occurs. (Note: This translation attempts to convey meaning given that medieval Latin often has different vocabulzure and grammar structures compared with modern languages like Italian or Spanish). Here
The displacement of the joint in/at it occurs some times (malasse), and its reduction is delicate; however, this also applies to other joints but especially where swift action at dislocation onset or when an apoplessic condition arises—where fracture has set. Here we mean that immediate attention may be needed if a displacement happens suddenly because it could lead to more serious complications such as bone fragmentation (apoptlesis).
The reduction of the dislocation is that you suspend the joint between the thigh and buttock on a table and have the attendant extend this area, while the doctor places their hand or palm over the impending joint movement to push it back into position.
Mayhap when the palm is resting on her stomach, it should be positioned with two of them over a table to extend and reduce; if dislocation has preceded, then place one under her so that its belly sits directly on top of the table, thus keeping the doctor's chest above any impending joint.
And if it returns soon enough, all is well; but if not, that part becomes inflamed and must be treated without delay; do not hesitate to perform the reduction of the patient'dicted pain as quickly as possible since these symptoms will persist for days.
Must the joint according to its curvature; and there is no cause in Maelwain, but it has been softened and cannot be strengthened—for you understand that nerves are twisted or slackened, and not hereby weaken, but rather with cautery provided for treatment will I confer some relief.
So when the pressure returns, place your hand over what has been applied to you, and keep it pressed for days. Also cut off its head (if necessary), wash it thoroughly every day; likewise cleanse and exercise that part of it where the cushion is placed.
May it happen that the patient' extrinsic movement is stopped and pain occurs in his tailbone or joints due to some weight gain, until he feels relieved (alleviated).
The provided text appears to be an instructional passage from a medieval medical treatise
Regarding the treatment of displacement injuries, here is the translation:
Alcune volte they are dislocated throughout the entire body.
When a joint is dislocated from either side of the hand or abdomen, then tighten and push the dislocation back into place until return occurs.
Hold up the head of this person and suspend it above where they are dislocated, leaving it thus for two days.
Return that which is above it into its cavity, and place your hand over what remains there today.
When soreness does not cease, then that second story tells us to keep it away from the day and night alternately, doing movements when necessary, so that fluid stays within those days until relieved.
When it seems like water (indicating a condition related to fluids or humors), if it is dislocated in the belly, bring that element together with this first operation performed into the body so that it heals.
When it appears that fluid (water) is coming out at other parts of the body as well.

May return to those who treat or examine them in various ways; may they already instruct on the methods of curing through eloquent speech, from which I have returned and explained using different instruments provided by these individuals for demonstration purposes.
From that one is not healed but only by what you apply directly on their two, as recommended for the water they have drunk.

Return the pillow on the table to the backbone (sacrum), and have the doctor press their feet onto the other end, so that the vertebra is compressed and returns to its proper place.
If you wish to bind the wound that has been turned upwards here; and it is necessary for you to keep your head at least part of its length above the patient's waist, which should be below the back end of two staves (the lengths being one arm long), with their heads also positioned downward towards the ground on both legs by means of these same staves; and such that there is a span between each staff—this has already been done in some part within any staff where movement occurs, and every piece firmly fixed to the ground so it does not wander.

Capitol XXVI.
Of hip joint dislocation.
You understand that the joint between the thigh and the muscle does not easily separate but rather dislocates so slightly, and you do not injure those places where other small joints meet with curvature.
The joint of the large is dislocated according to four ways, it can be dislocated at the divisions of the bones, or in front of them, or behind them, or below them.
Mostly it is dislocated at the joints' extremities, and seldom in between or behind the joints.
E when the dislocated limb is at the parts of pain it's long and hard put down el dedo to reduce inflammation from what was sane, thus not allowing the mal aligned thigh to bend its knee or for the foot tongue (hand) to move outwards towards apostema cautery targeting location where healing should occur.
And if that person' extraneous displacement is located in the parts beyond, it means these accidents are contrary to this misplacement.
Even the one to whom you have caused dislocation at this time spreads out under the cushion as a second complement; yet their pain does not double in the joint area here present; if it extends and cannot be managed over these parts, then urine is retained within them, and an abscess forms on the patient's body. And you must walk with the aid of your toes at this point.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and if the dislocation is ancient and longstanding, as already administered by your own treatment here at Rome according to its arrangement; hence there will not be any more miracle in that cure. And so we refrain from hoping for a further improvement within that old remedy.
In which the dislocation is recent and one of the four types of dislocation, then turn your head to realign that part and extend it back to both limbs (upper/lower parts), left and right sides respectively; once returned this way you will not need other forms of treatment.
May it be that if the issue does not return in this attempt at healing, then those who prepare my remedy must make sure to deliver and spread out the pillow I placed under them just now or on their bodies; another servant extends the bandage from above as they press down with their hands swiftly; firmly secure a strip of cloth over that spot so it stays in place below while stretching, then hold onto its end by hand where necessary.
When it extends from this place (the area being referred to), or where the shoulder joint is located towards the breastbone'dictor of the shoulders, or between the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae:
When all of them experience extension within a period that allows the humidity to rise up and break, it is time for their body' extrication from the ground level due to excessive moisture in the air (implying an imbalance or overflowing of "humors" leading to physical manifestations such as swelling).
This specific type of extension occurs in all four (or people/groups referred to). Here is the translation line by line into English from Latin-influenced medieval medical terms:
And if the dislocation returns by water that we have mentioned, then be silent (sir); otherwise, it is necessary for all special waters required in one'thy own cure.
In the reduction of oneself, when it is dislocated, and its displacement happens at parts divided by ligaments/tendons (this connects thigh with chest), ensuring that the hernia sits on one'thy own back; and taking pause for the tendons between the shoulder joint in that place where the head of the scapula meets the socket of the arm bone, holding them.
And another minister with great pressure applies the arms of him/her on the large hernia in the thigh and extends it forcefully until that one returns to its original place.
This particular substance is of yellow bile that causes this member to be reduced, compared to other substances.
If you are able to stand on your feet and not obey the entrance herein of this special kind of healing that is present in both legs at once with strong ligaments (leg bones), thighs, calves, ankles, holding them together firmly, then:
Whenever any part of the body is proportionate to four cubits in length, and when the hernia expands as much as two cubits, then so it shall be with each respective limb.
And raise the patient'dictum (presumably meant to be 'patient') up on their chest, so that it is in its place; and let his body length from the ground equal two fathoms (approximately six feet).
Here comes the first sentence to translate: Command a strong youth that reduces the head of the thigh, and have another young man suspended therein; yet another young person will reduce the hip joint back at their strength, so quickly it returns to its place.
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated from the anterior part, where the hump of the belly protrudes according to what we have recommended in the abdomen's jelly-like state; and its sinews are placed directly on the swolthy belly and chest.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Each minister extends to his/her portion, and the doctor holds it in accordance with the art.
When dislocation occurs to the parts downstream, then cover that change with leggings and pause there on my hand, which is placed over the groin area by myself (doctor), describing what happens next; and I stop pressing this one limb against another while pausing at the part of joint movement.
If the dislocation is at the parts behind (the hip and knee region), do not let the groin be extended to these areas; they have a resting place on solid ground; those who cover it are there because of hard causes, as we mentioned earlier about its position relative to two broad surfaces—it should now stretch outward over its face and ligaments likewise (meaning without any pain); thus, there is no need for further intervention.
When a compression is applied over the location where pain occurs in the joint connection,
So that the reduction is complete as instructed—and the term for 'reduction' does not concern you, but rather extending cushions from below (the thighs), once those are adjusted and when the leg massage extends beyond its scope, then understand that the corresponding limb returns to place; thus ensuring the wide band is not protruding in any of the parts. Keep the swelling at bay for three days or four by adhering it with an ointment/bandage as needed.
Return the ligaments and bandages as they are compared with each other.
And if you see those lumps in the patient'dict state, you realize that the dislocation is already fixed, and thus let the hump go.
If you see any cause of suppuration (infection), then return and apply that bandage according to your first technique, and leave it on for three days.
Return that part of it, and allow it time for movement on these matters over several days until they are comfortable.
Since I don'thy provide translations directly from capital letters or Roman numerals
The phrase "Capitol" followed by a sequence of characters and numbers does not seem to be an actual text in any language that I
The shoulder is dislocated according to three movements: it has been dislocated from the parts above (forearm and upper arm), downwards towards the digits, forward into the chest area – these are considered anterior or frontward sections; but not in those directions that come after them. Essentially, this means that if a shoulder is dislocated, its usual range of motion has been altered due to displacement from specific anatomical positions: upwards towards and above (like raising the arm), downwards at the level where digits are found or lower than (such as moving wrists below their normal positioning when extending arms forward) within one's own
The sign of a shoulder being out-of-place is for the humoral to apply its cushion upon the hip area – this implies that when recognizing if someone's shoulder joint has become displaced, you should command or tell it (likely referring metaphorically here) to position itself accordingly. This line advises a practitioner on how they might signal an issue with alignment and movement of the humoral element—often associated in traditional medicine with body fluids
The restoration of all the movements of the shoulder is achieved by manipulating (correcting) the humoral in place – ensure that it can extend its cushion, if possible above; apply your hand to hold down both thighs and pause with pressure on the back part of the patient's body. Additionally position two more servants: one extends their palm over where bones meet at shoulder joint (the acromioclavicular area) for support – this is believed to help strengthen it, while another servant expands its reach inside as long as the humoral remains in place above the patient’s arm. This intricate guidance underscores a hands-on approach where practitioners use their own limbs and additional objects (possibly symbolic or actual tools) for external manipulation to realign joint structures, with emphasis on maintaining specific positions while applying pressure strategically across various areas of the body related directly to shoulder dislocation.
And it is his duty (or role) that their cushion remains attached at the thigh joint, not laboring without rest.
Return that and fasten it to the thigh covering therein, placing those around one bandage for three or four days, and applying them accordingly.
Not use the humoral fluid for walking on these days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of it is excused from you, then apply strong extension on the ligaments which were described in its previous treatment for the joint health.

The translation of the given medieval medical text into English regarding treatment for talus (ankle) displacement:
The translation of the given medieval medical treatise line by line into English would be as follows:
When healing of the patient is through ease and extension at hand while returning inside where it belongs to go back.
When the treatment comes as per its complement and you fix the hips rightly using a strong minister from behind of that body' extrinsic position in this place,
And place yourself on the sole of your right foot belonging to the patient'dict body, and also rest your left hand at the location where their belly button is situated in the hollow of the cavity.
Return the leg to its position (the third), and correct it with your left hand for two movements, bringing the foot back into place using the heel of your right hand; thereby moving the patient'thy calf in coordination with their thigh cradle/cushion.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And thus he inserts his finger into the cushion firmly pressed against it gently; you are at the hernia (or inguinal canal).
Therefore if he returns to health within a week or two following this treatment, and when the body becomes uncomfortable again (i.dict while lying down), repeat the operation; otherwise, that individual will not return as before.
May you not perform the reduction of him whom we have recommended today; if this is prohibited, let his malady complain between his thighs on the ground below, and place a closed bed sheet over him to prevent that from happening.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The minister of medicine holds their hips and extends either leg or sling over them that lies on top of their chest, stretching it out between the thighs compressed by this force so that his body is not drawn back toward parts today.
The doctor inserts the displacement into their joints, and another minister holds the healthy area of hernia together until the displacement returns to ease.
When the dislocation returns and it is declared to you that there'thy restoration has been made, then apply an adhesive bandage strongly, and bind the foot limb to the cushion.
When you fear or protect the nerves located behind the heel, to prevent the ligament from being violent and leading it astray.
Return that particular for two or three days, and if the ligament softens, extend it further.
Return that item in the morning or afternoon and prevent gout by keeping it off for 40 days. If you go further into that space, it is not certain that the detachment will not be loose and corrupt on this body of yours; nor can they receive treatment at all without your consent.
If you apply a caust to him, then provide treatment in the place where we previously described it herein, for healing and bandaging purposes until his condition is improved.
