The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is a complete part of the science of medicine, and having reached its limit in clarity and explanation, has seen fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of practical application by hand.
Because practical application by hand is utterly lacking in our country and our time, to the point that the study of its science nearly ceased and its trace disappeared. But only a few traces of it remained in the books of the ancients, which have been distorted by hands, affected by error and confusion, until its meanings became obscure and its benefit distanced itself.
Therefore, I have seen fit to revive it and compose this chapter on the path of explanation, clarity, and brevity, and to present images of cauterizing irons and other tools of the work, for it is an addition to clarity and a collection of what is needed.
The reason there are no skilled practitioners with their hands in our time is that the practice of medicine is long, and its practitioner must first exert himself in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he may grasp the benefits of the organs, their preparations, temperaments, connections, and disconnections, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number and exits, pulsating and stagnant veins, and their points of exit.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the practical craft. We have mentioned a portion of this in the introduction to this book.
Because he who is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is likely to make mistakes that will kill people, as I have witnessed often in those who imagine themselves knowledgeable in this field without knowledge or understanding.
I have seen an ignorant physician who incised a swine-like tumor on a woman's neck, then severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled to death in his hands.
I saw another physician, attempting to remove a stone from an elderly man's bladder, the stone being large. He acted rashly, and removed it by cutting a piece of the bladder itself. The man died about three days later.  I was called to remove it, and having seen the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I was aware of the danger.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine with some merchants of our city.
A dark-skinned boy had a fracture near his heel, along with a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bound the fracture to the wound tightly with splints and bandages, leaving no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged his desires, and left him for days, telling him not to loosen the bandages until his leg and foot had swollen and he was close to death.
I was summoned to him.  I quickly loosened the bandages, and he found relief and lessened his pain, but the damage had already set in firmly in the limb, and I could not stop it.
The damage continued to spread throughout the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a large, cancerous tumor.  After a few days, it ulcerated, and the patient's condition worsened.  This is because if the cancer is purely black, it should never be treated with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual treatment can be divided into two categories: treatment that is accompanied by safety and treatment that is often accompanied by injury.
I have warned in every place in this book about work that carries risk and fear, and you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant might not find a way to speak ill and criticize, use caution and firmness, and show kindness and certainty in your treatment.
Use the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
Purify yourselves from that which you fear might bring doubt to your religion and worldly affairs, for it is more enduring for your reputation and raises your standing in this world and the hereafter.
Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a bad disease and call yourselves bad physicians.
This article has been divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
In cauterization with fire and cauterization with sharp instruments, a chapter arranged from the heel to the foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cauterizing tools, and everything necessary for manual operation.
The second chapter.
On incisions, punctures, venesection, cupping, surgeries, the removal of arrows, and similar procedures, all arranged in chapters, with illustrations of the instruments.
The third chapter.
On fractures, dislocations, the treatment of sprains, and similar conditions, arranged in chapters from the heel to the foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before describing the procedure, it is necessary to discuss its benefits and drawbacks, and in which temperament it should be used.
I say that the discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization, its subtleties, and hidden secrets, is a lengthy and detailed matter; many wise men have spoken upon it.
Their opinions differed, and I have concisely summarized the essential points from their discussions, fearing to prolong the text.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every ill temperament, with or without material cause, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without material cause, and the dry temperament without material cause.
As for the dry temperament with a material cause, they differed. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others argued the opposite, stating that cauterization is not suitable for illnesses caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry illness with a hot, dry remedy.  The one who argues against this says that cauterization with fire may indeed benefit from a hot, dry illness that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say with him, because experience has revealed this to me repeatedly, although this should only be considered by someone who has practiced and trained extensively in the art of cauterization. And to understand the diverse temperaments of people and the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for other temperaments, there is no fear of them, especially cold, moist illnesses.  All physicians agree on this and do not disagree on the benefit of cauterization in their case.
Know, my children, that the secret of treating with cauterization by fire lies in its superiority over cauterization with a burning medicine, because fire is a simple element whose effect is limited to the organ cauterized and does not harm another connected organ except to a slight degree.
Cauterization with burning medicine may extend its effect to other organs and possibly cause an incurable illness in the organ, and perhaps even death. Fire, because of its noble and precious nature, does not do this unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of our service and care in the craft, and our understanding of the facts.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse; if it were not unbecoming to this book, I would have presented to you the secret and method of fire's action on bodies, and its removal of diseases, through a rigorous philosophical argument that delves into your understanding.
Know, my children, that they differ on the time suitable for cauterization, and have deemed the best time to be spring.
I say that cauterization may be suitable at any time, for the harm caused by the season is outweighed by the benefit obtained through cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a pressing, severe, and dangerous ailment that cannot tolerate delay, lest a greater calamity result than the slight harm caused by the season.
Do not think, my children, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine: that a cauterization which cures a disease will never return and that you make it permanent.
And the matter is not as you suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that changes the temperament and dries the moisture that is the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is preferable to medicine due to its speed of success, strength of action, and intense power.
The disease may return at some time, depending on the patient's temperament, the severity and strength of the disease, and the accumulation of impurities within the body, and neglect of acquiring proper foods and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one in a part of the body with few impurities and moistures. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like; in such cases, the pain may not return, and this will be the least.
Also, the common saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is a correct statement, not in the sense they believe, because they believe that no treatment will help after cauterization, but the matter is different.
The meaning of cauterization being the last resort in medicine is that when we have employed various treatments for a disease, and those medications have not been effective, and then we use cauterization as the last resort, and it is successful, then in this case, cauterization is said to be the last resort in medicine. Not in the sense understood by the general public and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, because they said that gold is balanced and noble in its nature, and that the cauterized spot does not suppurate, but this is not universally true.
Because I have experienced it, and found that it only does this on some bodies, and not others, and cauterization with it is better and superior to iron, as they said, but if you heat the gold cautery in the fire, you will not be able to ascertain when it is heated to the desired degree of gold's redness.
Because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and fuses, which puts the craftsman in trouble; therefore, cauterization with iron is, in our opinion, faster and more accurate for use, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections arranged from the head to the foot, so that the student can easily find what he needs, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cauterization of the head is single cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excessive moisture and cold in the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent colds from the head to the eye and ear area, excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat. And generally, for all diseases resulting from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, stupor, and similar ailments.
The procedure for this cauterization is to first instruct the patient to induce vomiting with a laxative medicine that is good for the head, for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and usual condition.
Then, instruct him to shave his head with a razor, then have him sit before you, squatting, with his hands on his chest.
Then, place the base of your palm on the base of his nose, between his eyes. Where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then, heat the olive oil cautery, which has this form.
If the bone is exposed to the size of a needle's head or a carob seed, remove your hand. Otherwise, reheat your hand with the same iron or another if it cools down. Until you see the bone as I described to you. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it. Place it on the affected area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in ghee and leave it there until the burning sensation subsides.  Then treat it with the four-component ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it produces, and that this is better and more beneficial.
Some say to cauterize the skin down to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone's thickness is burned.  Then to remove the burned bone and subsequently treat it.
Others say that one should cauterize intensely, affecting the bone profoundly, so that it falls away like a small piece of quartz or a small fragment.  They claim that this expels vapors from the head from that area, leaving the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not at all consider these two types of cauterization except in some people and with a degree of risk.  Leaving it alone is preferable in my opinion.  And with safety, if it is so, the head weakens when its natural connection is broken apart, as we have seen in all the other organs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and preferable in my opinion. Use it, and you will be safe, God willing.
Second Chapter.
On cauterization of the head.
If a persistent pain occurs in the entire head, and this affliction has lasted a long time for the patient, and they have used poultices, cataplasms, flagellations, ointments, and bandages, and especially if a single cauterization (as we described) has not helped, then consider... If the patient's head is strong by nature and not weak, and if they experience intense cold, cauterize again slightly above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize each horn of the head with a cauterization until the thickness of the skin is gone and the bone is exposed to the extent we described. And cauterize with a cauterization at the back of his head, in the place known as the axe; be gentle here, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience intense pain there, unlike the pain of all other head cauterizations. I will mention this cauterization in its proper place.
The cautery used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head.  This is its form.
Chapter three.
In cauterization of the chronic sister.
If pain occurs in the skull fissure, accompanied by headache and extending to the eye, let the patient be purged with head-clearing medications, and use all the other treatments I have mentioned in the classifications of diseases.  If that is not successful, the cauterization is of two types. Either by cauterization with a strong, burning medication, or by iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medication, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then slit the painful area of the temple with a wide scalpel, until there is a space under the skin large enough to accommodate the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then compress it firmly with a bandage for fifteen hours.  Then remove it and take out the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a dressing.
Apply a cotton swab dipped in clarified butter until the area becomes suppurated. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medications I have provided in the eighteenth chapter on burning medications.
As for cauterizing with iron, do it in this way: heat the cautery iron, whose shape is as follows:
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some grooves and a small projection in the center.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while rotating the iron slightly, until the burn on the skin's thickness is about half of it. Then remove your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath, causing bleeding, and soak a cotton swab in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then cover the cotton with oil, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this vein with the pointed, knife-like part of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this vein, especially the chronic one.
Fourth Chapter.
Cauterizing a chronic vein.
If you have treated the vein using the previous treatments and the treatments mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment proves ineffective, and you see a cause that the previously mentioned cauterization, either by medicine or fire, cannot address. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white, after marking the location of the pain with a line half a finger in length or so.  Leave your hand once, pulling it steadily until the artery is cut and it reaches the bone.
However, you must be careful not to touch the jaw that moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasm.
Be cautious and vigilant of the bleeding from the artery you have cut, for there is risk in cutting it. Especially for those who do not know what they are doing and have not been a practiced hand. To abandon the procedure is better.
We will discuss the treatment of accidental arterial bleeding in its proper place in the book, God willing, if you see a condition for which this cauterization is not suitable.
If you see the patient's body capable of it, cauterize a spot in the middle of the head, as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, you may use the cautery mentioned in the chapter on severing the artery with the two-bladed cautery; it is a better and more effective cautery than this one.
Fifth Chapter.
On cauterizing earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then heat the cautery, called the point, which has this image.
Then, after heating it, drip it around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in both. Move the cautery slightly from the base of the ear after marking the area with ink. The cautery should be about ten drops in each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the areas until healed, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing the ear.
The ear ailments treated by cauterization are of the type caused by phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasms.
If, having treated this type of earache with irrigations, poultices, and gargles, your treatment is unsuccessful, then the afflicted person should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be done in the form of a cauterization opposite the upper part of the ear, slightly below the temple, and another one in the temple, with a length equal to the thumb.
Bring your cautery hand down until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery iron, which is a kind of knife, whose image was previously presented, but it is slightly milder than it, as you see. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization for chronic stroke.
If the stroke has become chronic and you have treated it with what we have mentioned and your treatment has not been effective, and there is no fever in the patient, cauterize four times. A cauterization on each temple, a cauterization in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and a cauterization at the back of the head, as previously stated.
The method of cauterization, as previously mentioned, and a cauterization may also be applied to the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective. Then treat with what has been mentioned previously.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
The one that arises from phlegm, the patient should first be given large doses of purgatives and herbs that purify the brain.
Then, his entire head is shaved, and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, is applied to his back multiple times.  This is a type of cauterization.
And do this in the same manner as I mentioned there. If he recovers from this, then cauterize him with three cauterizations on the back of his head, arranged from the top of the head to the lower neck.
Place the thickness of a finger between each cauterization. Then, treat the cauterization as previously described. If you desire further treatment, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you want further treatment, cauterize him on the temples, and then treat him until he is healed.  The cautery should be olive-oil based, in the manner previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and relaxation of the entire body.
First, cleanse the head with the remedies we've described. Then shave the patient's head and cauterize one point in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the cervical vertebrae. If the ailment of relaxation of the body requires more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is severe and entrenched, cauterize four points on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize until most of the skin is burned, and then raise your hand. Treat it as described earlier until, God willing, it is healed. Use an olive-oil cautery.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
The epileptic, whose epilepsy is due to phlegm, should first have his brain cleansed with large leeches and with all other treatments mentioned in the section, if the patient is strong and can tolerate taking medications.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then he should use gargles and mouthwashes to cleanse the brain many days before that, while also improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and cauterize him with one cauterization in the middle of the head, as was described previously, and another cauterization at the back of his head. And on each temple of his head, a cauterization. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauterizations mentioned in the section on paralysis and body relaxation at the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the cauterization should be olive-oil based, as described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the cauterization gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humours and thick phlegm, cauterize him with the cauterizations we described for paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile and the patient's body is moist and corrupt, purge what will purify his brain, as mentioned in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of flax like a circle, then place it in the middle of his head. The patient sits crouched, holding it from all sides. Then take one pound of old sheep's lard.
Then heat it over the fire to a moderate heat, as much as the finger can tolerate if inserted into it. Then empty it into the circle on his head and let it cool. Do this to the patient once a week with the rest of his good care, until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, scattered points without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather by a kind of fumigation.  This type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cloth soaked in lard or chicken fat to him.
The twelfth chapter.
On cauterizing the water that flows from the eye.
If you perceive the water flowing from the eye initially by the signs mentioned in the classification, then quickly treat the patient, cleanse his head, and protect it from all moisture.  Sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for days.
Then shave his head and cauterize it once in the center of the head, and cauterize twice on the temples, if the water is flowing from both eyes or from one side if it is only one eye.
Then, with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations extend lengthwise and across the temples, while preventing any blood loss.
If you see anything of it, cut it in place with any treatment possible, and we will come to the wisdom of dealing with arteries, cutting them, and preventing bleeding.
And it may be cauterized twice deeply in the nape of the neck, under the two bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and they originate from veins and arteries on the surface of the head, and you are certain that this is from superfluous, thick, phlegmatic coldness, then cauterize with the cautery described by itself in the beginning of the descending water. A cautery in the center of the head, and two cauteries on the temples, and two cauteries in the nape of the neck under the bones.  And if you need more, cauterize with a cautery on each side of the eye's corner at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
Concerning the cauterization of foul-smelling noses.
If you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is ineffective, then immediately shave the patient's head and cauterize the middle part with the olive oil cautery. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauteries above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it.  This is a depiction of the nail-shaped cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the cauterization of eyelid relaxation.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two cauteries on each side, spaced from the temples, and the length of each cautery should be equal to the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the point where one-third of the skin is burned.  And the shape of the cautery iron should be like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its eyelashes turn inward and injure the eye, cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization by fire or cauterization by a burning medicine.  As for cauterizing it with fire, you should first instruct the patient to remove his eyelashes, if he is one who plucks them, so that they grow long and even.
If it injured it while growing, bind his eyes with a bandage to prevent movement until they grow, and when they have grown and are even, place the patient's head on your lap, then make a mark on the eyelid with ink in the shape of a leaf.
Begin the mark near the eyelashes, then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or the saliva of the badger under the eyelid. Then heat an iron.  This is its image.
Then cauterize it in the shape you marked, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin burns completely, like a whole, visible leaf of the mugwort. A sign of your successful work is that you see the eyelid has drawn back, and the hair has risen from the eye's flesh.
Then lift your hand, and leave him for three days.  Then apply a cotton swab with ghee, until the scab is removed. Then treat with ointment until he is healed, God willing. If some hair grows back later and the eyelid relaxes,
Then repeat the cauterization at that spot as you did at first. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not injure the eye. As for cauterization with the burning medicine, tell the patient to leave the eyelashes to grow long and even.
Then make a picture of a mugwort leaf from paper. Then take from the usual soap and quicklime, one dirham or similar weight of each. Grind them both thoroughly, doing so quickly so they do not dry. Then spread it on the paper, shaped like a mugwort leaf, and place it on the one or both eyelids. Place a cotton swab soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and gently press it as you move it whenever the patient feels the medicine burning, because it feels like fire. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger.  Once the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And see if you see the eyelid has risen, as it rises when cauterized by fire or cut. Otherwise, apply more medicine to the spot where the medicine did not take effect and did not turn black, until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then place cotton with ghee on it, until the heat's irritation subsides.
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You should, when working, take the utmost precaution that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.  If the eyelid relaxes after a few days and you fear any hair in the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to that part of the eyelid that has relaxed, just as you did at first, and treat it until it heals.  This is a depiction of a mugwort leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size and age.  Therefore, let your cauterization be appropriate to this.  The path to correctness is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the fistula that appears in the eye's corner.
If you treated the fistula with the methods described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment was not successful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and have a servant hold the head firmly, without movement or shaking.
Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or the juice of a  *barzquṭūn* (possibly a type of plant) on his eyes, and then heat the cautery iron, whose shape is as illustrated.
It should be hollow, like the shaft of a bird of prey's feather, on the one side where the cautery is applied.  If you wish, the other end can be pierced or, if you prefer, solid like a rod. However, the hollow one is better for your procedure, God willing.
Then, squeeze the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus and dry it, or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus.  Then apply the cautery iron, very hot, and hold it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that you do not miss the mark or disturb the patient, and the cautery iron does not fall on the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then stop. Otherwise, reheat the cautery iron if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton pad with clarified butter and treat it with the desiccated ointment until it heals. If, after forty days, it has not healed, apply the strong, corrosive medicine to expose the bone and pare it according to what will be described in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the fistula, described by some of the ancients, is to carefully cut open the fistula and insert a thin funnel into the incision—this is its image.
Pour in molten lead, weighing about a dirham, and hold the funnel firmly in your hand; the patient must remain absolutely still, so the molten lead does not flow into their eye. You should place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the fistula and cure it remarkably. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment described, then well and good. Otherwise, it is necessary to use the nasal speculum and reposition the fistula into the nasal passage, as will be described in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
Cauterization of cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, often called a "hairlip," frequently occurs, especially in the lips of young boys.  If treatment using the methods described in the classification is unsuccessful, apply a small, knife-like cautery iron in this manner.
Make its cavity as thin as a knife, then apply it hot immediately to the cleft itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with *qiyruți* until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
Cauterization of a fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling develops at the base of the gums, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then ulcerates and bursts, forming a fistula from the discharge of pus, and if treatment is unsuccessful, then a cautery iron, sized to fit inside the fistula, should be heated.
Then, introduce it hot into the opening of the fistula, and hold it until the heated iron reaches its depths and furthest point. Do this once or twice.  Then treat it afterward with the treatment we previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
If the matter [pus/discharge] stops and heals, then well and good. Otherwise, it is necessary to examine the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be explained in its section, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
For loosened teeth and gums.
If the gums have become loose due to moisture and the teeth have shifted, and treatment with medicine has been ineffective, then place the patient's head in your lap.  Then heat the cautery iron, the image of which will come after this, and place the tube onto the tooth.
Quickly insert the hot cautery iron, and hold it for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth. Then remove your hand. Then repeat the cautery iron several times as desired.  Afterwards, have the patient rinse his mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out.  The loose tooth will become firm, and the relaxed gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or worms, and the medication is ineffective, cauterization can be done in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or a shell.  Then, take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a probe, dip it in the boiling butter, and place it quickly on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  Alternatively, you can dip wool or cotton into cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then place a heated iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the base of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, use a brass or iron tube, somewhat thick to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth.  Then, heat the cautery iron and place it on the tooth itself, holding it until the iron cools. Do this repeatedly.
The pain will disappear either on the same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you choose, according to what is possible. This is an image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing pigs.
If pigs are affected by phlegm and cold moisture, and do not respond to maturation with medication, and you want rapid maturation, then heat the hollow cautery iron, whose image is shown, with both ends perforated.
To allow smoke to exit from the other end during cauterization, hold it on the same tumor for a time, and again if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron the same size as the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab soaked in clarified butter until what was burned by the fire disappears, then treat it with ointment and lint until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm dominates the trachea, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with laxative medications, then cauterized with a cautery at the notch of the throat, near the base of the gullet, in the low-lying area.
Be careful not to reach the gullet with the cauterization, and burn only half of the skin.  Then cauterize another time at the joint of the neck, at the end of the last bead of it, with a strong cauterization.  Let the cautery be a pointed one, as described previously.
Then treat him/her with what was previously mentioned until he/she is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughs.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and the patient does not have a fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones, in the soft, empty, low-lying areas, and once more in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be a pointed one, as previously described.  If you wish, let the cauterization be by dripping from a cautery called the "point," the image of which was previously shown in the section on treating ear pain.  The points should number from thirty or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he is healed.  You may also use a three-pronged cautery, in the manner described,  and hasten the cauterization, as you cauterize three areas at once with this.  This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture or does not stay in place when returned from dislocation, so that it becomes habitual to dislocate and then dislocates at the slightest movement, as we have seen, the jaw must first be repositioned. Then the patient lies on his back or on his right side, and the skin inside the armpit is lifted upward with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then the double-bladed cautery, which is depicted in this picture, is heated.
Then, cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side.  The cauterization pattern is four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a three-bladed cautery in which case the pattern will be six cauterizations, and the blades are the thickness of the vessel.
This is a picture of the three-bladed cautery.
One more may be added to this number, making eight cauterizations.  Then, the pounded balls of medicaments mixed with salt are applied to the cauterization. The patient must rest and not move the limb for a time until it strengthens.  Dislocation upward is infrequent.
Apply one good, nail-like cauterization or multiple small cauterizations above the shoulder blade.  Then, the joint will become stronger and the moisture will disappear, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If the stomach is afflicted with cold and excessive moisture, disturbing its temperament, and frequent discharges occur despite treatment with various remedies, the patient should lie on their back, extend their legs and arms, and then be cauterized three times. Apply one cauterization beneath the breastbone, sized like a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery iron, and two more below, each alongside the initial cauterization to create a triangular pattern.  Space them appropriately so that they do not join if they become infected. The depth of the cauterizations should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the cauterizations should be triangular.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the center of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
The stomach may also be cauterized by puncturing.  For those who fear this method, one may apply dots to the stomach, as desired, with ink, then cauterize them with a pointed cautery iron, and then treat them with the previously described treatment until healed.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If a pain in the liver arises from cold and moisture, or from a hot wind, to the point that it has departed from its natural temperament in excess, and the patient has been treated as described in the classification, but that treatment has been ineffective. The patient should lie on their back, and three cauterizations should be applied with ink to the liver, exactly like this shape and size, beneath the collarbones, where the human arm's bend ends.
After each cauterization, there should be the thickness of a finger's width between them. The cauterization should be along the body in a straight line, and do not press the iron with your hand forcefully.
The amount of skin to be burned should be about half its thickness, no more.  The patient should stand on their feet; if unable, they should lie down with legs extended and arms raised. This is the shape of the cauterizing iron.
You may be able to perform these cauterizations with a knife-like cauterizing iron if you are skillful and careful in your technique, taking precautions not to overdo the cauterization, burning the entire skin and reaching the belly and intestines; the skin there is thin, so know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Cauterization of a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if the tumor is in the liver's flesh or its lining, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will experience heaviness and pain, but not severe pain.
But if it is in the liver's lining, the pain will be intense and severe.  If the physicians have exhausted their treatment options, the patient should lie on their back, and then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, the cautery resembling a spatula, and this is its image. Cauterize it with a single cauterization until all the skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the lining, so that all the matter is expelled, then treat it with the treatment for abscesses until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be performed by someone with extensive experience in the medical arts, who has treated these illnesses repeatedly. Only then should they undertake such a procedure.  To leave it to someone else would be better.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients described cauterizing cold fistulas with the roots of the zeraوند plant, as follows: take one long, dry root of the zeraوند, as thick as a finger, then dip it in oil and heat it in fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly angled towards the area beneath the chin, and two larger cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, angled slightly backward, another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach. Three cauterizations on the back, one between the shoulders and two on the flanks, below the cauterization that is between the shoulder blades.
One should not insert the cauterizing instrument deeply, but rather use it on the surface of the skin, lightly touching it. Some of the ancients stated that some people used an iron cauterizing tool similar to a spatula, heating it and using it to reach the tumor between the ribs.
The pus will discharge, as we mentioned in the case of a liver tumor, and in this instance, cauterizing the abscess carries the risk that the patient will die immediately or that an incurable fistula will form at the site.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If the treatment of the spleen, as described in the previous section, is ineffective, cauterization can be applied in three ways, all of which are correct: one is to cauterize it three or four times, in a line along the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations previously described, and there should be a space between each cauterization the width of a finger, or slightly more.  Use the same cautery as described for liver cauterization.  Do not make the cauterization deep.  The patient should be lying on their back.
The other method is at the elbow, lifting the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends.  Lift the skin across the width of the body so that the cauterizations run lengthwise along the body.
Then, insert the cauterizing instruments, very carefully, until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then, withdraw the cautery, leaving four cauterizations. If desired, use the three-pronged cautery instead.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing it to discharge pus for many days. This is more effective than any other treatment described previously.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascites (dropsy of the abdomen) in particular. If you have treated the person suffering from dropsy with the various treatments we have previously mentioned in the classification and your treatment has been ineffective, then you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization should be performed on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on his back between the ribs, one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach.  The depth of the cauterization should be nearly equal to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient with further treatment after cauterization, as is necessary for the gathering of the relevant factors to accelerate his recovery.  The shape of the cautery used for the back is pointed, as was previously described, and the one used for the front is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If the feet swell in dropsy and become filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cautery and do not bend it; then raise your hand and do not lower it again, for this will allow the yellow water to drain out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be with the sharp tip of the cautery, and the cauterizations should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that, towards the middle of the leg.  Do this twice on each thigh.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, allowing the water to drain out, then treat it with the rest of the methods we have described.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, weakening the binding and digestive forces in the stomach and intestines, and if other treatments have failed to cure it, and if you see the patient is strong enough to tolerate a cauterization, then cauterize a large area on his stomach. As previously mentioned, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron.  Perform four cauterizations around the navel using a fine pointed cautery iron, and cauterize the area on the buttock above the coccyx with a large cautery, or two smaller ones.
If you see that the dampness is abundant, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the pubic area, and cauterize each flank.  Perhaps add two small cauterizations near the larger one on the stomach.  This is a successful and unfailing treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are composed of thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and the treatment mentioned in the classification was unsuccessful, cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the lumbar spine, slightly below the table, in a triangular shape.
And a cauterization under the navel, about two fingers in size.  If you judge that the patient's stomach is cold and food is not digesting, and you see the face swollen, cauterize the stomach with a large cauterization as described previously, and a cauterization on the liver. And another one on the spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a while, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the cauterization of warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery, which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and press your hand firmly until the cautery reaches the mouth of the blood vessel from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. If a large cauterization is applied to the cotton, it will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula that occurs in the perineum and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure described in its place, and avoids it, he may be cured by cauterization.  If someone has a fistula and it has lasted, discharging pus and corrupt humors, the first thing you should do is to measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine the depth of its penetration with the probe, then heat the cautery, which resembles a stylus, and insert it, hot, into the fistula itself, directly along the path of the fistula's penetration and the depth reached by the probe.  Apply the cautery to it repeatedly, one or two or three times, as needed, until all the corrupt matter is burned.
And be careful not to burn a nerve, if one exists, or a large blood vessel, if the fistula empties into the bladder or the intestines.
And be cautious of all these locations.  Only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area, and you determine it is not penetrative.  Then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals over, the discharge stops, and it remains that way for a while, know that it is completely cured.
If the discharge does not stop, know that it is penetrative, or there is corrupt bone within its depth, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
Concerning the cauterization of the kidney.
If pain occurs in the kidney due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual potency is thereby diminished, it is appropriate to cauterize the loins, over the kidneys themselves, cauterizing each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery described previously.  It may be cauterized a third time on the same area, resulting in three consecutive cauterizations for greater benefit.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot control urination, cauterize the bladder with one cauterization below the navel, where the pubic hair begins, and with another cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
After cauterization on each side, the cauterization should be the size of a thumb's breadth.  A cauterization should be made at the base of the spine, or two if needed. The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of the uterus.
If the uterus contains a substance of cold and moisture, preventing conception, corrupting the menstrual flow, or making it difficult during menstruation, or if pain occurs during menstruation, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as previously described for cauterizing the bladder. One cauterization on the lower back, over the lumbar region, or two, using a nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Forty.
Concerning the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
Erroneous moistures may accumulate in the acetabulum, causing dislocation.  A sign is that one leg is longer than the other when the legs are compared, and a hollow is found at the site of the dislocation.  It is necessary to cauterize the affected area, directly on the acetabulum, with a roughly circular cautery.
After marking the acetabulum with ink, in the same way it would be drawn into the center of a circle, and using the cautery shown in the example of stomach cauterizations; if this cautery is not available, cauterize with three applications of the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep to the full thickness of the skin, and then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-one.
In cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and dampness, and the treatment described in the classification was ineffective and prolonged, it is necessary to thin the thick humors with rotten seeds or prickly pear seeds, and the like.
Then cauterize, and the cauterization has two types: either cauterization with burning medications or cauterization with fire. Cauterization with fire has many types, one of which is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
This produces a beneficial depth, and the space between each cauterization is equal to the thickness of a finger. The cautery is olive-shaped.  A cauterization might also be made in the center, on the head of the hip itself, creating four cauterizations. If desired, cauterize with the circle previously mentioned for hip dislocation, using one cauterization.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh in the location where the patient points to the pain, and one cauterization above the ankle, slightly towards the outer side, using a knife-shaped cautery. The depth of the cauterization should only be the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends toward the toes, cauterize there with a pinpoint cautery three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
Take care in all your cauterizations not to burn a major nerve or artery, lest you cause the patient a grave injury or long-lasting harm.
I have seen one and another who cauterized above the ankle, and overdid the cauterization, causing gangrene of the leg, even reaching the foot, causing it to fester entirely and ruining the whole leg, followed by diarrhea and death afterward.  If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in exactly the same manner.
Some scholars among the wise men have described a hip cauterization using an instrument shaped like a cup, made of iron, with a diameter of half a span.  The rim of this cup is as thick as a date pit, or slightly less.  Within this cup are another cup, and a third.
The space between each cup should be the width of the thumb.  The cups should be open on both sides, and their height should be about one or two thumbs.  A handle of iron is fitted to the cups, and this is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and sparks fly, then placed on the hip joint, the patient resting on the sound side.  Three circular cauterizations are made in one instance.  Then, the patient is left for three days and bandaged with ghee, allowing the wound to remain open for several days.
Then, it is treated with ointment until healed.  The author of this book states that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its severity and frightening appearance, and few can tolerate it.  However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it and who are affected in that location.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is to make two cups like the neck through which the latch of the door descends, made of copper or iron.
They will have a height of about two thumbs, and the space between them will be the thickness of a finger.  The bottoms and tops of the cups will be open, and they will be fastened together in this fashion.
Then, they are placed on the hip joint, the patient lying on their sound side.  Hold your hand gently, and then pour a small amount of hot, sharp water between the circles.  Hold it for about the time of an hourglass. The patient will endure the stinging and burning, as it feels like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the sharp water from the entire hip with fresh water. Then leave it for three days and apply grease to it, until the blackness of the burn disappears. Allow the pus to drain for several days; this will be more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it, to contain water, in the same way you made one for the hip. This is a description of the sharp water, and its efficacy is established in my treatise on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part of potash and one part of quicklime, grind them, and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, just large enough for a rod to enter. Place another glazed pot under the base of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the potash and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth, after firmly pressing them with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drips into the glazed pot below. Collect all this water and pour it over fresh lime and potash.
Then it will be extremely sharp and potent, effective in many medical procedures and cauterizing other parts of the body, because it acts like fire itself.  Some medicines, such as *thāfisīyā*, *balādhur* honey, and lime mixed with soap, can also cauterize the hip.
Galen, quoting an ancient physician, claimed a cure for hip pain and sciatica, greatly praising it and claiming that no other treatment was needed and that it would heal in a single application.
To the point that a person might enter a bath carried and exit cured. This is done by taking fresh, green *shiṭraj*, or if green is unavailable, fresh dry *shiṭraj*.  Grind it with some fat, and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
Then bind it tightly and leave it for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside. Afterward, have him enter a bath.  Once his body is moist, have him enter a basin.  The pain will depart, and he will be healed, God willing. If not, repeat the dressing after ten days.
He will be healed, God willing.  Know that none of these cauterizing medications should be used until the body has emptied itself.  Dioscorides mentioned that goat's dung, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be done like this: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep area between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow. Then take dry goat's dung.
Then ignite it with fire until it becomes ember, place it on the wool, and leave it until it dies out.  Then take another and repeat until the sensation extends from the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing.  This type of cauterization is called cauterization with dung.
Chapter Forty-two.
Concerning cauterization for back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from various causes, such as a fall, blow, excessive vomiting, and similar occurrences.  It may result from the effusion of cold, moist matter.  Cauterization is applied only in this type of case.
In cases of effusion of cold matter, after the patient has vomited, using rotten herbs or similar remedies, one should cauterize the back where the pain is, creating three rows, each the width of a table, after marking the area with ink. In each row, cauterize five or more times, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery. Or, if you prefer, three or four cauterizations with a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter Forty-three.
On cauterizing the initial stage of a swelling.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its initial stage in a child is shortness of breath upon standing and moving.  At the end of the spinal vertebrae, a pearl-like protrusion is found, standing out from the other vertebrae.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this way. Apply the cautery to each side of the vertebra evenly.  If you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery, in two or three rows.  Let the points be close together.  Then treat the area until it is healed as described.
And remember to use cautery on swellings resulting from nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
If joint pain is due to cold dampness affecting any part of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, physicians usually call it gout, specifically.
If the cold gouty cause is treated with the methods we mentioned in the classification and the pain does not subside, then cauterization removes it.  Cauterize the area around the joints of the legs with many cauteries after inducing vomiting. The cautery should be olive-oil based, of medium intensity, in this manner.
And if it requires puncturing the leg, do so with a pointed cautery.  If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, as often happens, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with the same olive oil cautery.
If more cauterization is needed, cauterize, but do not delve deep with the cautery; it should only be about the thickness of the skin. If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods described in that section.
If the pain is only in the hands, puncture around the forearms in a row-like fashion. If the pain remains in the fingers, puncture each joint and the palm of the hand. If, after a few days, the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders,
Cauterize both (elbows/shoulders) on each side.  The patient should not neglect good treatment and taking medications. If the patient improves their diet and expels phlegm, then he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and omentum descend into the testicle, and this is a recent development, the patient should be instructed to abstain from eating that day and to use laxatives to expel feces from his body.
Then, he should lie on his back before you, and you should instruct him to hold himself still until the omentum or intestines protrude.  Then, you should return them with your finger.  Then, mark the area beneath the hernia on the pubic bone with ink, making a mark resembling half a circle, its tips toward the upper part of the body.
Then, heat a cautery iron—this is its form.
Until it becomes white, throwing sparks. Then, return the intestines or omentum to their place. Then, a servant should place his hand over the area to prevent the intestines from protruding again.  His legs should be spread apart, and a cushion should be placed under him. Another servant should hold his legs together.
And another should hold his hands, while you place the cautery iron on the same mark. Your hand holding the cautery iron should be straight and firm, until the cautery reaches the bone, or repeat the procedure if it didn't reach the bone on the first attempt.
Be careful to prevent the intestines from protruding while cauterizing, so that you do not burn him, causing either death or a great calamity. Know that if your cauterization does not reach the bone, your effort will not be successful. The cautery iron should be gentle in proportion to the patient's age, whether child or adult.
Then, treat the cauterized area with ghee after three days, to remove the scorching of the fire, and then treat it with other ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
His food during his treatment should be such as to soften his bowels, to prevent the intestines from protruding during bowel movements.  Then, if he wishes to stand after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  Minimize exertion, and the intake of food, drink, and loud noises.
If he follows this treatment, he will heal completely, God willing.  I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its appropriate section, God willing.  As for hernias occurring in the rest of the abdomen, if you want to prevent them from growing, cauterize a circular area around the hernia, in proportion to its size. The burned skin should be about a third of the hernia's size. Then treat it as described above; it will not increase, God willing. Some earlier physicians have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery iron in this manner.
After marking the hernia with ink, making a line across the upper side of the hernia and another to the lower side, place your hand in the middle to cauterize with a single, nail-like cautery. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in any limb, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time, and treatment with medication is ineffective, then it is necessary to cauterize with a small cautery iron.  The cauterization of each limb should be in accordance with its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula yield to it [the cauterization], then he will be healed from the first cauterization; otherwise, repeat the cauterization, for it is the nature of these pains to spread from the limb to the area near it; therefore, it is necessary to follow it up with cauterization until the patient is cured.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for those with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, observe. If the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it as described in the section on classification, and it has not declined, nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will affect all his humors, cauterize him five times on the head. One in the usual center of the head, the second below it, towards the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one behind, on the occiput.  Employ your cauterizing tool a little more forcefully so that it makes a slight impression on the bone.
Scales will peel off, making it easier for the thick vapors to escape. Also cauterize the spleen with a cauterization as previously described. However, if the leprosy has persisted and become evident on the patient, you should cauterize with the described methods on the head. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tail, another above it in the same region, and two on each thigh, one on each. Two on each knee, one on each, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterize each joint of his fingers and toes, and each heel of his feet and each wrist.
And be cautious of the nerve behind the heels, so as not to burn them.  A cauterization can also be applied to the pubic bone, the stomach opening, and the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations you apply, the more effective and beneficial they will be.
Know that the patient experiences less pain from the cauterization than a healthy person, because their body is numb.  The size of the cauterizing iron should vary according to the affected organs and joints, as described in the properties of the irons.
Then treat the cauterized area with fine crushed carob, honey, and other remedies until it heals, God willing.
The Forty-eighth Chapter.
Concerning cauterizing numbness: When a part of the body has been numb and treated with medications, ointments, and dressings, but still does not heal, cauterize the numb area with cauterizations appropriate to the size of the affected area; make the cauterizations slightly deeper in the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Cauterization can also be used for some numbness that affects the hand or foot in the spinal column's vertebrae at the point where the nerve that moves that limb exits, thereby relieving the numbness.
Only those knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
The Forty-ninth Chapter.
On cauterizing leprosy.
If leprosy persists despite all medical attempts, cauterize it with a slight depth, proportionate to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  orchis root, dove's blood, or the blood of hooked birds, one part of each, mixed together and applied to a cloth, which is then bound to the affected area until it heals.
The Fiftieth Chapter.
On cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, moving in a circle.  Some scholars have suggested a strong cauterization in the center, but I do not favor this, for I anticipate ulceration, and have observed such instances repeatedly.
Therefore, the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many small cauterizations.
The Fifty-first Chapter.
On cauterizing the abscess.
If an abscess has formed and is slow to mature, either because of the agent causing it, or due to the age of the patient, if they are elderly with little blood, or due to time, and you want to hasten the abscess's maturation, cauterize around it with many small, scattered cauterizations.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you wish to cauterize it further, heat the cautery iron, which is depicted in this illustration.
Place it in the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin.  Let the cauterization be from below so that the discharge of pus is easier. Then treat it as appropriate until healed.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On cauterizing the ulcer.
An ulcer is nothing but corruption that spreads in a limb and consumes it, just as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, heat a cautery iron with many small and large nails, according to what is appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all corruption is eradicated and nothing remains.  Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all scabs and all corruption are removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments that promote flesh growth. If you see after three days that the flesh grows healthily without corruption, then leave it be. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupt areas.  The ulcer may also be treated with a strong medicine.
For it (the strong medicine) is quicker in its benefit than fire.  I have mentioned its treatment with strong medicine in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a rough and painful condition, often occurs on the soles of the feet.  Cauterization for it can be done in two ways: either by fire or by strong water.
As for cauterization by fire, one must heat a hollowed-out iron cautery, resembling an eagle's beak, to a size that encompasses the nail on all sides. Its edges should be thin.  Then, bring it down onto the nail, and rotate it around the nail until it reaches the nail's depth.
Leave it for three days, allowing pus to form.  Then, dress it with ground wild basil mixed with salt, leaving the dressing on for a night.  It will then detach from its roots.  The wound site should then be treated with a flesh-producing ointment until it heals.  This applies for non-inverted nails.
This often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  One should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's beak, and place it on the nail or wart.  Then, pour a small amount of strong water into the tube.
Hold the tube while rotating it, gently pricking the skin to allow the tube's edge to reach the nail's base.  The strong water should penetrate to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging sensation of the strong water for a little while.
Then leave it; the nail will detach at its roots.  Do this to each one until you have treated all of them on the body.  Then, treat the areas after their detachment with flesh-producing ointments.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
In the treatment of the scabies.
If someone is affected by scabies from cold, or fever, or other such causes, then it is necessary to cauterize them four or five times on the back, with a cauterization between each spot on the back, and also one on the chest. And on their stomach, cauterize with an olive oil cautery, as this will ease the scabies and quickly ripen the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
In the cauterization of a wound that has occurred on the body.
Ugly boils may appear on the body, caused by thick, corrupt, cold materials.  At their first appearance, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil, using a stick whose end has been ignited by fire, or with a long zeraound stem, or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And carbuncles, in their initial eruption, should be cauterized in this manner.  Thus, the causative agent will not increase and will dissipate, and the patient will recover, but this should only occur after the patient has been bled by venesection.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
In the cauterization of bleeding occurring when an artery is cut.
Bleeding often occurs from an artery severed by an external wound, or when a tumor or a body part is incised or cauterized, and similar instances, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly apply your index finger to the mouth of the artery and press firmly until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing more comes out. Then, place several small and large olive-wood cauteries in the fire, and blow on them until they are extremely hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has ruptured, and apply the cauterizing iron to the same vein after quickly removing your finger. Hold the cauterizing iron until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding resumes when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cauterizing iron cools, quickly take another cauterizing iron from the prepared fire and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be cautious, so you do not burn a nerve, for this would cause another affliction to the patient. Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be cut, especially if it is large, except by one of four means: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation, if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; or it may be tied with strong threads; or the medications that will stop the bleeding and firmly compress the area may be applied.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a ligature, or by compressing with cloth, or by applying burning substances, and the like, it will not stop in that way, except rarely.  If one experiences this and there is no physician or medicine available, they should immediately place their index finger over the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should press firmly until the blood is contained and flows out above the wound and onto the artery and finger.  The finger must remain on the wound continuously, applying very cold water, until the blood solidifies, thickens, and stops.  During this time, one should consider what cauterization or medication is required.
The second chapter.
On incision, cupping, bloodletting, and other surgical procedures.
Khalaf said: We have previously mentioned in the first chapter all illnesses in which cauterization by fire and burning medicines are suitable, their causes, reasons, and instruments, as well as the various types of cauterization.  We have organized this into chapters, from the neck to the feet.
And I will follow the same approach in this chapter so that the student can easily achieve their goal.
Before I begin, you children should know that this chapter contains more uncertainty than the first chapter on cauterization.
Therefore, the warnings must be stronger, for in this chapter, the practitioner frequently depletes the vital blood when opening a vein or incising a tumor, cupping an abscess, treating a surgical wound, extracting an arrow, or incising a stone, and similar procedures. All of these are fraught with danger and fear, and death often results.
I advise you to avoid anything questionable, for in this practice, you will encounter diverse patients with various illnesses.  Some may be weary of their illness and find death preferable.
Because of the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, some exhibit symptoms that indicate death. Others offer you their wealth, hoping for recovery, but their illness is fatal.  You should not take any help from those who are in this condition.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness.  Do not undertake anything without certain knowledge of the likely outcome.  In all your treatment of patients, employ thorough knowledge and warn them of the possible consequences for their well-being.
For in this, you will gain praise, glory, and renown. May God inspire you, my children, with wisdom, and keep you from error and misfortune.  For all this is in His power.  There is no god but Him.
I have arranged this chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cauterization, from the crown to the feet, so that you may find what you need more easily, God willing.
The First Chapter.
On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of young children.
This affliction often occurs in infants at birth if the midwife applies pressure to the infant's head without gentleness.  It may also arise from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have seen this affliction only in infants, and all those I have seen have died quickly.  Therefore, I have found it best to avoid treatment. I have seen an infant whose head filled with water and whose head grew larger each day. Until the infant could no longer sit up because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone, or beneath the bone on the peritoneum.  If the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then a single, horizontal incision should be made in the middle of the head, about two fingers in length, to allow the moisture to drain.  This is the image of the lancet.
If the moisture is more extensive and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions in this manner.
If the moisture is beneath the bone, and the sign is that the sutures of the head are open on all sides, and the water flows inward when pressed with your hand, this is not unknown to you; then three incisions should be made in the middle of the head, in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture will drain. Then the incisions should be bound with cloth and bandages.  Then apply dressings of herbs and oil from above, until the fifth day. Then, the bandages should be loosened, and the wound treated with ointments and compresses.  Maintain moderate head support.  The patient should be nourished with all dry foods, low in moisture.
Until the limb strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is to observe where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water appear, as it may be more prominent in the back of the head, or the front, or the right, or the left.
Aim the incision where the swelling and the accumulation of water appear to you; incise it as best you can, taking care not to cut a blood vessel, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding, while expelling the moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Severing the two arteries behind the ears, known as the *hassisin*.
When someone suffers a severe affliction of the eyes or chest, and prolonged treatment with medication proves ineffective, the best treatment in such cases is to sever these two arteries.
Therefore, if you wish to sever them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery, then tighten the patient's neck using the patient's own clothes, then look for where the veins pulse, and their two locations, the two sunken spots behind the ears.  It is rare that they are hidden, except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a dissecting scalpel, severing them to the bone.  This should be done with the head facing you. If you wish, insert the scalpel beneath the artery and cut it upwards.  The length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
If the artery is severed, the blood will flow out with a pulsating, forward, and continuous stream.  If the artery is not visible, then one should estimate a distance of approximately three fingers from the ear, mark it with ink, and cut to the bone.  What is necessary to...
Approximately six ounces of blood will be released immediately; sometimes more or less, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries. Then, examine the wound. If any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, sever it.
So that an inflammatory swelling does not arise, then bandage the wound with a linen bandage and treat with ointments until healed.
Chapter Three.
On the vessels of the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic headaches or acute illnesses caused by sharp humidity and heat in the muscles of the temples, or from severe chronic headaches, and other similar conditions, and various medical treatments have been ineffective, then we have tried in these illnesses to cauterize or dissect the vessels of the temples, as described.
The method for dissecting them is that the patient should shave the hair of the temples, and locate the visible artery of the temple; its pulsation will make it clear, and it is rarely hidden, except in some individuals.
Or, if it is obscured by the cold, the patient should tighten his neck with his clothing. Then, you should rub the area with a cloth or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the scalpel that has this image. Then, gently dissect the skin with the scalpel until you reach the artery. Then, insert a forceps and pull it upwards until you extract it from the skin and remove any membranes underneath from all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the forceps. Then, cut a portion of it, long enough to separate its ends and contract it, without causing bleeding.  If it is not severed and cut, the blood will not recede.  Then, empty from six to three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with strong, doubled thread, either silk or bowstring, so that putrefaction does not quickly affect the wound before it heals, causing bleeding.
Then, cut off the excess between the ligatures. Do this at that moment or after a different time. If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a scalpel-like cauterizing iron, so that its ends are severed. This fulfills the same action, or is even better, as we said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a heated temperament, cauterization is beneficial for eliminating moisture, and thus is more effective.  After dissecting the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton, and firm dressings should be applied.  After healing, it should be treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth and with compresses until healed, God willing.
If bleeding occurs from the artery during your procedure, immediately stop it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with alum and holding your hand firmly until the bleeding stops. If you lack any of these, place your finger on it to clot the blood.
Apply very cold water to the area until the inflammation subsides and it tightens as it should.  An easier and less difficult method than dissecting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cauterizing iron after marking the two locations with ink.
Apply it very hot, until it reaches the bone, and sever the vein at two points so the distance between the ends is increased; it will never adhere together with this cauterization. This is the image of the cauterizing iron.
It has two sharp blades, resembling small razors, but much less sharp than a knife. If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them quickly and the flesh would not detach quickly.  If they have some thickness, the fire's heat is contained.
Cutting the flesh quickly, this method is better than any other, easier and simpler. Let the distance between the blades be the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
For treating the constant, hot tearing of the eyes.
If the tears are constant, and flowing from the veins on the skull from the outside, and no medical treatment with drugs is effective, and you see the patient's face has become red. He feels a crawling sensation in his forehead, like ants crawling, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their edges eroded and their eyelids stuck together by the intensity of the tears.  The ancients, in treating this, resorted to this procedure, calling it treatment by the sword:  ordering the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made in the forehead, along the length of the forehead. Each incision is about two fingers long, parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly offset from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the opposite side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries on either side, and keep your hand away from the contact between the jaws. After each incision, there should be a space of approximately three fingers clenched together. Have with you prepared sponges or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then, introduce the sharp, two-pronged scalpel, which is of this form. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, use it to dissect all the skin between the incisions, along with the periosteum on the bone. Then, do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and then remove this scalpel. And introduce into the first incision another instrument, called a one-sided sharp, one-sided smooth, non-sharp knife, which is like this (image).
Place the sharp side of the knife towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas of solidified blood.  Then, place a wick of cotton in each incision and apply a dressing soaked in a mixture of broth and oil, or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling.  On the third day, the ligaments heal.  Use abundant lukewarm water compresses. Then treat with basil ointment, rose oil, and other remedies used for wounds until healed, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In treating tears and discharges from the interior of the head to the eyes.
When someone experiences frequent, severe, persistent discharges, and their eyes appear sunken and small, with diminished vision and ulcerated eyelids, and loss of eyelashes. And there will be a sharp, painful ache deep within the head, accompanied by repeated sneezing.  Know, from these symptoms, that these materials and discharges originate from numerous deep veins.  The best treatment for this is to order the afflicted person to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead.
And there will be a sharp, painful ache deep within the head, accompanied by repeated sneezing.  Know, from these symptoms, that these materials and discharges originate from numerous deep veins.  The best treatment for this is to order the afflicted person to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead. or slightly raise it laterally, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be towards the bone. Keep your hand away from the chewing muscles of the temples, until the bone is exposed and all blood is wiped away with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with used cotton or flax thread, and secure it from above with bandages.  Saturate the bandages with medicine and oil, to prevent inflammation.  Once the inflammation subsides, the bone must be rubbed to stimulate the growth of flesh.
Then treat it with a desiccated preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts  *qalfuniya* (likely a type of resin or gum), preparing an ointment from them, and using it to promote flesh growth in such wounds.
Sixth Chapter.
For the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-metallic stone such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas, kernels, and the like; or a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar.
Or it may be an animal. If a stone or a similar small object that does not grow within the ear falls in, expose the ear to sunlight. If you see the stone, put some violet or scerge oil on it, then try to remove it by moving the head or inducing sneezing with a stick. And plug the nostrils when sneezing happens, after placing a band of lint or wool around the ear and tilting the ear upwards. This treatment often removes it. If not, then try to remove it with a gentle cloth, which has this shape.
If it comes out with the cloth, otherwise, try to remove it with a delicate, slightly bent, blind hook.  If it doesn't come out with that, make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole, gently.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil, so that the wind has no path other than through the tube. Then, pull it out with a strong pull.  This often removes it. If it doesn't come out as described, take a small piece of Nabataean gum or prepared gum used to catch birds, and place it at the end of the tube.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, gently insert it into the ear hole after the ear has dried from moisture. If it doesn't come out with all the methods described, quickly perform the incision before a hot swelling or inflammation occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient from the temples, to the extent of their strength. Then, sit the patient before you and tilt their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the fat in the lowest part of it.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with any tools possible.  Then, quickly stitch the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the object that fell into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, try to remove it using the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, gentle lancet, like this one.
Try to cut that type of fallen grain in the ear with it, but only do this if you are certain that the grain has become moistened by the ear's vapor, until it becomes many small pieces.  Then remove it with a blind probe, a gentle forceps, or by suction.
As we have mentioned, it is easy to remove it.  Regarding water in the ear, the patient should first use a censer to induce sneezing.  They should lie on the ear with water, filling it with some old cotton. If it comes out in this way.
Otherwise, take many small, smooth pebbles, warm them slightly by fire, and have the patient insert one into the ear canal.  The patient should lean on one leg on that side, and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He should continue doing this with pebble after pebble until all the water is removed.  Water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and heating the other end by fire until most of it burns, and then replacing it with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water is removed, or draw it out with a tube, as previously described with the pebbles.  As for removing an animal inside, if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it with what I mentioned in the classification.  As for...
If it is large enough to be felt, try to remove it with lint and tweezers. This is easier than everything else that occurs in the ear.  As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if treatment with what we mentioned in the classification in the chapter on worms has not been successful.
Then you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see any worms, remove them with lint or delicate tweezers. If you do not see any, take a tube—this is its form.
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top. Insert the narrow end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate, then suck forcefully. Do this repeatedly until all the worms are removed. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned to you in the case of the pebble.
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, use the worms that I have mentioned.  The ancients have tested them for killing worms.  You will find that in the chapter on worms.  You will use the applicators to place ointments and medications into the ear.  Here is its picture/form.
As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top.  If you wish, the projectile within the tube can be made of tight copper. Or, if you prefer, take a rod and wrap cotton tightly around one end.
Then put the ointment, or juice, or whatever medicine you want, into the tube and place it in the ear. Then insert the rod with the cotton from above and squeeze it with your hand moderately until the ointment is driven into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels it.
Have the patient be inside, and let whatever you put in the ear be warmed a little in the fire.  Beware that the substance you are dripping in is not too cold or too hot, as the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of ear obstructions.
Some children may be born from their mothers with their ear canals unpierced.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or growing flesh.  This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal and unseen.
Occasionally, it may also appear slightly outside the canal, and be visible.  Obstructions deep within the ear, unseen, are usually more difficult to treat.  Those that are visible should be placed in the sun. And examine it. If you see the obstruction outwardly, then open it with a gentle scalpel. This is its image:
Its tip should have a small, limited protrusion, while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a gentle forceps and carefully cut it away until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient's experience of hearing difficulty, gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum. Then, place a wick into the ear, sized to fit the canal, that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment.  Repeat this for several days until the wound is healed. Alternatively, soak a wick in water and sprinkle powdered alum over it.
Use this. If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another soaked in a preparation of rose oil, so that the hot swelling may subside. Then continue treatment until it is healed.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding described in the section on hæmostasis.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts appearing on the eyelids.
These warts appearing on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  They should be grasped with a forceps or tweezers, and cut off at their roots with a scalpel.  Then, powdered antimony should be applied to the area.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cauterizing iron.  Cauterization after cutting is better.  It often returns if any part of the roots remain.  If cauterized with fire, these roots are burned and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of colds affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling a cold, in its intensity and hardness, often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called "cold," which is the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is protruding on the surface of the eyelid, moving in every direction, the treatment is simple: slit it transversely.
Then gently scrape it away from all sides until it is removed.  Then suspend it with a hook and cut it.  If cutting it is not possible without penetrating the eyelid, that will not harm the patient.  If the slit is large, stitch it together and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, no harm will come to you from it; the ointment will strengthen and heal it. If the cold is leaning towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, suspend the cold with a hook without needing to slit it, and trim it from all sides.
If the eyelid is penetrated during the cutting, no harm will result.  Then wash the eye with salt water after cutting the cold, and treat the area with something that will heal it until the patient is well.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the pimple that appears on the eyelid.
The pimple is a swelling that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid.  It is most common in young children, and it weighs down their eyes, causing them to experience colds in the night and making it difficult for them to look at sunlight. Because tears rush to them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces constantly, and they sleep on them.  Their eyelids under their eyebrows are wet, possibly swollen, and the pimple of the swelling is readily apparent.  When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pimple between them.  The method of treatment is to have the patient rest their head on your lap.
Then, take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick, large enough to encompass the pimple on all sides. Then place it over it and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the pimple into the center of the circle.
Then, with a lancet, make a transverse incision in the middle of that moisture, not larger than an incision made in bloodletting.  As for depth, you should cut through all the skin until you reach the pimple.
In most cases, the pimple emerges from the incision as a white piece of fat.  Grasp it with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, pulling it outwards while rotating your hand in both directions, until it heals.  Be careful not to enlarge the incision, lest the lancet damage the eye.
If the pimple does not appear upon the initial incision, you should slightly enlarge the incision gently until the pimple appears. Then pull it out as described.  Then, dip a cloth in vinegar and water and apply it to the area, binding it firmly. Some people crush salt.
Place it [the salt] in the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture. Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs at the site, treat it with cooling dressings until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On methods of treating eye injuries.
If excess eyelashes grow in the eyelid, beyond the natural eyelid line, and become persistent, they harm the eye and cause various ailments such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and cloudiness and thickening, which can lead to blindness.
Treatment of eye injuries can be approached in four ways: by cauterization with fire, by a strong medicine as previously described in the chapter on cauterization, or by cutting and stitching, or by using a cautery, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it turns, then you should insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pierce the eyelid with the thread above, close to the eyelashes themselves, and pull the thread upward through the eyelid.
Turn it with a rod, then cut the inside of the eyelid, excluding the extra hair, with a sharp lancet from the larger to smaller eyelid, then remove the thread and place a small padding of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then seal the eyelid with medicinal paste.
The shape should resemble a mint leaf, but the shape should be adjusted to the required elevation of the eyelid, as it varies between individuals. Some people may need a certain amount of the eyelid to be cut, corresponding to the degree of eyelid relaxation.
Some need a smaller cut, all depending on the relaxation of the eyelid.  Then, with the lancet, make incisions along the marked lines, starting from the larger to the smaller eyelid.  Each incision should be near the natural eyelashes, about the thickness of a rod.
Then insert a hook into one corner of the skin, and peel away the entire skin.  Then, suture the edges together with a fine wool needle and thread, cleaning away the blood.  Stick any excess threads to the eyebrows with some sticky substance.
If you wish to do it, do it. Otherwise, don't bother.  The sutures and threads remain for about three or four days, then treat it.  If you prefer, leave the wound unsutured and treat it with something that dries and contracts, for the eyelid rises when the wound is closed and joined together.  Suturing is better.
This method of lifting the eyelid, mentioned by the ancients, is laborious for the patient, yet good work with no danger. Another method of lifting the eyelid is to shape the eyelid like a mint leaf, as described. Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, separate or grouped in this manner.
Then cut any excess eyelid with a small pair of scissors, in this manner, making a balanced cut.
If you cannot hold the hooks securely, or if the shape is not correct, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape, insert another thread near the larger eye-lid, and a third thread near the smaller eye-lid.  Gently gather the threads with your fingers. Then lift your hand evenly using these threads.
Lift the entire marked skin, as described.  Then close the wound edges with stitches and treat it until healed. If a hot swelling appears after the cut or incision, soothe the swelling with qirrot and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its edges turn inward.  In this case, the methods mentioned—cutting, stitching, cauterization with fire or with a sharp medicine, and cauterization with fire or sharp medicine—are more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and stitching.  Cutting and stitching are more difficult to perform on these.
Cauterization with reeds is performed in this manner: turn the eyelid over, cut the incision from the inside, as described.  Then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length the same as the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And having nibbled them on both ends where the threads hold, gently gather them onto the remaining eyelid and firmly tighten the reeds on both sides. Leave it for several days.  The tightened skin will die, turn black, and fester.
Until it falls off of its own accord.  If it is slow, nibble it with the shears, then treat it until healed.  When it is joined, the eyelid will rise and the edges will not irritate the eye. This is the shape and size of the reeds, made in this way:
Chapter Twelve.
In removing irritating hair from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a fine, smooth silk thread, then tie the ends in a very gentle knot.  The thread should be about a span in length.
Then, attach another, shorter, thin thread to the needle holder, and tie its ends if desired.  The patient should place their head in your lap, close to the light so the work is clear.  It is precise work. Then, using the needle and needle holder, insert the needle into the root of the extra hair.
And carefully pierce the eyelid until you draw it out from above the natural hair.  Then pull the thread upward towards the needle holder, and remove the hair(s) - one, two, or three at most - from the needle holder.
Then, pull gently until the hair is removed from the eyelid with the needle holder along with the natural hair.  If pulling the needle holder doesn't remove the hair, pull the needle holder downward with the thread you attached to it, so that the needle holder exits the opening from above.
Then reinsert the hair into the needle holder and pull both out through the opening from above, so you see them clearly.  At that point, remove the needle holder and thread, bandage the eye and keep it bandaged for two or three days until the hair is firmly in place and flesh grows around it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer piece of natural hair to help it rise, or leave it until it grows longer and then pull it out.

On treating the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid.
This stye, which is called arnbīya, can be either natural or accidental.  The accidental stye results from the inflammation of a wound, a cut, a burn, or similar causes.
The treatment involves incising the inflammation, separating its edges, and placing a linen thread between them, tying it off until healed.  Avoid using things that dry and constrict.
If you do this, the stye will return worse.  Instead, use things that relax it, like fenugreek, soaked in boiled water with the addition of honey, flaxseed, and a diachylon ointment dissolved with some oils.  Apply it to the thread and use it for treatment.
The key to its treatment is to strive by all means to prevent it from adhering in the same way as before. This method we described is only a part of correcting the stye, not restoring the area to its original condition.
Chapter Fourteen.
On treating styes in the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms from below, is the true stye, and it is either natural or accidental.  The accidental stye arises from a wound, incision, cauterization, or similar causes.
The method is to take a needle with a doubled thread, insert it into the flesh, and pierce it from the left to the right side of the affected area until the thread is on both sides of the flesh.  Then, using the needle, pull the flesh upward and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.  Otherwise, take a probe and place it on the site of the cut. Use it to turn the eyelid and make two cuts on the inside of the eyelid, positioning the ends of the cuts at the corners of the incision you made, until they meet to form an angle. So that when they meet, its shape will resemble this form.
Then, remove the flesh as much as the sharp side of it is below the eyelid, then stitch the separated parts together with two stitches of wool thread.  Then treat it with the relaxing and softening medications as mentioned previously, until it heals.
If the ulcer has occurred from a cut, suture, or cauterization, a small incision should be made, also without the eyelashes, as previously described. Then separate the lips with a poultice, as mentioned before.
In short, in treating an ulcer, whether from above or below, perform the procedure according to the appearance of the ulcer, for its form can vary greatly. The skilled surgeon employs whatever method is possible.
Until the shape returns to, or approximates, its natural form. The disease itself indicates the appropriate treatment and tools in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion can affect many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, hindering its movement and normal function.  A slender instrument should then be inserted under the eyelid.
Raise it upwards or extend it with a hook, then sever the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as ordinary scalpel blades, but rather somewhat blunt, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slip, injuring the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be as if you are peeling away the adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the entire adhesion heals.  Then instill saline into the eye, wash it with it, or instill a solution of al-zangari (possibly a specific type of copper sulfate) in water through a dropper.  Then separate the eyelid and the eye with a linen thread.
Place moistened egg white over the eye.  After three days, use astringent eye drops until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the nail and deep flesh growths.
The nail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a tough, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a hard, white moisture; if touched by iron or attempted to be grasped by tongs, it breaks.
A tongs will not hold it. Both types, beginning from the largest part, gradually spread until they cover the eye and obstruct light and movement.  The procedure for cutting it involves the patient resting their head on a cushion.
Then, open their eyes and raise the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with a slightly bent tongs and pull it upwards.  Next, take a needle, thread a horse or cow hair and strong thread through it, slightly bend the tip of the needle, and pierce the nail's center.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the nail to the thread, pull it upwards, and peel the side of the nail next to the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it to the end. Then, cut the remaining part at the root of the growth with a delicate scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the growth.
So that cutting it will not cause constant weeping.  The nail may be pulled out with the tongs alone, or with the thread, as we said, and then the smooth scalpel peels the part that looks like this:.
Care must be taken that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a rupture in the pupil.  After the cut, place some powdered salt or green vitriol in the eye and leave it for another day. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure tongs, this type of nail is often treated with medication and heals as described in the section.  If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, and blunt scalpel, shaped like this:. Peel the nail gently from above with this scalpel. If you see that it is crumbling and only the peeling has affected it, place a drop of green vitriol, red vitriol, or powdered salt into the eye and compress the eye for a day.
Then continue the procedure until all of it is gone, unless a hot tumor appears in the eye. Leave it, and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then resume the peeling until the nail heals.  And as for the fleshy protrusions...
If the protrusion is causing excessive pain to the eye, grasp it with the forceps and remove some of it.  Do not cut too deeply to avoid tearing.  Then apply a drop of red or green vitriol to the depths until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the fleshy growths and excess flesh in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, piled-up flesh may grow to cover the pupil or nearly cover it, or even spill over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids may turn outward, resembling a rose.
The procedure is to have the patient place their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and carefully remove all the red flesh with suitable forceps.
Or grasp it with a scalpel or a spatula, then cut the flesh piece by piece until it is all removed, and protect the eye from harm during the procedure.  The cutting should be done either with the scalpel that we have described for cutting the nail or with small scissors. Like the way you would remove thorns, as its image will appear in the following chapter.
If the cutting is complete and all the flesh is gone, fill the eye with pounded salt or drop into it red or similar corrosive medicines, and apply a white of egg bandage externally to control the inflammation.
If any flesh remains, and blood flows and you fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it to ease the inflammation, then return to the procedure until it heals.  Similarly, treat any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by nature or by appearance with surgery or by using a sharp object, and do not insert your hand in any of these procedures until you see that the organ is capable of tolerating the action.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the Extraction of Objects from the Eye.
The threads are red blood vessels woven over the eye, hindering its vision and weakening the eye over time.  Therefore, first you must observe; if the eye containing the threads is strong, and has no other ailment besides the threads...
Then, the extraction involves instructing the patient to place their head on your lap.  Then, using one or two fine, flexible hooks, you should carefully grasp the threads.  (The illustration then shows the method).
Or, two hooks joined together as shown in this image.
Then, gently extract the threads with a fine pair of scissors, wiping away the blood occasionally until you see the eye clear of the threads and the bleeding has stopped.  Carefully avoid injuring the eye with the scissors' blades.  Work in the afternoon sun.
Be very careful in your work to avoid cutting anything other than the threads.  When you are finished, instill green or red ophthalmic drops into the eye to further consume any remaining threads.  If you are unable to remove them all at that time, bandage the eye to relieve its pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and any inflammation disappears.  Then, repeat the procedure exactly as described until the eye heals.  This is the image of the scissors' care of the eye.
And leave it [and let the patient's head rest in the student's lap, and another student wipe away tears and examine the front and back of the eye]. The proper procedure is to open the eye with fixed or triangular instruments that a student holds.
Look closely, and let the patient's head rest in the student's lap, while another student wipes away tears and examines the front and back of the eye.  You have the choice of starting to extract threads from the top or bottom of the eye; however, it is better to remove two threads from the upper part, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at the beginning.
Hold it between the middle and index fingers, then attach hooks underneath, opposite them. Then, hold it between the ring and little fingers, and gently remove your hand so that you see all the threads have risen.  Cut them off with small scissors, or with a gentle scalpel if you wish.
Insert a needle and thread through all the threads until they rise above the membrane. Do not cut the threads while they are still damp, for tears and blood will run onto you.
Then, cut with scissors any threads extending above and below the eyebrow, so that only those within the cornea remain taut. If you can lift them from the cornea, do so with the needle and thread; this is better, and it might be possible in some cases.
If you cut them, the area will be painful for a few days, but it will subside and the inflammation will be relieved.  Then, resume treatment.
Chapter Nineteen.
In replacing the nasal septum.
Doctors call the septum a "nasoor" if, having treated it with cauterization or caustic medication as previously described, it does not heal.  Then, the only recourse is to incise the tumor when it is ripe and to remove all moisture or pus from it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness on it, scrape it with an instrument of this form:
This is called a "coarse-headed" instrument.  It is made of Indian iron, and its head is round like a button.  It is engraved with a fine carving, like a file or a scalpel.  Place it on the area of corruption in the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly squeezing your hand, until you know that the corruption has been removed.
And do this several times, then bind the area with drying, astringent medicines.  If the area is sealed, flesh grows there, the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, discharge, or incident.
Then know that it has healed.  Otherwise, there is no other recourse but to return the nasoor to the nasal opening in this manner: expose the bone again with iron or a caustic agent.  Once the bone is exposed, take a probe of this form:
The tip of the iron is triangular, and its shaft tapers to a point, as you see.  Place it on the bone itself, near the orifice, and keep your hand a little further from the eye.  Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
By feeling the air escaping from it when the hand is held on the nose.  Then, bind the area with drying, astringent medicines, as I have instructed you. If flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter which was projecting outward will return to the nose, making it easier on the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On returning the protruding eye.
If the entire eye protrudes, and there is no damage or deficiency in vision, then the patient should be eased, then straightened in the cranium.  Then, place a cupping glass on the back of the head without conditions, and gently cup.
Then place on the eye a compress made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and cypress.  Then the eye is bandaged from above with many layers of fabric; the description of the layers is that you take many soft bandages, folding each piece into four layers, making many.
Then place them one upon the other as needed by the eye, then firmly bandage them with a strong bandage.  Replace the cupping glass for gentle suction without conditions.  Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for one day and one night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be tightened again.  Then remove the bandage after one day and one night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, then do so; otherwise, repeat the bandage, layers, tightening, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the section on cutting the tunica.
If a rupture occurs in the tunica, and it protrudes outside the eyelids like a visible tunica, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to cut it, the procedure is as described.
To do this, insert a needle into the base of the tunica from below to above, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the medial side, penetrating it, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then cut the point where the doubled thread bends, and tie some of the tunica around the needle and tighten it firmly.  Then remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white to the eye, allowing the threads and tunica to fall away.  Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  The tunica may be tightened from all sides with a circular piece of cloth until the eye is drawn firmly.  Then, a thin scalpel is used to reach the depths of the eye, drawing out the white moisture and causing the eye to droop and dry out.  Then, tightening it further, until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
Concerning the treatment of the abscess.
This ailment, called an abscess, is a collection within the eye, resembling falling water but without it.  The treatment involves having the patient sit upright on a chair, and then using both hands to grasp their head at both sides.
And move it, so that you can see the collection moving downwards.  Then, hold it still; it will not move.  The light will be released, and the patient will see objects as they used to.  If it does not descend, we know it is water. If the collection does not descend as described,
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you.  Then, take a thin scalpel and make a small incision just above the corneal membrane, where the diseased tissue joins the cornea at the limbus, so as to remove the matter.
Then, after the matter is removed, instill warm water into the eye, which may have been mixed with honey or water with boiled licorice and honey. Then, continue treatment in other ways until the patient recovers.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already described the types of water in our classification, and which are suitable for instillation, in an extensive and explanatory manner.  Take this information from there for accuracy.  Then, the patient should be seated before you, squatting in front of a light source, near the sun.
Tie and firmly hold the healthy eye, then raise the eyelid with your left hand if the watery eye is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cup near the limbus, with a thickness like a date stone, on the white part of the eye near the smaller angle, and push the cup forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the cup has reached an empty space.
The depth to which the cup should penetrate should be equal to the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris (limbus of the eye).  The copper will be visible to the observer, through the clarity of the cornea, in the same way as the eye sees. Then, raise the cup to the location of the water.
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the water descends immediately, the patient will see what was previously hidden to his sight, the cup inside his eye.  Then allow a brief rest. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the cup.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cup gently, rotating your hand slightly.  Then dissolve a little pure, finely ground rock salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then apply a moistened compress or wool to the entire outside of the eye.
Apply rosewater and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye. As for us and those of our time, we use pounded cumin mixed with egg white.  If the cup does not enter the eye due to its hardness (some people have very hard eyes). One should take the lancet called the *bidr*, which is of this shape/form.
Pierce only the affected part with it, do not excessively enlarge the hole.  Rather, lightly pierce the area around the cup. Then insert the cup as previously described. Once completed, prepare a firm, dark bed for the patient to lie on his back.
He must refrain from all movement and coughing.  His diet should be something that softens his nature, and he should not move his head right or left at all. Keep the bandage in place for three days.  Then remove it in the same dark room and test his eyesight.
Show him objects, then replace the bandage for seven days.  Do not do this during the treatment or after the cup is applied at your time, but rather, refrain from it before the water rises quickly due to intense observation.
If a hot swelling appears, then the eye should be unbandaged before the seventh day and treated with something that relieves the swelling. Once it subsides, the patient's vision should be released. Place a cloth over his face so he trains his vision from beneath it for several days in the dark room.  Then...
He emerges from the room gradually and attends to his affairs.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the cup repeatedly before proceeding with the work.  I have heard some Iraqis claim that they make a hollowed-out cup in Iraq that sucks up water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor have I read of it in any book of the ancients. It may be a recent innovation.  Here is an illustration of various types of cups, so he may understand them due to their lack of familiarity.
They are made of copper, especially, and their tip has precisely this fineness, a triangular, sharp point.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
Concerning the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous fleshy growths may develop in the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs, others cancerous, hard, and dark-colored, and still others soft and not dark-colored.
If these growths are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, open their nostril, insert the forceps into the flesh, pull it out, and then cut off what has been grasped with a gentle, sharp scalpel, from a single side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone. If any remains that you cannot cut off, peel it away with one of the gentler instruments gently, so that nothing remains. If blood abounds or a hot swelling appears.
If it was a malignant tumor, then promptly cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh disappears. Then, after cutting, apply vinegar and water or a drink to the nose, so that the nose opens and moisture drains into the throat.
Then know that he is healed. If the moisture does not drain properly, know that there is a growing flesh inside the porous bones, which the instrument has not reached with the cutting. In that case, you should take a thread of thick linen.
Tie many knots in it, making each knot the size of a finger or smaller.  The patient should manipulate the end of the thread into their nose using a probe or whatever means possible, making it like a button, and pull it gently until it reaches the nostrils.
It will emerge at his throat.  Children often do a similar action in schools. This is an easy procedure for those who want to do it.  Then, gather the two ends of the thread—the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to dissect the flesh, continuing until you know that the flesh has been severed by the knots. Then remove the thread.  Place the thread in the nose, after wiping away the blood, and treat it with an Egyptian salve. Do this for three days or more.
Until the salve eats away any remaining flesh.  Then, finally, a lead tube is placed in the nose for several days until healed.  If further drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is an image of the instrument used to instill ointments and medicines into the nose.
A small, open, ointment-containing lamp-like device, made of silver or brass, is used.  Its channel is also open.
If you wish, you can make the tube closed, like a reed, and the applicator's ointment container flat.
It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold it when heating ointments or other liquid substances in it.
Chapter Twenty-five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing in size and number over time until their appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and completely remove it. Then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine in place of cauterization to the area.  If you delay cutting it off until it grows large, then if it is hard, stony, dark-colored, and insensitive, look into it further.
Do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen that cutting this tumor has resulted in great harm for its sufferer. If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that cutting all of it is possible, then... Exhauste the patient and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the area with what dries and contracts until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is separated by a wound or similar, know that if a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, action is rarely successful, except in some individuals.
Therefore, if any of this occurs, examine if the wound is fresh with blood. If so, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and then treat it until healed. If the separated connection has separated its edges, and each section is sound, then it is necessary to remove the skin of each section, down to the visible layer until it bleeds.
Then bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and dust them with powdered alum and frankincense. Place a plaster of palm ointment or other adhesive ointment on top. Leave it tightened for two or three days, then remove it.
Then change the medicine and leave it until the stitches come out by themselves. Then treat it with the ointment until healed. The method of suturing is to bring the separated connection together, either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as I explained to you there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling carbuncles, others smaller or larger.  It is necessary to turn back the lip, and incise each knot, and remove it with forceps.
Cut it from all sides, then fill the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops.  Then rinse with vinegar and salt. Treat the affected areas with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting excess flesh from the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called *apulos*.  It should be grasped with forceps or a dissector, cut at its base, and allowed to bleed. Then, powdered alum should be placed on the area.
Or one of the astringent, dried powders. If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does; cut it again and cauterize it, as it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cleaning the teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and out, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, and this decay may reach the gums, making the teeth unsightly.
The patient should be seated before you, head resting on your lap.  Clean the tooth or teeth showing scales and sand-like material thoroughly until none remains.  Likewise, remove any black, green, or yellow discolorations, and clean completely.
If the initial cleaning is successful, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the cleaning process on the following day, and again on the third, until the desired result is achieved.  Be aware that different shaped tools are needed for cleaning teeth, depending on the task.
For the instruments used to clean inside the teeth are different from those used to clean outside the teeth, and those used to clean between the teeth are different yet.  These various instruments should be readily available.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should attempt all possible remedies for toothache before resorting to extraction, for there is no substitute for a tooth once removed, as it is a precious substance; therefore, extraction should only be considered as a last resort.
Therefore, if the patient insists on extraction, ensure that the toothache is completely resolved. Often, the patient deceives himself regarding the location of the pain, believing it to be in a healthy tooth, and extracts it.  Then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have witnessed this repeatedly in the actions of blood-letters.
If the source of the toothache is definitively identified, one should then use a strong scalpel to cut around the tooth, loosening the gum tissue on all sides.  Then, one should move the tooth, little by little, first with the fingers, or with delicate forceps, until it begins to loosen.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with the large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees to ensure stability, and pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it doesn't come out, take one of the tools mentioned, gently insert it under the tooth from all sides, and move it as you did before.
If the tooth is carious or decayed, you should fill the cavity with a cloth and seal it tightly with a thin, pliable material to prevent it from splintering when you use forceps to pull it.  You should meticulously cut around the gum tissue on all sides.
Use caution to avoid breaking the tooth, as fragments left behind can become a greater affliction for the patient than the initial pain.  Beware of the actions of unskilled blood-letters, who attempt tooth extraction without using the methods we have described.
They often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots entirely or partially embedded. Or, the extraction might pull out parts of the jawbone, as we have seen repeatedly.  After extraction, the patient should rinse the area with a liquid such as vinegar and salt.  If bleeding occurs, which is common, powder some alum and apply it to the area.
If alum is ineffective, then use the delicate forceps, which initially move the tooth.  The forceps should have long tips and a short, thick handle to avoid bending when grasping the tooth.  This is a depiction of the larger forceps.
The handles should be thick, so that when you grasp them they do not yield or bend. The tips should be short.  They should be made of Indian iron or tempered steel, with the tips sharply pointed and interlocked, providing a strong and secure grip.
The tips can also be shaped like a file, making them extra strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On extracting tooth roots and removing fractured jawbones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root has broken off, you should apply a piece of cloth soaked in oil to the area for a day or two to allow it to relax, then insert the forceps or pliers. Which resemble the beak of the bird called the blerja, and this is an image of the pliers.
If it has been made like a file inside or like a scraper, and if it does not come out with these pliers, then you should drill at the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, of which this is a picture.
Short at the end, slightly thick, and should not be pointed so as not to break; if the root comes out with this, otherwise use these other tools, of which this is an image; the first one is triangular at the end with some thickness.
Another delicate triangular image.
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, of which this is also a picture.
And with other tools and instruments that have been previously mentioned in the inventory of the teeth, and we may also use this instrument that resembles a large hook, of which this is a picture.
Triangular, curved end, with some slight thickness so as not to break; and let it not be pointed; and know that instruments for the teeth are numerous, and so are all the other instruments; and the skillful artisan in his craft may invent tools for himself according to what is indicated by the work and the diseases themselves.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not describe instruments, due to the variety of their types; if a bone of the jaw or of one of the bones of the mouth breaks or becomes putrid, search for it in its place with what is suitable from one of these instruments and forceps that were mentioned for the removal of roots.
And we use a file, of which this is its image.
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is extracted, and we treat the area with suitable medications. If the bone has a slight putrefaction, clean it of its putridity and blackness until it is cleansed, then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter Thirty-two.
In the eruption of teeth growing over others.
Teeth that erupt outside their natural course disfigure the appearance, especially in women and slaves.  Therefore, one should examine if the tooth has erupted behind another tooth.
If it cannot be moved or extracted, remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it off with this instrument, which has this image/form.
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp Indian steel.  Cut it over many days, due to the tooth's hardness and to avoid disturbing other teeth.  If it is projecting and firmly placed, cool it with an Indian file, which has this image/form.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with very fine carvings, like the file used for making needles.  Cool the tooth little by little over many days, gently, so as not to dislodge and cause it to fall.  Then, smooth it afterwards and pare it with various paring tools.
And if a tooth has broken off part of itself, causing pain to the tongue when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the fracture disappears, it becomes smooth and even, causing no harm to the tongue and not impairing speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On fastening loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If old teeth become loose and displaced due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat anything because of fear of loss, and if treatment with astringent medications has been ineffective.
The remedy is to tie them with gold or silver thread, gold being preferable because silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, whereas gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, appropriate for the space between the teeth.
The method of fastening is to take the thread, pass its bend between the two sound teeth, and then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until the weaving reaches the sound tooth on the other side.
Then, weave back to the starting point, applying gentle and skillful pressure so as not to dislodge the teeth.  Tighten the thread at the tooth roots to prevent loosening, and then cut the excess thread ends with scissors.  Gather and twist the ends together with the floss, hiding them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
To prevent injuring the tongue. Then leave it tightened like this for as long as it remains.  If it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread.  In this way, the patient will enjoy the teeth for the rest of their life.  This is the manner and method of fastening two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single or two teeth may be repositioned and fastened as described, remaining in place.  This is performed by a skilled dentist.  Sometimes, a skilled artisan will carve bone from an ox and fashion it into the shape of a tooth, placing it in the socket from which the tooth has been lost. And it is tightened, as we said, to remain in place.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On severing the ligament that lies under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament under the tongue may be either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, place their head on your lap, lift their tongue, and then sever the nerve ligament transversely so that the tongue is freed. If the ligament is somewhat firm and knotted, as might be from a healed wound, then insert a probe and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is loosened.
Beware of making the cut too deep into the flesh, as this could sever an artery and cause bleeding. Afterward, the patient should gargle with rosewater or a mixture of vinegar and cold water. Then place a linen wick under the tongue, which the patient should hold in place each night.
To prevent re-adhesion. If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area. If the bleeding is severe, cauterize the area with a suitable, lens-shaped cautery iron. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-five.
Removing the toad that has developed under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small toad may form under the tongue, hindering its normal function, and sometimes growing to fill the mouth.  To treat it, the patient's mouth is opened in front of the sun, and the tumor is examined.
If it appears dark or black, hard, and insensitive to the patient, do not attempt to treat it, for it is cancer.  If it leans towards a whitish color with moisture, use a probe to pierce it, and carefully slice it open with a scalpel, and remove it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during the procedure, apply powdered alum until it stops, then continue the procedure until the tumor is completely removed.  Afterwards, the patient should gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any tumors that grow in the throat may present glands inside the throat resembling those appearing externally, called tonsils. If these are treated as described in the section but do not heal, ...
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use the iron on it.  If it is red and thick-rooted, also do not use iron for fear of blood loss.  Instead, let it mature, either by poulticing or by spontaneous rupture.
If it is white, round, and thin-rooted, this is the one that should be cut. Before doing so, observe if its inflammatory swelling has completely subsided or has lessened somewhat.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, with their head resting on your lap, and their mouth open.  Take an assistant, and have them hold the patient's tongue down with an instrument shaped like this:
Make it of silver or bronze, thin like a knife.  Once the tongue is held down and the tumor is clearly visible, take a probe and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes along with it.
Then cut it with an instrument, shaped like scissors, but with the tips curved, each tip sharp at the other, made of Indian iron or Damascene steel.
If this instrument is unavailable, then cut it with a scalpel,  like this:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or rue leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled, until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals.  Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut these as described for cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman whose throat tumor, resembling a small lump, almost completely blocked her throat.  She could only breathe through a narrow passage and could not eat or drink.
She was close to death if she had lived another day or two. Two branches had grown from the tumor and protruded out of her nostrils. I quickly inserted a hook into one and pulled it out. A piece was detached.
Then I cut it where I could reach it from the nostril.  I did the same with the other protruding part.  Then I opened her mouth, pressed her tongue down, and inserted the hook into the tumor itself.  I cut off some of it and only a little blood came out.
The woman's throat opened up, and she immediately began drinking water and eating.  We repeatedly cut away from that tumor over a long period, and it kept growing back.  This went on for a long time for both of us.
I cauterized the tumor inside her throat, which stopped it from growing further.  Then I left, and I do not know what happened to her after I left.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
In cutting a tumor of the larynx.
If a tumor descends to the larynx, and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called a column.  If it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called an uva.  If treated with what we have described in the classification, and the treatment is unsuccessful.
If a hot tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be cut.  If it is a mass that is round and has no length, and is reddish, or the color of blood, or dark, or does not cause sensation, it should not be cut.
In this, there is danger for the patient.  Therefore, if you see it with the characteristics we mentioned, of whiteness and length, the patient should sit facing the sun, press their tongue with the instrument whose description was previously given, then insert the snare into the uva.
Pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.  Only that which exceeds the natural measure should be cut, and no more, for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after the cut, use what we described in the cutting of the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient hesitates to have it cut, use the cauterization method without fear or caution.  The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then, press the patient's tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with quicklime that is not extinguished, and make it neither thick nor thin. Fill the concavity of this instrument with it.  This is its form/image:.
Its end, where you place the medicine, should have a concavity like the concavity of a marble spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself. The patient should be lying on their side so that saliva flows from their mouth from the inside of their throat, to prevent anything from descending into their throat and harming them.
Then hold the medicine in your hand, pressing it against the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided.  If you wish, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a marble spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the marble spoon with the cotton into the tube from above, so that the cotton adheres to the uvula.  Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to repeat the application of the medicine, repeat it.
After the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee, and remove any remaining medicine from the surrounding area.  Then, rinse with cool water, and treat externally with ointments and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and less frightening.
The uvula can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization or cutting, using incense in this manner:  Take frankincense, saffron, sage, wormwood, chiretta, chamomile, and henna, or similar herbs, gathering them all or some of them in a pot and submerging them in vinegar.
Bring it to a boil, with the pot covered in earthenware.  A small hole is created in the center of the lid, through which a hollow device, crafted from silver or copper, is fitted.
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula through the tube, causing the uvula to contract. Repeat this several times until it withers.  Avoid using this treatment during the initial stages of the swelling.
For it often aggravates the swelling. Instead, it should be performed when the heat of the swelling subsides.  If this device is unavailable, take a reed and fit a hard-boiled egg shell to its end to prevent burning the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth.  This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other foreign objects from the throat.
Thorns, fish bones, or other objects frequently lodge in the throat.  One should remove any visible ones with the aid of an instrument, pressing the tongue down with it, under the light of the sun.
To reveal what is in the throat.  If something is not visible and hidden in the throat, the patient should induce vomiting before their food has digested in the stomach.  Perhaps the foreign object will be expelled by vomiting, or the patient will swallow a piece of linen or a piece of lettuce.
Or, the patient might swallow a piece of dry bread, or a soft piece of sea sponge is tied to a thread and swallowed.  When it reaches the thorn, quickly pull the thread repeatedly.
Often, the thorn or bone adheres to it and is removed.  If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, use a lead instrument like this one:
It is slightly thicker than a stylus.  At its tip, there is a bend. The patient, with their head raised, gently inserts it into their throat, avoiding touching their larynx to prevent coughing.  This pushes the bone or thorn out.  Or the physician inserts it with their hand.
The patient's insertion is better, as they know the location of the foreign object.  Pushing it down or pulling up with the instrument, all this is done as much as possible until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If treatment with the medications described in the previous section proves ineffective, then examine the patient's throat in the sunlight after depressing the tongue with the instrument described.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps.  If that is unsuccessful, take a hollow tube, insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, and then insert a heated, protected iron rod into the tube.
Repeat this several times.  The patient should abstain from drinking water all day.  Then, the patient should take a jar filled with cool water, open their mouth over it, rinse, and not swallow a drop.  The patient should move the water with their hand from time to time.
The leech will fall off if it senses the water.  If it does not come out by the methods described, fumigate the throat with urine and halit (a specific herb) using the instrument described for fumigation of the larynx.  Do this several times and the leech will fall off.
The method for fumigation is to take a container holding embers heated by fire, and the container is covered with a lid having a hole in the center.  Insert the end of the instrument into this hole.  Place the incense in the container and have the patient place their mouth at the end of the tube, closing their mouth to prevent the incense from escaping until the patient knows it has reached their throat.
The leech will fall off at this point.  If it does not, repeat the fumigation several times.  The patient must endure thirst and eat salty foods and garlic, but not drink any water.  The leech must come out with this treatment.  This is the image of an instrument for pulling out a leech from the throat if it is spotted.
It resembles tongs, as you see, but it has this bend which enters the throat. Its ends resemble the beak of a bird, with the roughness of a file; if it grasps something, it will not let go.
Another instrument is used to press down the tongue. It is a wide iron ring, large enough to encompass the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will. The patient cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument for opening the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
It contains discussion on the incision and lancing of tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied, as will be described one by one in this book.  They differ in their incision and lancing in two ways: one, according to the nature of the tumor itself and the humors it contains.
And the second way is according to the locations in the body where they occur, because a tumor in the head is different from a tumor in the buttocks, and a tumor in a fleshy area is different from a tumor in a joint; each has its own treatment.
Some tumors should not be incised until the pus has matured and is fully formed, while others should be incised when they are still immature, such as tumors near joints.
Because if a tumor near a joint grows and infects the surrounding tissues, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing the limb to be useless, or the tumor might be close to a major organ.
Because if you delay incision until it matures, you will harm the major organ, or if it is near the buttocks, you should incise it while still immature.  You should incise a tumor that is immature and near the buttocks, lest it ulcerate deeply and penetrate into the anus, causing a fistula.
And it becomes incurable to a degree.  You should know the time to incise tumors that have fully matured: this is when the tumor pain subsides, the fever disappears, redness and pulsation decrease, the tumor head softens, and other signs improve.
The incision should be made at the lowest point of the tumor, if possible, to allow easier drainage downwards, or at the thinnest, most prominent part of the tumor.  If the tumors are on the hands or feet, the incision should be along the length of the limb.
The incision should be made in the muscle, tendon, nerve, and artery areas; in general, in all flat, unyielding areas.  However, for areas that bend, the incision should follow the contour of the area.  If the tumor is in a fleshy area, it is best to leave it alone.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said. If you incise it before then, the pus will flow excessively, causing much harm and filth, and the edges of the wound might become hard and deep. Some tumors may be incised across the body in an emergency, or according to the needs of the limb.
Small tumors should be incised once; large tumors, with a wide incision or many incisions, in proportion to the size of the tumor. Some tumors may need the skin to be peeled or cut if it has become like a tattered cloth.
Some have become somewhat dead, like what occurs in many boils and abscesses. Some are incised with a three-angled cut, and some are cut off in the shape of a rue leaf, like a tumor of the groin.
Some require a round or crescent-shaped incision, or similar cuts. Tumors without a head, such as flat, smooth tumors, should only be incised simply. If the tumor is large, has accumulated for a long time, and you have incised it, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, then compress the tumor for another day, and then drain some more pus. Repeat this gradually until all is discharged.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old person, the animal spirit is often weakened by the sudden discharge of pus; the patient might die without you realizing it. Guard against this consequence with the utmost care.
After incising these tumors, you should cleanse the wound and examine it.  If the tumor wound is small or the incision single and simple, use a bandage of linen or old cotton.  If the tumor is large and the incisions numerous,
then you should insert a thread in each incision, so that some threads meet each other.  If the tumor has peeled away or eroded the skin, you should pack it with old cotton or linen strips, without moisture, and keep it compressed for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until healed. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after which you have soaked a linen cloth in them and apply it to the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the remedies and treatments and cauterizations that we have described in many places in this book and in the classifications. If it is winter and the tumor site is heavily innervated, you should soak the dressings in a warm drink and oil.
and place them on the area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply the dressings soaked in water and oil, or in a cold drink and oil.  And when the third day arrives, as we said, you should dissolve the tumor and cleanse it.
And use similar treatments until healed. This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general.  As for the detailed methods, each tumor's treatment is described in a summarized, categorized manner.
Chapter Forty-one.
Concerning the incision on tumors appearing on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, which are a type of swelling within sheaths. They have appearances like a hen's bladder, and their types are numerous.  Some are fatty, and others contain a moisture like mud.
Some contain a moisture like broth or soup, and others are stony, hard.  All of these pose no danger in their incision and removal, unless an artery is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incision is to first probe it with the instrument whose image will follow, called the *muds*, so that you know what it contains. If it contains moisture, then cut it lengthwise with a simple incision like this:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If the moisture is released, peel off the sac containing the moisture and cut it entirely, leaving nothing at all.  Often, it will return if any remains.
Then dip a cotton swab into the astringent ointment, if available, or into salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, as it will consume any remaining sac material.  Then reapply the cotton swab with the astringent a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains.  Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains fatty material, cut it in this manner:
Cut it with a sharp incision, insert forceps into the wound edges, and peel it off from all sides.  Exert all your effort in removing the peritoneum that contains it. If an artery intervenes, do what I have previously described, and do the same for the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as previously mentioned.  The incision on a hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head in some people have no moisture at all.  This is because I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman and found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone.  It could not be broken, even if someone threw it, it would only shatter.  The other swellings that occur in the heads of children are not like this.
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision in all of them, and make the opening at the bottom so that the material flows downwards. Then treat them with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-two.
Concerning incisions on swine-like tumors that often appear on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin.  They may appear on other parts of the body.  Those on the neck may be single or numerous, and some may develop from others.
Each such tumor is contained within its own sac, as is the case with tumors of the head and swellings of the merchandise, as we have described.  These swine-like tumors are numerous, some hard, some containing moisture, and some malignant, unresponsive to treatment.
Of those I observed, those favorable to touch, having a surface close to the color of the skin, movable in every direction, and not adhered to the neck's nerves, veins, or arteries, and not sunken. It is necessary to make a simple incision from top to bottom of the body, along the line from ~J~ to ~B~.
Peel it away from all sides and stretch the edges of the skin with a hook or two, or several hooks if necessary, as we mentioned regarding tumors of the head.  Remove it little by little, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve.  The scalpel should not be excessively sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting or distress the patient, and you cut what you do not need to cut. If you cut a vein or artery and are hindered from your work, place powdered styptic or some astringents that stop bleeding into the wound.
Close the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound relaxes, and it is close to festering. The bleeding will stop at that point. Resume your work until you are finished. Then, examine with your index finger if there are any remaining, then small, further pieces of flesh, cut and remove them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the piece of flesh, you should not cut that piece of flesh from its base, but you should tie it tightly with a doubled thread and leave it until it falls away on its own without harm.  Then fill the wound with used cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment and then treat it.
If you cut the entire piece of flesh, you should bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately, after ensuring that there are no remaining fragments. If you see that a fragment of the piece of flesh's base remains, you must take this into account.
You should aim for the base and root of the flesh when cutting, and use the stitching and what we have mentioned. For pieces of flesh containing moisture, apply a simple compression where the ripening location is evident, and make the compression from below as we have said.
Then, after the compression, apply ointment, such as Egyptian ointment, to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with flesh-growing ointments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-three.
On the incision of the throat for a tumor occurring within the throat.
The ancients have described this incision of the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is in accordance with their words.  However, those with sore throats should avoid incision of the throat, as it will not benefit them.
In order that all the tumors and the lung might be diseased, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no ailment in the trachea, then incision of the throat is necessary to escape the harm of suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do so, we should incise the throat below three rings of the trachea, or make four small transverse incisions between two rings, to the extent of an incision in the pleura, not in the cartilage. This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is without flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the surgeon is timid, then he should stretch the throat's skin with a hook, and then incise the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the pleura which we have described, and he should find evidence of incising the trachea from the phlegm that comes out of it along with whatever is protruding, and from the cessation of voice.  He should leave the wound open for a time, and when the period of fear of suffocation has passed, he should bring together the edges of the wound from the skin.
And he should dissect it alone, without the cartilage.  Then the medicines that promote flesh growth are used until healing occurs.  The author of this book says, "The meaning of this explanation that we have described is that if they see the patient whose throat has been blocked by one of these tumors that they have mentioned.
When the patient was near death, and he was about to die, they went to incising the throat so that the patient might breathe through the wound, and be saved from death.  However, they were instructed to leave the wound open until the illness is completely resolved, and the duration of the illness is about three days, or similar.
Then they ordered the wound to be stitched and treated until it healed.  What I personally witnessed was a servant who took a knife and inflicted a cut on her throat, severing a portion of the lung's trachea.  I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening as if she was about to die.  I examined the wound.
I found that the blood coming from the wound was minimal, so I concluded that she had not severed any vein or artery.  Air was escaping from the wound, so I immediately sutured and treated the wound until she healed.  The servant experienced no further problem, except for a slight hoarseness in her voice.
And after a few days, she returned to her best state.  Therefore, we say that there is no danger in incising the throat.
Chapter Forty-Four.
Concerning the incision on a tumor that appears on the larynx from the outside, and is called a laryngeal tumor.
This tumor, called a laryngeal tumor, is a large tumor the color of the body, common in women, and comes in two types.
Either it is natural or accidental; the natural one is incurable, while the accidental one is of two types: one resembling fatty tumors, and the other resembling tumors that arise from arterial complications, and there is danger in incising it. Therefore, one should not use the knife on it at all, unless it is small. If you probe and examine it with a probe and find that it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any blood vessels, then incise it as you would a tumor. Remove it with its contained sac if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it, and then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-five.
On incision of various tumors.
Tumors are numerous in type, and all types are mentioned in the classification.  It is important here to explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as it is problematic.  I say that an abscess presents with heat, fever, and fearful pains until the swelling subsides. As the pus matures, the fever and severity subside.  A tumor presents with neither heat, fever, nor pain, and it is contained within a peritoneal sac, a specific enclosure.  Its color is the same as the surrounding tissue; its beginning is like a boil, and it grows into a larger or smaller cyst.
They are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.  The colors of the moisture are many, as mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, when treating a tumor, one should first probe and examine it with an instrument called a probe, as its image is found in the next chapter.
Assess the size of the tumor, then withdraw the probe and observe what follows. If a flowing moisture of any color is expelled, make a simple incision, as described for other tumors. If no moisture is expelled after probing, know that it is fatty.
Make a firm incision on it in this manner, as I have taught you, and suspend it by means of hooks. Carefully separate the skin from all sides, and if possible, remove the sac containing the tumor intact.
If the sac breaks during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, which often happens, remove it piece by piece until nothing remains, for if any part remains, large or small, the tumor will likely return.
If you are unsuccessful and only a small portion remains, cauterize the wound with sharp cauterizing materials after completion of the procedure.  Apply compression to the wound and apply something to soothe any inflammation, and treat it with the usual treatment until healed. If the tumor is large, suture the edges and treat it with what will cause healing.
If you encounter a bleeding vessel, whether pulsating or not, immediately apply powdered alum to the affected area. Leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound has suppurated and the blood flow subsides, then proceed with the removal of any remaining tumor tissue.
Chapter Forty-six.
In the images of the instruments.
The instruments used for incision and drainage include scoops, which come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large scoop.
Image of a medium scoop.
Image of a small scoop.
Made of tempered steel, square-ended, tight-fitting to facilitate easy penetration into tumors.  These are the probes, called "برد" (likely meaning "broads"), and also come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Suitable for probing tumors, wounds, fistulas, and abscesses to discover bones and other internal structures within.  Made round, polished smooth like a whetstone, from Chinese brass, or from a type of copper (possibly "espadaroy"), or from bronze, or from iron, or from silver; the best are made from the espadaroy.
Probes may also be made of black lead.  These are suitable for probing fistulas that have a winding path, as their flexibility will accommodate the winding.  They also come in three varieties: long, medium, and short.
In proportion to the depth required by each fistula, and make their thickness according to the fistula's width or narrowness. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks.  They are numerous types, including simple ones—meaning those with a single hook—which come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.  There are also blind hooks, in three types.  And there are hooks with two hooks, also in three types.  And there are curved hooks with two hooks. And there are three types.  Also, there are hooks with three hooks, in three types. All these types need to be in their proper place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium-sized simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium-sized blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large double-hooked probe. Image of a medium-sized double-hooked probe. Image of a small double-hooked probe.
Image of a large three-pronged probe.
Image of a medium-sized three-pronged probe. Image of a small three-pronged probe.
These are images of the scalpels used to cut and excise tumors and growths.  There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its cutting edges are limited, while the other ends are not.  This was done so that it can be used to excise growths without fear of cutting a nerve or artery, and to give the patient some relief from the burning sensation during the excision of the tumor.
These are images of retractors.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made of polished brass, similar to the material used for kohl applicators.  On one end, it resembles a wide spoon with two layers, and within its head, a hidden scalpel blade is concealed, resembling a bird's tongue that extends inward and outward as desired, as you see.
Images of scalpels that are hidden between the fingers when removing tumors, and are not felt by the patient.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Images of cupping instruments used for drawing blood.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or bronze, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  They should be thin.  You should have large and small sizes of these cupping instruments to draw blood quickly in emergencies, when no medicine is available.
However, they should not be used to draw blood from every part of the body, but only from fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
Other smaller instruments like pistachio shells may be made from it, in this form.
Blood can be drawn with these if it flows from a phlebotomy site, or when a vein or artery is severed.  A rounded shape may also be made, as in this image.
Chapter Forty-seven.
In the treatment of the male breast.
The breasts of some people, resembling those of women, may swell during puberty, becoming unsightly and inflamed.  If someone dislikes this, the breast should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. Then, remove all the fat.  Then, fill the wound with the medicated ointment.  Then, close the edges of the wound with stitches and treat it until healed. If the breast sags and relaxes due to bone weakness, as is common in women.
Then, incisions should be made on its upper sides, two incisions shaped like crescents, each touching the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, in this manner. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled away, the fat removed, and the previously mentioned sutures, cauterization, and other treatments are applied until healed.
If you are unable to excise what you should excise, due to the patient's distress or excessive bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it consumes any remaining fat.  Then, treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors appearing under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the pig-like type, hard and encapsulated.  Some contain moisture.  Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~.  If all the matter in the tumor has been discharged, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until healed. If the tumor is of the knot-like pig type, incise it as we described for pig tumors. If the wound extends to pus formation, use cauterization as previously mentioned.
Chapter forty-nine.
On the incision of a tumor arising from an artery or vein, known as an aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often arises from it.  Similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one recognizes whether a tumor and swelling originate from an artery or a vein are as follows: if from an artery, the tumor is oblong, clustered deep within the body, and when you press it with your finger, you feel a crackling sensation.
And that which is from a vein has a round tumor on the surface of the body. Incisions on these tumors are dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body, and if very large, one should avoid treating them with iron.
Also, those in the limbs or head should be avoided.  For those that are swellings of the artery's mouth, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks.  Then, dissect and free the artery from the membranes.
Until it is exposed.  Then insert a needle beneath it, piercing to the other side and tying the artery with a doubled thread at two places, as I explained to you in the section on the arteries in the temples. Then, puncture with a lancet the area between the ligaments until all the blood within is released.
The swelling will then subside, and then use the treatment that causes suppuration until the ligaments fall away. Then treat with the appropriate ointments until healed.
If the swelling is from a vein rupture, you should grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as possible. Then, insert a needle below the area you have grasped, piercing through it, with a doubled thread attached, bringing it out from the other side. Then tie the swelling securely, as I explained to you in tying the hernia on both sides with the ends of the thread.  If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with a separate thread under the entire swelling, where the first needle intersects.
Tie your threads in four places, then cut the swelling in the middle.  Once what is within has come out, cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied.  Then place a poultice, dipped in a potion and oil, upon it. Then use the treatment of twisting and ointments until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
As swelling occurs in arteries and veins, so too does swelling occur in the nerve if a blow is sustained or from excessive exertion, or similar causes.  This is more common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a hard swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body.  It is often painless, and if pressed hard, the patient feels a sensation resembling numbness. The swelling is not deep within the body.
Rather, it is beneath the skin, moving in every direction, and not forward or backward.  Any swelling in the joints should not be treated with iron, as it may cause a wound.  Any found in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook, scrape it, then remove it. Close the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On the removal of warts appearing on the abdomen.
Warts, called "fungal" because of their resemblance to fungi, often appear on the abdomens and other parts of the body of some people.  Their base is thin, and their head is thick; sometimes their lips are turned outward.  They can be small or very large.
I once observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling fungi in every way.  Their thin, whitish base had turned outward and cracked, with moisture constantly dripping from them.  I removed them, one weighing approximately eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.
When removing them, if the affected area is moist and the wart's color is a moist white, with a thin base, cut it with a broad scalpel.  Have a cautery iron ready, as considerable bleeding often occurs during removal.
If bleeding becomes excessive, cauterize the area. If the affected area is sensitive and resists cutting with a knife, take a tightly wound lead thread and bind the wart. Leave it for two days, then increase the tightness of the lead thread, tightening it continuously.
As you tighten it, eventually the wart will break and fall off by itself without further effort.  If the wart has a thick base, there is some risk and uncertainty in cutting it, particularly if it is located on the abdomen.  However, it may be possible to cut off half or a portion of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals.  Beware of cutting a wart that is dark-colored, insensitive, and dull-looking, as this could be a cancerous tumor.  We will discuss cancer after this.
The Fifty-second Chapter.
On treating umbilical protrusion.
Umbilical protrusion arises from various causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum lining the abdomen, allowing abdominal fluids or intestines to protrude, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from trapped air.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and the leakage of abdominal fluids, the tumor will be the same color as the body, soft and painless, and will exhibit varying positions. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, its position will be even more varied than described.  When pressed with your fingers, it will disappear and then reappear, possibly accompanied by gurgling. It will greatly enlarge during bathing and strenuous exertion.  If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If pressed with your hand, it does not disappear, and does not increase or decrease.  If it is due to blood, the tumor will exhibit these signs, but will also appear dark. If it is due to the growth of flesh, the tumor will be hard, firm, and fixed in place.
If it is due to air, its touch will be soft.  The procedure in this case is to observe.  If the umbilical protrusion is due to blood from an artery or vein, or air, treatment should be avoided, as there is danger and deception involved, as I explained in the chapter on tumors caused by arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to the intestines or abdominal fluid, instruct the patient to hold himself still and stand upright, stretched out.  Then, draw a circle of lead around the entire navel. Then, instruct him to lie on his back before you.  Then, with a wide scalpel, make a cut around the navel, at the location marked by the lead.  Then, with a large hook, lift the center of the tumor upwards.  Then, tie the incision site tightly with a strong thread or silk tendon.
The knot of the bandage should be a figure-eight.  Then, open the center of the pulled tumor above the bandage and insert your index finger.  Search for the intestines. If the bandage has caught the intestines, loosen the figure-eight knot and push the intestines back into the abdomen. If it is fluid, extend it with a hook.
Cut off any excess. If an artery or vein is encountered, tie it securely and return to your work. Take two needles; thread two strong threads through them and insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, placing them firmly into the incision.  Then pull the tumor in four places at the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the pulled flesh rots and falls off on its own, or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.  Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh that has grown there.
Or if it is from moisture, you should cauterize the tumor, as we said, and remove the blood or moisture found there, then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have previously described the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications, warning against using iron to treat it lest it ulcerate. We also described cancer originating in the uterus, and warned against treating it.
The ancients said that if the cancer is in a place where it can be completely removed, such as cancer in the breast or thigh, and similar organs suitable for complete removal, especially if it is small and newly formed, then it should be completely removed.  However, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If the cancer is localized, as we mentioned, proceed to draw blood from the patient, repeating this several times, then cauterize it if there is obvious fullness in the veins.
Then, apply a compress to the affected area, allowing the treatment to take effect.  Next, insert appropriate hooks into the cancer and scrape it from all sides along with the skin, completely removing all traces of its roots.  Allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it quickly.
Instead, press on the affected areas and remove all the thick blood with your hand or any available tools. If your work causes a large blood loss due to a severed artery or vein, cauterize the affected vein until the bleeding stops. Then, treat it with further treatment until it heals.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of tumors.
We have previously informed you on the classifications of dropsy, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.  Only the *zaqqi* type of dropsy is treated with iron; the *tabbi* type and the fleshy type are never treated with iron.
If you have treated this *zaqqi* type of tumor with medicines and your treatment has been ineffective, examine whether the patient has become extremely weak or has another illness besides the tumor, such as...
If the patient has a cough, diarrhea, or similar ailments, then avoid treating it with iron, for it is dangerous.  If you see a strong patient, with no illness besides the tumor, who is neither a child nor an elder, then proceed as follows: position the patient standing before you. And a servant behind him should squeeze his abdomen with their hands, pushing the water downward towards the pubic area. Then, take a pointed scalpel in this manner:
Its ends are narrow, elongated, and pointed like a scalpel, but with a slight curvature to avoid entering the intestines during use and causing harm. Then, observe whether the tumor originated from the intestines.
If the tumor originated from the intestines, the incision should be three fingers below the navel, next to the pubic bone. If the tumor originated from liver disease, the incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel. If it originated from spleen disease, the incision should be three fingers to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient intends to lie on, to prevent fluids from accumulating in that weakened area.  Then, pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and insert the instrument into the incision, then raise your hand.
Using the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum as if you were peeling it, to a depth roughly the size of a fingernail. Then, pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, the location of the fluid. Remove the fluid, and insert the instrument, which looks like this...
It is like a thin tube made of silver, copper, or polished leather.  At its base is a small hole, and on its sides are three smaller holes; two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
A pointed probe, resembling a pen's tip, may be placed on the end, like this.
At its upper end is a ring.  If the instrument reaches the fluid, it will drain immediately onto the instrument.  Drain a moderate amount of fluid, because draining more than necessary in a short time may cause the patient's death due to the disintegration of the vital spirit.
Or cause a near-death faintness.  However, drain only what his strength allows, guided by the patient's pulse and complexion. Then, remove the instrument and seal the fluid, as it will retain itself immediately.
Because of the skin covering the opening in the peritoneum, which you were instructed to apply in that manner. Then, repeat the procedure on another day, if you deem the patient suitable for this.
Also withdraw a small amount of fluid.  Do this for several days, while maintaining vigilance to avoid mistakes so that only a small amount of fluid remains.  If you fear for the patient's health and leave a large amount of fluid, treat with hot sand burial.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, enduring thirst, and treatment with dried medicines until recovery.  Cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the fluid as described above.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In treating children born with unperforated or narrow or misplaced urinary openings.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated urethra, and it is necessary to pierce it from the moment of birth.
With a very thin scalpel, in this manner:.
Then insert a thin lead nail into the opening, tie it, and hold it in place for three or four days.  When urination is desired, remove it and then replace it. If you do not use the lead, the urine passing through the area may not allow it to close.
And for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.  And those with an opening in the wrong place, some are born with the opening at the end of the urethra, and they cannot urinate forward.
Until the urethra is raised by hand upward.  He is not born with the semen capable of reaching the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very serious problem. The procedure in this case is for the patient to lie on their back.
Then, with your left hand, stretch his urethra forcefully.  Cut the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like a penknife or as if you were carving something, to make the center protrude, like a urethra, so that the opening is in the center as required.
Be careful of bleeding during the procedure, as it often occurs.  Stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the sores that appear on the foreskin, urethra, and dark discoloration, decay, and adhesion of the foreskin to the urethra.
This sore often appears on the urethra, as a dark, fleshy growth.  It can be malignant or benign.  A benign growth should be treated with a gentle snare.
Cut it completely until it is cleansed, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment.  Afterwards, treat it with palm ointment until healed. However, if the sore is malignant, dark-colored, then cauterization must be used after cutting and removing the affected area.
If the sore is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and some of the sore is inside the foreskin and some outside, then the sore inside must be removed first. Once it has healed, then treat the external sore.
Because if you treat both simultaneously, you risk perforating the foreskin.  This can also occur in women, and blackening and decay can appear in the foreskin.  Therefore, you must cauterize any blackened areas that may decay or have already decayed.
Then apply honey, crushed and sifted pomegranate rind, and carson to the affected area.  Afterwards, treat it with the usual remedies until healed.  If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cauterizing iron in this manner:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, namely, bleeding and decay of the wound. If the foreskin is completely destroyed at some point, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra to allow urination. Regarding the foreskin adhering to the shaft...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy but who have not been circumcised, and it may also occur from a wound or tumor.  The foreskin should be separated with a sharp scalpel until the bond is broken and the shaft is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon examination, a small portion of both the shaft and foreskin should be separated.  The foreskin is thin and may easily tear.  Separate the foreskin from the shaft with a thin, damp linen cloth to prevent further adhesion.
Then treat with a astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-seven.
On the purification of boys and the treatment of errors affecting them.
Circumcision is nothing more than separating a connection, like other surgical procedures, but since it is a procedure performed by us with intent, and is particularly used in boys, it is necessary to design the best possible course of action for it.
The easiest path to safety, I say, is that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have adopted.
Through experience, I have found that the majority of practitioners, surgeons, and barbers, use purification with knives and scissors, using the cautery, ligatures, and incisions with the fingernail. I have tested all these methods.
Thus, I found nothing better than purification with scissors and ligation with thread, because purification with a knife often results in damage to the skin.  The skin of the foreskin has two layers; thus, it is possible that the upper layer of skin is cut, while the lower layer remains.
One is then forced to make another incision and suffer further pain.  Cautery does not provide security against cutting the urethral tip, because it might have entered its opening.  As for purification by fingernail, the skin might tear, and your work spoiled, or the boy's skin might be naturally thin.
Thus, many are born without needing purification, as I have seen.  As for purification by scissors and ligation with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors have a balanced cut, since the blade above is like the blade below.
When you squeeze your hand with the blades balanced, the cut is uniform and made at the same time.  The thread thus becomes like a wall for the urethral skin on all sides, and no mistake occurs.  First, the procedure involves calming the child.
Especially if he is somewhat understanding, explain that you are only tying the thread to his urethra, leaving it for another day. Then, cheer and delight him in every way you can, and whatever he can comprehend.  Then, have him stand before you, erect.
Do not have him sit. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot.  Do not let the boy's eyes see them or any instruments.  Then, insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin, lifting it upwards until the urethral head emerges.
Then clean it of any accumulated dirt.  Then tie a doubled thread at the marked spot.  Then, tie a second thread slightly below it.  Then, using your thumb and index finger, grip the lower ligation firmly and cut between the ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the urethral head.  Allow the blood to flow a little; this is better and lessens urethral swelling. Then dry it with a damp cloth, and dust it with powdered, burned dry gourd ashes; this is the best I have tried, or finely ground carob flour; it is also excellent.

Then dry it with a damp cloth, and dust it with powdered, burned dry gourd ashes; this is the best I have tried, or finely ground carob flour; it is also excellent. Then place him on his back, using a cloth.  Place a cooked egg in rosewater, beaten with fine, fragrant rose oil, and leave it on him for another day.  Then treat him with further remedies until he is healed.
This is an image of the appropriate scissors for cleaning.
The scissors should be sharp and straight, not bent, with the head of a nail.  The blades should be the same length as the handles.  A common mistake in cleaning is that the skin that is inside may be entirely or partially turned over during the cut, so it is necessary to stretch it with your fingernail at the same time, before the affected area swells.
Cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and the area beneath the urethral head remains swollen, let the hot swelling subside and gently peel it off.
Cut it according to your judgment, and be careful around the urethral head. If some of the urethral head is cut, it will not be harmful. Treat it with the cauterants described in the article on cauterants.
If more skin is cut than needed and it shrinks upwards, this will not cause much harm either. Treat it as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-eight.
On the treatment of obstructed urine in the bladder.
Obstructed urine in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or growing tissue, and the like.  If you treat it with the various treatments described in the classification, then [the condition] will be resolved.
If the urine has not passed and you suspect the obstruction is due to a stone damaging the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then one leg should be placed on their back, and their abdomen should be pressed against their back. The patient should hold themselves in place as much as possible.
This will force the neck of the bladder to push the stone backward, allowing the urine to flow. If the urine does not flow with this method and the patient's condition worsens, then the extraction of the stone using an instrument called catheters, of which this is an image [of]:  should be employed.
Made of silver, it is thin, smooth, hollow, like a bird's feather tube in its thinness.  It is about a foot and a half long, with a gentle funnel at its head.  The method of drawing the urine with it is to take a folded thread and tie a piece of wool or cotton to one end securely.
You insert the end of the thread into the lower end of the catheter and cut off any excess wool using pliers so that it enters the tube, closing it like a button.  Then, the catheter should be lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
His bladder and urethra are softened with moist ointments or warm water and oil.  Then, the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra.  Then, the urethra is pulled upward towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed into it.
Once the urethra is pulled, the catheter is pushed inside until it is near the anus.  The penis is then tilted downward while the catheter is inside, and pushed until it reaches the bladder, where the patient feels that it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this manner because the channel through which the urine flows is curved.  If the thread with the wool is pulled gently, the urine will follow the wool.  Then, it is withdrawn and the urine is poured out, and the catheter is reinserted.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Illustrations of suitable instruments for this purpose are made of silver or of hollowed ivory, with a long, thin tube.  To instill water and medications, a device called a syringe is used.  Here is its image/illustration:.
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long, slender tube, hollowed throughout except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollowed portion where the nozzle is, should be just large enough to accommodate it without excess.  Thus, when pulling something moist, it will be pulled, and when pushing, it will be pushed outward, just as in the case of the oil-thrower used in naval warfare.
If you wish to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull upwards on the nozzle.  The moisture will be drawn into the syringe.  Then, insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, as described for catheters, and push the moisture out with the nozzle.
This moisture will reach the bladder and the patient will feel it.  This is also a picture of a delicate enema syringe, used to irrigate the bladder.
Made of silver or lead, with a head resembling a small funnel at its top and a groove below to hold the cord. Then, take a camel's bladder and place in it the moisture you wish to irrigate the bladder with. Then tie it securely between the two parts with a doubled thread.
Warm the moisture slightly over the fire. Then insert the tip of the irrigator into the urethra. Then firmly press on the bladder containing the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin material, make a circle from it, and pierce it all around. Then insert a strong thread through those holes as you go around. Then gather the circle, as you would gather a table cloth, after placing the desired moisture, ointments, and water within it.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing stones.
We have previously discussed the types of stones, their treatment with medication, and the differences between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, along with their symptoms.  We have also described stones requiring manual removal and incision.
This refers specifically to stones formed in the bladder, and those that develop in the urethra.  I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones are most often found in children.  A sign of this is that the urine exiting the bladder is thin like water.
Sand appears in it, and he rubs and plays with his penis, often hanging down.  The anus also frequently prolapses in many of them.  Children recover from it easily until they are fourteen, whereas it is difficult in the elderly; in young adults it is intermediate between the two.
Those with larger stones have easier treatment, while the opposite is true for smaller stones.  If we turn to treatment, first, the patient should be given an enema to remove all the impurities from his intestines, as this can prevent the stone from being seen during examination.
Then the patient is taken by their feet and shaken downwards to cause the stone to descend into the neck of the bladder, or he is made to jump from a high place several times.  Then, he is seated upright before you, with his hands beneath his thighs, so that the entire bladder is tilted downwards, and then examined.
Feel it from the outside. If you sense the stone in the space, immediately make an incision on it.  If it is not at all palpable, you should smear the index finger with grease from the left hand if the patient is a child, or the middle finger.
If it is a fully grown boy, insert it into his anus, and search for the stone.  Once you find it under your finger, move it little by little towards the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place where you intend to make the incision.
You instruct a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and another servant to stretch the vulva upwards with his right hand and the skin beneath the vulva towards the location of the incision with his left hand. Then, take the forceps, which have this form:
Make the incision between the anus and the vulva, not in the middle, but to the side of the left groin.  The incision should be directly on the stone, with your finger in the anus pressing it outwards in an oblique manner so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, to the extent possible, so that the stone can be removed.
Do not press too hard, for the finger in the anus might push the stone out when making the incision, which will be less difficult.  Know that some stones have angles and edges, which makes removal more difficult.
Some are smooth, like acorns, and round, making removal easier.  Those with angles and edges require a slightly wider incision. If it does not come out this way, then you must devise a strategy, either by grasping it with a firm forceps, the tip of which is like a rasp.
So that it grasps the stone firmly and does not slip.  Or, if possible, introduce a delicate, curved instrument underneath it. If you are unable to do that, widen the incision slightly. If blood starts to flow excessively, stop the bleeding with a cautery.
If there is more than one stone, remove the largest first into the bladder opening, then make an incision around it, and then remove the smaller ones afterward. Do the same if there are more than two. If the stone is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision, as this would expose the patient to one of two problems.
Either he will die, or he will experience constant dribbling of urine, because the area will never heal properly. But try to push it out.  Or, devise a strategy to break it with forceps until it comes out in pieces.
Once your work is done, dress the wound with kandar, sabr, and sheyan, applying pressure and placing a bandage soaked in oil, a drink, or rose ointment and cold water over it to soothe the inflamed area.  Then the patient should lie on their back, and do not remove the bandage for three days.
When the swelling subsides, wash the area thoroughly with water and oil, then treat it with the date palm ointment and the basilisk ointment until healed. If excessive inflammation, swelling, or other problems, such as blood clotting in the bladder that prevents urination (which will be recognized by the presence of blood in the urine), arise in the wound.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of condition with a similar remedy until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, it is necessary to bind the thighs together to hold the medications applied to the affected area in place.  If the stone is small and lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and blocking urine flow, treat it with the methods I've described before it progresses to a rupture.
Often, this treatment obviates the need for incision.  I have tested this method using a lancet of tempered steel, of this form:
A triangular, pointed blade is fitted to a handle.  Then, a thread is used to tie the penis below the stone, to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  Then, the lancet is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the lancet a little at a time against the stone, aiming to pierce it through to the other side.  Urine will flow immediately.  Then, press with your hand on the remaining portion of the stone outside the penis.  It will break apart and pass with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not possible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone.  Then, make an incision on the stone within the penis between the threads and remove it.
Then, release the threads and clean the clotted blood in the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread was tied above it so that when the threads are released after the stone is removed, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-one.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women. If one of them presents with a stone, treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One reason is that the woman might be a virgin, and another that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a doctor.
If she is chaste or from among those with restrictions, a third reason is that you do not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially manual work. Fourth, the location of the incision for a stone in women is distant from the stone's location, requiring a deep incision.
And there is danger in that. If necessity demands it, a skilled female physician should be sought; however, such a person is rarely found. If not found, seek a trustworthy and virtuous male physician, or bring in a skilled female midwife or a woman with some knowledge of this craft.
She should be brought in and instructed to perform whatever examination is necessary for the stone.  First, if the woman is a virgin, the finger should be inserted into her vagina to search for the stone. If found, the stone should be pressed against the finger.
If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, after first placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should guide it from the mouth of the bladder downward to the extent of her ability until it reaches the root of the thigh, and then make an incision on the corresponding side of the vagina, at the root of the thigh, from whichever direction she finds the stone in that area.
And her finger must remain on the stone, pressing it. The incision should initially be small.  Then, the probe should be inserted into the small incision.  If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision as much as necessary to allow the stone to exit.  Know that there are many types of stones.
Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and those with protrusions.  Understand their varieties so that you can ascertain what you need. If blood flows excessively, sprinkle powdered alum on the area and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones in men, to aid in your work. If excessive bleeding occurs and you know the bleeding is from a severed artery, apply styptics to the area.
Bind it firmly with dressings, and leave it. Do not return to it. Leave the stone; do not remove it. Perhaps the patient will die.  Then treat the wound. Once the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area is infected, return to your work until the stone is expelled.
Chapter Sixty-two.
In the fissure of the watery fistula.
A watery fistula is the accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum beneath the scrotum's skin surrounding the testicle.  It may also be in a special membrane, naturally formed on one side of the testicle.
It may be mistaken for another testicle and lie between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum, as we mentioned.  This only happens rarely.  This fistula arises from weakness in females, leading to the accumulation of this material.  It may also result from a blow to the scrotum.
This moisture comes in various colors, either yellow, reddish-bloody, dark-dusky, or whitish-watery, the latter being the most common.  The signs by which it is recognized are...
Where the water collects, if it's in the white peritoneum we mentioned, the swelling is somewhat elongated and round, like an egg, and the testicle isn't visible because the moisture surrounds it completely.
If the moisture is in a separate membrane, the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, one might imagine it as another testicle.  If the moisture lies between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum, it is palpable. To determine the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe we previously described.  Judge the color by the appearance of the probe's impression.
If we turn to treatment with leeches, the patient should be bled if possible and if their body is full.  Then, the patient should lie on their back on a slightly elevated surface, with several cloths underneath, and you should sit to their left.
Instruct a servant to sit on the patient's right, extending the patient's penis towards one side of the scrotum and towards the lower abdominal region. Then, take a wide scalpel and make a lengthwise incision through the scrotum's skin, extending almost to the pubic area.
The incision should be made in a straight line parallel to the line dividing the scrotum in half, until it reaches the white peritoneum.  Peel this back, taking care not to cut it.  Make your peel from the side that is closest to the testicle and continue to peel as far as possible.
Then, thoroughly empty the water-filled peritoneum.  Separate the edges of the incision with forceps.  Lift the peritoneum upward, avoiding contact with the scrotal skin. Cut the peritoneum, either in one piece or in sections, as you can.
Especially the thinner portion, if not completely cut, there is a risk of the water returning. If the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your work, once you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it to its place and then stitch the edges of the scrotal skin together.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until healed.  If the testicle has been damaged by another condition, it is necessary to tie off the vessels in the sac to prevent bleeding.  Then, detach the testicle from the sac, remove the testicle, and treat it as previously described.
If the collected water is in both areas, know that it is a double hydrocele.  Incise the other side in the same way you did the first, or if you prefer, perform a single operation, then remove the blood.
Insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  Place another layer of wool soaked in liquid and oil on top, covering the testicles and the abdominal area.  Then place a folded cloth, the *rafayd*, on top. Tie it with the six-pointed bandage in this manner.
Then take two cloths, stitch them together, and fill them with fluffy wool in this fashion.  Make the ties from damp cotton or wool and tighten them with a belt around the trousers.  One end of the ties is secured on the buttocks, leading towards the back.
The other end goes towards the pubic area, and the two ends are placed on the lower thighs. The remaining two ends are placed on the hips.  All the ties are fastened with a belt around the trousers.  This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
This involves taking a gentle, heated scalpel to cut the scrotal skin, exposing the white peritoneum containing the water. Then take another cauterizing instrument in this manner:
It resembles a Greek eye; then cauterize that peritoneum while it is hot until all the moisture is expelled.  Then stretch the peritoneum with forceps and, using the cauterizing instrument, scrape off and cut the surrounding layer as much as possible to remove all of it, taking care not to burn the testicle.
Know that this method is safer and less likely to cause bleeding and is better than using incision. If, during the incision or cauterization process, a hot tumor, bleeding, or anything else arises, you should treat whatever occurs with the appropriate treatment as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot tolerate this procedure due to its unpleasantness, then use the cauterization method as described, if, based on the previous signs, it is appropriate.
If the discharge is watery, the patient should be seated on a high chair.  Then cauterize the swelling at the base with a broad probe.  Position the cauterization along the body, making the opening wide enough for all the water to drain.  Then place cotton on the area and bandage it.
Allow the remaining water to drain, then treat the wound until it heals. If the water does not drain during the cauterization, this is likely because the white membrane is obstructing the opening of the wound, preventing the water from escaping.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the tool used to extract the water from the beloved (a previously described instrument), into the wound, or widen the wound opening slightly.
Know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it does collect, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should endure the days.
Chapter Sixty-three.
On the incision of fleshy sores and their treatment.
Know that incision on these sores is fraught with danger, leading to death in most cases. Therefore, we recommend leaving them alone and avoiding it.  I will describe the treatments for them and the various types of tumors.
I say that many tumors can occur in the bodies composed of two parts. This occurs from various causes, either from a sharp discharge settling into the body parts or from injury. The tumor's color will be the same as the body's color, and it will not have any water.
The tumor will be hard, and it may be stony, dark in color, and without sensation.  It may also arise from the complication and swelling of arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of veins.  If from arterial swelling, it is recognized by the spreading of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be incised at all.  As for that which arises from swelling of the veins, nothing spreads when pressed with fingers.  This type may be incised, like other flesh.
One should incise the scrotum's skin, then pull the testicle upward, and remove it from the white peritoneum.  Free the suspended part from the vessels, tie off the vessels, and cut the suspended part after freeing it from every side of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to the growing flesh.
Then the testicle should be removed and cut. If the adhesion is between parts of the peritoneum or between vessels, then all of that adhesion should be freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the flesh growth is in the place of the adhesion, which is behind, then all of it should be cut and the testicle removed, as we said.  When your work is finished, dress the wound with moistened wool in rose-oil and a drink, and then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Sixty-fourth Chapter.
On treating the dropsy which is with the dilated [organ].
Dilatation is a twisted swelling, resembling a bunch of grapes, along with relaxation of the female [parts].  It makes it difficult for the afflicted person to move, exercise, and walk.  In treating this ailment, the approach is similar to what was mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as performed by the ancients.  I say that the afflicted person should sit on a raised chair, then pull the [female] appendages downwards, and then grasp the scrotum skin with your fingers along with the vessels close to the penis.
A servant of yours holds it and stretches it strongly.  Then, with a wide, sharp scalpel, make a slanting incision alongside the vessels until the vessels are exposed.  Then, peel it off from all sides, as I described to you in the removal of the arteries in the temples.  Then insert a needle with a doubled thread into it.
Tie it at the initial points where the dilatation occurred, and also tie it at its end.  Then, make a vertical incision down the length of the body through the middle, and remove the accumulated turbid, corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound as with other surgical wounds that require time to heal so the vessels nourishing one of the [female] parts will fall off.  There is no problem with that.  However, if the dilatation affects all vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the [female] parts along with the vessels, so that the egg does not lack nourishment. Before the vessels are cut, it withers and is of no use.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
In the treatment of intestinal discharge.
This discharge occurs from a fissure that appears in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen, near the groin area.  The intestine then protrudes from this hernia into one of the [female] parts.
This hernia may be either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension. These two types occur from many causes, such as a blow, a jump, a cry, or lifting a heavy object, and so on.  A sign of the hernia arising from the extension of the peritoneum is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly.  The swelling is gradual to the depth because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.  A sign of the hernia being from a fissure in the peritoneum is that it initially causes severe pain all at once, and the swelling is distinct and visible under the skin nearby.
This is due to the intestine exiting from the peritoneum, and sometimes pus may also exit with the intestine, in which case the discharge is called intestinal and purulent.  It may also have air, and sometimes intestinal waste may become trapped there, leading to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if compressed.  Treatment of these types of illnesses with iron is dangerous, so one must avoid it.  The method of treatment is to instruct the patient to push the intestine back into its place with his hand if it can be returned.
Then, the patient lies on their back before you, and you raise their legs.  Then, pull up the skin around the groin, and make a lengthwise incision through the entire scrotum.  Then, insert hooks into the edges of the cut to the extent needed to open the incision further.
The incision should be as large as possible to allow the testicle to exit.  Then, the peritoneum under the scrotum skin is peeled back until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  Then, insert your index finger behind the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum underneath the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, release the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, with your right hand, pull inwards on the scrotum skin.  At the same time, pull the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand, lifting the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
You instruct the attendant to pull the testicle upwards, and you completely release the adhesions behind it.  Examine with your finger to ensure that no twisted intestines are within the hard white peritoneum.  If you find any, push them back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with thick thread, twisted from ten strands, and insert it at the edge of the peritoneum under the scrotum skin near the incision. Then, cut the ends of the thread so there are four strands left. Then, interweave some of the strands together in a solid manner and tie them tightly around the peritoneum, which we mentioned is under the scrotal skin, on both sides. Then also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels supplying it can reach it. So that no inflammatory swelling is formed.  Also, create a second ligature outside the first, at least two finger widths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a space of about the size of a fingertip of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin.
So that no inflammatory swelling is formed.  Also, create a second ligature outside the first, at least two finger widths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a space of about the size of a fingertip of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin. Cut the rest completely around and remove the testicle. Then, make an incision under the scrotal skin that bleeds and oozes, as we described previously.  Then use wool soaked in oil, placing it in the wound.  Apply the ligature we described.
The white peritoneum, after cutting, may need cauterization to prevent bleeding, as this frequently happens.  Leave the ligature until it falls off naturally.  If it is slow to fall off, apply hot water and apply something to cause sweating to help it come off.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for surgical wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-six.
In this type of flatulence, I have seen no one dare to treat it with iron.  The ancients mentioned making it as described in the flatulence with a 'dalia', which involves tying off the vessels gently after making an incision below.
Then, make an incision in the middle and treat the swelling to open it so that the vessels fall out. Treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-six.
In the hernia which occurs in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may appear, as we said, but nothing of the intestines descends into the groin. If anything does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
However, if it persists for a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases, causing the intestines and testicles to descend into the scrotum. This occurs due to the extension of the peritoneum in the groin, as we have said. This is because the peritoneum extends and then relaxes, causing the area to bulge.  Treatment is by cauterization, as its description was previously given.
And it can be treated with iron in this way: the patient lies on their back before you, then you cut the bulging, protruding hernia area across, to a width of three fingers, and then you separate the layers of peritoneum beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath is exposed. Then you take a thread, place it on the bulging area of the peritoneum, and press it into the depth of the abdomen.  Then stitch the two bulging areas, one to the other, on the end of the thread of the peritoneum, joining them together with stitches.
Then pull the thread and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have instructed you in the treatment of intestinal obstruction. Then treat it with the treatments for surgical cases.
When the stitches are severed, cleanse and close the wound until it heals, then the peritoneum contracts and the herniation does not increase.
And this is the best method in this situation, because it is closest to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
On Relaxation of the Scrotum's Skin.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the internal tissues relaxing, and this spoils its appearance.  Therefore, whoever desires to treat this, should lay the patient on their back.
And cut all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then bring the edges together. If you prefer, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and secure them, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other surgical conditions until it heals and the stitches fall out.
The Sixty-ninth Chapter.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I have done so for two reasons: one, so that a physician will know it if asked about it and know the treatment for those affected; and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as sheep, oxen, and cats, and similar animals. I say that castration is of two types: either by pressing or by incision and cutting.  The method of pressing is that we place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then you press it with your hand until it dissolves and is no longer discernible when touched. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the cords and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them off after peeling them and leaving no peritoneum on them except the thin peritoneum that is on the vessels. This method of castration is better than that done by pressing.
Because pressing might leave some of the testicles, and the animal will desire mating, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On treating hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men comes in two types. One appears in the area below the pubic bone or on the scrotal skin between the testicles as if it were a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from what is in the scrotal skin.
In women, there is one type, appearing above the vulva on the pubic bone, like small, protruding male testicles. One of them appears as a man's penis, and both resemble female genitalia.  Treatment for all three types.
The two types of men and the one type of women, the excess flesh should be cut until the effect subsides, then treated with other surgical treatments until healed.  As for the second type of men from whom urine flows from the scrotal skin, no action is taken, and it will not heal.
Chapter Seventy-one.
In the excision of the clitoris and excess flesh from the vulva of women.
The clitoris may increase beyond the natural size, becoming unsightly and discoloured.  In some women, it may enlarge to the extent of resembling that of men, affecting sexual intercourse.
One should grasp the excess clitoris with a hand or forceps and cut it off. Do not cut too deeply, especially into the root, to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until healed.  As for the excess flesh, it is flesh that grows in the vaginal opening until it fills it.
And it may extend outwards, resembling a tail. Therefore, some early practitioners called it the "tail" disease.  One should cut it off, just as one cuts the clitoris, and treat it until healed.
Chapter Seventy-two.
On the treatment of ruptures.
Rupture is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the perforation is small, and it may be either congenital or acquired.  The acquired type is due to a preceding cause, and may arise from excess overgrown flesh.
or from thin or thick peritoneum, and it may be in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or above or below it.  It prevents intercourse, procreation, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.  Knowledge of this condition is obtained by examination by the midwife.
If the obstruction is evident and close at hand, then if it is not apparent, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and is close to the labia, then proceed to pierce it; that is to say, place something like a splint on the labia, then place both of your thumbs.
And the woman lies on her back with her legs spread, then forcefully separates the labia until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction opens.  Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and have intercourse with the woman daily, so that the area does not adhere again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be cut with a broad scalpel resembling a thin, flat knife. If the obstruction is from overgrown flesh, grasp it with forceps and cut it off.  Have with you remedies to stop bleeding without causing a wound, such as pomegranate, alum, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not quickly close up. Hold it in place for several days, and use a wick made of dry linen, then treat it with the usual remedies for an abscess until it heals.  There may be further growths of flesh in the uterus, which should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, the cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in women's vulvas.
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of the mouths of the veins, causing copious, continuous bleeding.  If hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  We have already mentioned their types and signs in the classification; we describe them here.
Of these, some are treatable, some not.  I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if deep within the uterus and not apparent to touch, are not treatable with iron.  Those on the mouth of the uterus, which can be felt, are those that are treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then use a scalpel or rough cloth to remove the warts from their roots.  Then, if blood flows from one of the blood-stopping tools, stop it without pricking.
For example, with caquia, shiyan, and frankincense, and similar things.  Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cool water.  If the bleeding persists, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and astringents, and similar things.  Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back.  If the bleeding stops, then stop. Otherwise, apply leeches to the chest and breastbone, without any restrictions. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of the thyme or the juice of the asparagus or the juice of the willow branches, with astringent drink, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals.  As for a red sore, resembling the heads of sores, rough in appearance, it should be cut away as described for warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the treatment of abscesses that appear in the uterus.
Many types of tumors can appear in the uterus, such as cancer, hardened tumors, ulcers, canker sores, malignant sores, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and inflamed tumors.  All these diseases and their types and signs have been described in the classification.
Therefore, in this section we must discuss the inflamed tumor that appears in the uterus, if it is a tumor that has gathered for a time, how to treat it with iron.  One must observe if the tumor's pain in its initial stages is severe, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red, if touched, do not rush to treat it. Treat it with what aids ripening until these symptoms subside.  Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back.
And she should bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, binding them with a suitable bandage.
Then, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument to open the cervix, the image of which will be shown later. If you intend to use this instrument, you must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
Otherwise, the patient will be harmed. If the instrument is longer than the depth, then pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterine depth.  The spiral that runs inside the instrument should be positioned from the upper side.
And while you hold the instrument, the attendant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened. If a boil appears and is felt with the hand to be soft and thin, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel. When all the matter has been discharged.
A soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound. The wick should be protruding from the incision in the cervix.  Outside, on the uterus and pubis, place pure wool dipped in boiled water for baking.
Then, treat with the appropriate ointment for two days until healed.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water boiled with root of the sos or long zeraound.  Then, return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Avoid treating it with iron; rather, treat it as described in the division.
Chapter seventy-five.
Teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural form of childbirth.  Among its signs, if you see the woman pressing downwards, longing to breathe the air, and feeling relief from her postpartum state.
And if the delivery of the fetus is swift, know that this birth is natural, and the fetus emerges headfirst with the placenta attached or hanging from the umbilical cord.  If you see these signs, then you should massage her abdomen to expedite the delivery of the fetus.
If it emerges headfirst, the placenta descends with it, and is cleaned thoroughly of any abnormalities.  Any birth other than this is unnatural and reprehensible, as the fetus may emerge feet first, with its hands or feet coming out before its head.
And if one hand or one foot emerges, or if its head and hand, or if it emerges folded, or perhaps if it turns on its back, and similar reprehensible forms, the midwife should be skilled and gentle with all these things, and wary of mistakes and errors.
And I am explaining each of these forms and how to manage them, so that you can recognize them. If the fetus emerges headfirst, the natural way, and the labor is difficult and the woman's strength weakens, then have her sit on a chair and order women to restrain her.
And bind her uterus with cooked linseed and moist ointments.  Then the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers, and cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, until the moisture within it drains. Then massage the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with linseed saliva mixed with sheikh oil.  Then, after the injection, she should be made to cough and sneeze with a knick-knacks and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will emerge then. If the child's hands emerge first, they should be gently pushed back, little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a platform and lift her legs up. Then shake the platform on the ground, and the woman holds on so she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, and it will emerge. If the fetus emerges on its feet, then the feet should be pushed upward, then the fetus should be turned slightly, little by little, until it is straightened, then one of its legs should be gently pulled.
If they [the legs] emerge to the thighs, instruct her to cough and sneeze her with a knick-knacks, and it will emerge. If it does not emerge as described, then gently turn the fetus back to its natural position. Then it will emerge smoothly.  If it resists all these methods.
Take some saliva of the *khatmi*, saliva of linseed, and sheikh oil, and dissolved gum. Grind all of them well in a mortar. Then apply it to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen. Then, make her sit in lukewarm water until the shurasif.
If you see that it has softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh and have her endure it. If she holds the pessary for an hour, have her sit on a chair, then sneeze her, close her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen. Then the fetus will emerge immediately. The fetus will emerge on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands, little by little. Then, the woman should lie on her back, her hips lowered, lying on a bed, and holding her hands. Then, gently press on top of her abdomen. Then remove the cushions from under her legs so that they are raised. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously. Then, gently press above the shurasif, little by little, until the fetus rises. Then the midwife should insert her hand and gently adjust the fetus.
And instruct the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The fetus will emerge sideways, with one arm hanging down.  Gently try to return the arm. If unable to, have the woman stand and walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously. Then use the ointment, which I described, made from saliva. If it is dislodged, have her sit on a chair and work to reposition the arm and straighten the fetus to its normal form. Have the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
The fetus emerges on its back, arms outstretched, and face towards the mother's back. The midwife should grasp the fetus's arm and gently turn and straighten it. Once straightened, apply the fats and saliva we previously described.
Then instruct her to move slowly.  If she does so, have her sit on a chair, and instruct her to lean to the right side.  Then have her strain, and use a compress to make her sneeze.  The fetus will emerge, upright on its side.
If it descends into the cervix in this manner with the placenta, then slit the placenta with your fingernail to remove excess moisture.  If it is wrapped around the fetus's face and neck, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent suffocation and death.  Then push the fetus inward, so that it is in proper position.
Tell the woman to strain repeatedly, and it will emerge easily.  Regarding the birth of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins are common; three or four may also be born and survive, but this is rare.  As for five, it is unnatural and they will never survive.
And if there are many, they are surrounded by a single placenta.  They are separated by a partition-like membrane connecting each to its own umbilical cord.  They may emerge like a single fetus, naturally and easily, or they may emerge with difficulty, as described previously.
If some of them are difficult to deliver and take on the abnormal forms we mentioned, treat them as described.  Let the midwife be gentle, and perform the actions with care and patience, using any method that leads to safety.
The number of fetuses that can be conceived in the womb is variable: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten.  I have evidence that one woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all simultaneously conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Knowing and All-Powerful, this knowledge must be part of a midwife's understanding.  Perhaps such a case might occur, and she must be prepared to address it accordingly.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the delivery of a dead fetus.
If, after treating the dead fetus with the methods described in the classification, it does not emerge and you are forced to manually intervene, then you must consider the woman's condition. If she is strong and has no symptoms that suggest potential harm, the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downward, and her legs raised. A servant should hold her from both sides or secure her to the bed to prevent her body from shifting when the fetus is delivered.
Then, moisten the mouth of her uterus with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the *khatmi* (a plant), fenugreek, and linseed. The midwife then anoints her hand with these ointments and saliva, gently inserting it into the uterus.  Then, she seeks a place to implant hooks into the fetus, and the appropriate locations for this.
Observe; if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, implant the hooks in its eyes, back of the head, mouth, palate, under the chin, collarbone, near the ribs, or beneath the clavicles.
And if it is descending feet-first, then into the pubic area and the middle ribs.  The hook should be held in the right hand, its curve positioned between the fingers of the left hand. The hand should be inserted gently and a hook implanted in one of the aforementioned locations.
Until it reaches an empty space. Then, another or a third hook is inserted opposite the first, if needed, to ensure the pull is even and not biased to one side. The pull should be steady and not just straight, but also moved in every direction.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth during extraction.  During this, the pull should be relaxed if any part is obstructed. If a part is obstructed, the midwife should anoint some fingers with the ointment and insert them to turn the obstruction. If some part of the fetus emerges, the hooks should be moved to other locations.
She [the midwife] should slightly raise it [the fetus] to do this until the entire fetus is expelled. If a hand emerges before other parts and cannot be pushed back due to compression, it should be wrapped in a cloth and pulled out until it is all expelled, then cut off.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow. This should be done for the other hand and feet as well.  If the fetus's head is large and encountering pressure during delivery, or if there is accumulated fluid in the head, a pointed/sharp scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.
With it, the head is cracked open to allow the water to exit, or it is pressed with an instrument called a *mashdakh*, whose image will appear with the images of other instruments in the following chapter.
Likewise, if the fetus has a large head, it should be cracked or pressed with the *mashdakh*, as we said, then the bones are extracted with forceps.  If the head comes out and is compressed at the collarbone, it should be cracked open to allow the moisture in the chest to drain.
Then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and cannot be expelled, cut it as best as possible.  If the lower abdomen is swollen or has lumps, it should be incised so that the moisture may drain from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it and positioning it toward the cervix is easy. If it is compressed against the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be incised to allow the contents to drain.
If all the other organs have been removed and the head remains inside, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix, locate the head, and pull it with her fingers toward the cervix. Then, she should insert a hook or two hooks and pull it out with them.
If the cervix has contracted due to a hot, inflamed tumor, it should not be forcibly treated, but rather moist, fatty substances should be applied, and bandages used. She should sit in relaxing, moist waters.
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be positioned, the same methods described for a living fetus should be used. If that is not possible, it should be cut open and removed.  Absolutely nothing of the placenta should be left inside.  Once you have finished your treatment, apply the treatments for hot tumors that appear in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should sit in constricting waters and use other treatments.  I have observed a woman who conceived, then had the fetus die within her, and subsequently conceived again.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, a tumor appeared in her womb and swelled until it opened, discharging pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.  I applied some strong, astringent ointments to it.
Then a bone came out of the area, and after a few days, another bone came out. I was surprised by this, as the abdomen does not contain bones.  I concluded that they were bones from the dead fetus.  I probed the wound and removed many bones from the fetal skull.
I continued this until I extracted many bones. The woman was in good condition and lived for a considerable time, with a small amount of pus continuing to discharge from the area.  I have presented this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what a skilled physician attempts with his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This binder with which books are bound has two spirals at the ends of the planks, but this spiral should be finer than the binder and made of either ebony or boxwood.  The width of each plank should be two finger-widths.
Their edges are about a finger's width, and their length is one and a half spans.  In the middle of the planks, there are two rods of the same wood, securely fastened to them.  Their length is half a span or a little more, and their width is about two fingers or a little more.  These two rods...
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals.  Image of another similar instrument, finer and lighter.
Made of ebony or boxwood, shaped like tongs, but with two rods at the end, as you see.  The length of each rod is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the cervix with it...
Have the woman sit on a bed, her legs spread apart.  Then insert these two rods, closed, into the cervix.  You hold the end of the instrument below between her legs, then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with tongs, to the extent you want to open the cervix. So that the midwife does what she wants; an image of another spiral, mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to break the head of the fetus.
It resembles scissors, with teeth on the end, as you see.  It can also be made rectangular, like tongs, in this form, as you see, with teeth like saw teeth for cutting and separating.
Image of a device also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so as not to break when pulling the fetus with it.  Image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these tools, the more varied their types and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his reputation among people.  Do not undervalue any tool, for you may need it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the delivery of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, one should instruct the woman to hold herself, then make her sneeze with the instrument, and hold your hand over her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, then do so; otherwise, take another measure.
Pierce a hole in the cover and place in it open herbs for the cervix, such as foeniculum, seseli, dill, chamomile, shih, silybum, and quassia, any or all of these.  Soak them in water and place on heat. Then place a silver tube over the hole in the cover, and the other end into the cervix.
Hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the uterus, then have her sneeze as we said. Then the placenta will be expelled quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in the grease of a she-camel or the saliva of a viper.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out slowly, little by little. If it is stuck deep in the uterus, insert the hand as described until finding the placenta, and then gently pull it out little by little.
So as not to dislocate the uterus with forceful pulling, one should gently move it to the sides, right and left.  Then increase the pulling force.  It will then respond and detach from the adhesion. If the cervix is closed, then we have described the treatment with sneezing, and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all the methods described, avoid force when pulling again.  Instead, tie what has come out to the woman's thigh near the cervix, then inject her with the four-part ointment.  It will cause it to fester after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out. However, if it festers, a foul odor will ascend from it to the stomach and head, harming the patient.  Therefore, the appropriate fumigant should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients tried the smoke of frankincense and dried figs.  A depiction of the apparatus used to fumigate the woman when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and the like.
It is made of lead, shaped like a funnel, or made of copper. The narrow end is placed at the vulva, and the wide end is placed over a fire.  Incense is placed on embers; it is held until it is gone, and then more is put in its place.
Chapter Seventy-nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated anus.
Many boys are born with an unopened anus, which may be blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or, if not, with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat it with ointments until healed.  If you fear that it will close up again, insert a lead tube into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
The anus may also be blocked by a scar or a tumor.  It is necessary to incise the scar tissue, then treat it with the remedies mentioned, including cauterization.
Chapter Eighty.
On treating warts that occur on the lower part of the body.
Warts that occur on the lower part of the body are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus, either externally or within the surrounding space, and may be present as a single or multiple lesion.
If this thickening becomes chronic, it may open and discharge a whitish watery fluid or thin pus.  Some of these warts may penetrate into the rectum and intestines; others may not.  Penetrating warts can be identified by what comes out with stool and flatulence when the patient defecates.
Perhaps worms may emerge from it.  Some warts, if located in the surrounding space, may penetrate the bladder and urethra.  Others may penetrate the hip joint and the tailbone.  A wart that penetrates the anus is also recognized as penetrating, regardless of its other characteristics.
Insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe, made of brass or iron, into the wart, if there is no deviation.  If there is a deviation, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.  If you feel nothing at all, and no stool, flatulence, or worms emerge from the opening, as we have mentioned, know that it is not penetrating, and proceed with treatment.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it, and the inability of the affected area to heal with medication.  If it penetrates the hip joint or tailbone, the sign is the probe reaching that location.
If there is no deviation to the bone, and pain persists in the vicinity, with constant discharge of pus, and if treatment and ointment application are ineffective in healing, these penetrating warts will never heal.
Treatment is futile for those who try to deal with them using the methods of ignorant physicians.  However, for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, healing is expected with the iron, as I describe, and as I have experienced.  The patient should lie on their back before you.
Raise his legs and tilt his thighs towards his abdomen. Then, insert a copper or lead probe if the wart has a deviation, so you can find where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has penetrated your finger completely, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrating.  Do not waste effort on it, as it will not heal, as we have said.
Some say it heals in some people rarely.  A useful treatment is to heat a thin cautery according to the size of the wart, as previously mentioned, and introduce it into the wart until it reaches the vicinity of the anus.  Then, repeat this two or three times.
So that you know that all the excess, hardened flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, has been burned. Then treat it with a thread soaked in oil until that burned flesh comes out. Then treat it with healing ointments, and if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.  If you insert the probe but it does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the wart just below the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the wart. While passing the incision with the probe in the wart, continue until the incision reaches where the tip of the probe ends. Remove and discard the probe. Then clean away that hardened flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If bleeding overwhelms you and prevents you from performing the cutting of the flesh, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a strong medicine.  Cauterizing with fire combines two beneficial effects: burning the excess flesh.
Cut the blood and dry the moisture. Then treat it with a thread soaked in oil or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the area becomes purulent and the burned flesh comes out in the pus.  Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of firm flesh.
These are the medicines that are astringent and drying.  If it heals, it is healed, and there is no need to return to the procedure. If the wart extends deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and search with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh and it is close to breaking through, then the only action is with hope and expectation.  Either cauterize it, as we said.
Or, cut it until you reach its bottom so you can insert the thread and treatment from close proximity.  Do not extend the cut too far, lest you sever the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to involuntarily pass stool. Then treat it as we described.  Perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or, penetrate that barrier and pierce it after you have cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with the probe or another sharp-edged instrument. Then clean away all of the congealed flesh in the cut as far as you can reach.
Then suture the entire wound, including the cut and the upper opening, until it is closed.  The wart may remain open within the anus, which will be less burdensome for the patient.  The wart may heal in this manner.
If, when you insert the probe into the wart and it is on one side of the anus, near the body surface, with the skin and the ring of the anus, then take a probe with a pierced tip, like a cobbler's awl, in this way.
And insert a thread, made of five threads or so, into it. Then insert the probe with the thread into the wart until you reach its bottom. If it is protruding from the edge of the anus from the inside, nearby.
Then pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling out the end of the thread. Tie the two ends together and leave it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, pull it firmly until the flesh between the ends of the threads is cut and falls out.  Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the wart is not protruding, make it protrude as best you can, but do not do this if it is deep, to avoid cutting the muscle. Then do as described until it heals.
The image of the pointed lancet, with which you cut the warts, should have a very sharp curvature on one side and a blunt side on the other, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids come in two types: either within the anus, resembling red swellings or like grapes, and they may be small or large, and blood continually flows from them.
They may be single or multiple, and some are external to the anus, near its edges. However, those external to the anus are, for the most part, less moist. Yellowish water, or a little blood, drips from them constantly.  They are the color of the skin.
For those internal to the anus, instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus is stretched.  The polyps will then appear, and you should quickly seize them with forceps or your fingernail, and cut them at their base, if the forceps do not remain held firmly on them due to their moistness and laxity.
Then grasp it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened linen, or pull it with your fingers, and cut it, then sprinkle some sharp powders on it after cutting, in order to act as cautery, or cauterize it as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the anus does not yield to stretching, administer an enema containing a little stinging substance to wash what is inside the anus and to quickly cause it to yield when the patient strains. As for the polyps external to the anus, their treatment is easy and simple.
Take it with your fingernail or forceps, cut it, and then treat it as previously described until it heals. If one dislikes cutting with iron, one should use a needle and thread.
Then pull the polyp upwards and pierce it with the needle at its base from the opposite side, wrap the ends of the thread around the needle, which is positioned across the polyp, and pull the polyp firmly.  Tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the polyps and leave one unpierced.
To cause the blood to flow, then apply a cloth soaked in rose or cypress oil to the anus, have the patient rest, and leave it until the polyps fall off.  Once they have fallen off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
As for treating fissures, they often arise from dryness and retention of waste.  If prolonged and remedies are ineffective, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or your fingernail until they become moist and the top layer that prevents healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, scrape it more vigorously than before, until it bleeds and is scraped clean, then treat it.  It will heal.
Chapter Eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and non-ingrown, dry warts, and the pimple.
The pimple is a rounded swelling the color of the skin, resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body, particularly on the soles of the feet and fingers, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to dissect around the pimple, grasping it with a lancet or a forceps, and to pull it out from its root. Then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it, as described in the relevant section.  As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, hardened, rounded protuberance on the surface of the body.
It often appears on children's hands. Its treatment is to stretch the wart, cut it, or pierce it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off.  If you wish, cauterize it as previously described with fire or a strong medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I have mentioned in the treatment of the pimple.  The pimple is also a small, hardened, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going quite deep.  If it is affected by cold, one feels a sensation similar to the sting of an ant.
It occurs throughout the body, mostly on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a tube made of strong goose or eagle feathers and placing it around the pimple so that the tube encircles it. Then, rotate your hand with the tube to break the skin surrounding the pimple.
And if you wish, you can do this with a brass or iron tube, in this manner,  placing it deep in the flesh and pulling the pimple from its root.
The top of the tube should be firm, twisted, and easy for the fingers to grasp and twist.  If you wish, cauterize the pimple as previously described for cauterizing warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the forms of instruments used for injections in diseases of the rectum, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, porcelain, or hollowed or hammered brass.  These instruments may be made in various sizes to suit those who use them. Those used for treating young children or those with narrow or painful rectums should be very slender.  Image of a large syringe:.
Its upper funnel, where the reservoir is attached, should be wide, with a partition to hold the reservoir as shown.  The lower tip, which enters the rectum, must be very smooth and perfectly rounded, with two holes on one side and a single hole on the other.
The hole should be the thickness of a reed, or slightly thicker.  The reservoir, in which the medicines are placed, is made of animal bladder or sheepskin, and should be small and approximately one span in diameter.
It is pierced with many holes, spiraling outward, with the distance between each hole about the thickness of a finger.  A strong thread of doubled yarn (approximately 10 strands), is then inserted into these holes to tie and gather the reservoir like a small mat. Once the medicine is placed inside, tighten the head of the syringe between the stones firmly, and then inject. This is an image of the reservoir and its holes.
The method of injection is to fill the bladder or skin pouch with the medication, warmed to the patient's tolerance, avoiding extreme heat or cold.  Then, the patient lies on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed beneath them.  The tip of the syringe is then lubricated with ointment, egg white, or licorice juice, or similar.  Gently, it is inserted into the rectum.  The attendant holds the reservoir with both hands, squeezing it firmly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowels.
Then, the syringe is removed, and the patient lowers their legs. If the medicine is prompting expulsion, the patient should hold it as long as possible. If the patient sleeps with it in all night, it is more effective for expulsion.  If it is used for diarrhea and the expulsion is rushed, repeat the enema until recovery.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very gentle, smoother than the syringes used for children.  This is an image of a gentle syringe with its skin drawn tight.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of surgical wounds.
I have previously mentioned in the classification the treatment of conditions similar to burns. Here, I describe their treatment with the hand and with medicines in full detail.  I say that surgical wounds differ according to the cause of the wound and the location of the injury.
The causes of wounds are numerous, such as striking with a stone, cutting with a sword or knife, stabbing with a spear, stick, or arrow, and similar things.
And the wounds, according to their location on the body, are like those on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.
And I describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a model and a principle for all other wounds.  I begin with the simpler wounds of the head, especially since the compound wounds will be mentioned in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture of the bone, then, if it is from a blow with a stone or similar, and only the skin is damaged, and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of a hot swelling, then quickly incise the wound with a lancet on the spot. Do not delay this, and release blood according to its strength, if nothing prevents the incision.  Especially if the blood coming from the wound is slight.  Let the incision be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and thick foods. If something prevents the incision, then let him reduce his food intake, avoid meat and drinks, and if a hot swelling occurs on the wound, apply a cotton pad soaked in rose oil, alone or with a drink that has a binding effect.
And if you fear a hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not altered it—the air I will describe to you shortly—; but if the air has altered it, apply some ointments to it.
Until the pus is discharged, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges do not come together by themselves, bring them together by stitching, as I will describe in the stitching of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its attachment is only in a small projection, cut it, then treat the wound with medicines to form strong flesh in place of the skin.  Tell the patient to eat foods that provide strength, such as heads of animals and similar.
If a wound in the skin has become putrid and is not attached to the bone, cut away all the putrid flesh and cauterize it, then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding, and the bleeding does not stop with medicines, search for the artery.
If you strike it and it does not stop, cut it with a lancet and tie it off. If the previously mentioned treatments are not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy; it is sufficient to sprinkle this powder on them, while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for the powder is: one part frankincense, two parts asafoetida, and three parts quicklime or un-quicklime.  Grind all together, sift, and fill the wound with it, applying firm pressure to ensure good adherence.
It will adhere to the blood, then compress it from above with bandages. Leave it undisturbed as long as it does not swell. The medicine will not be removed until it is healed.  Quicklime alone may achieve this effect if the frankincense and asafoetida are unavailable.
This action can also be performed on many larger wounds if properly applied and bandaged, and if the wounds are fresh and still bleeding, so long as the air has not altered them.  However, if the air has already caused some alteration, especially during the summer.
Therefore, using this powder is not the only effective treatment.  Apply some ripening ointment or a poultice of barley flour mixed with water and honey to encourage pus formation, then treat it with other methods until healed.
If, however, the wound involves a small fracture of the bone, pull it out with a cloth.  Treatment of head injuries is discussed in the section on neck injuries. If the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments that cause strong constriction, such as verdigris, alum, and similar substances, because they injure and spasm the nerve.
Never apply anything cold to the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use gentle remedies such as washed rose petals, repeatedly moistened with fresh water or oil, or rose and zinc ointments.
If also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and with moist ointments.  If the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with splints, and then treat until healed.
If the wound has a cavity and pus has collected at the bottom, drain it from the lowest point.  If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see blood flowing, tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary.
If part or all of the hyoid cartilage has been cut, but the vessels are intact, bring the edges of the skin together with sutures on the hyoid cartilage.  Do not touch the hyoid cartilage, but smooth and restore it to its natural shape, then tie it securely, and leave it for a number of days.
Then treat it with astringent and drying ointments until healed. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it. If there are bone fragments, remove as many as possible. If not all can be removed, leave it until the wound becomes infected and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powders we described. If bone in the wound becomes infected and forms a fistula, treat it as described in the chapter on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see a cavity, observe. If air comes out when the patient breathes, know that it is a fatal wound.  If there is no cavity and the wound is fresh with blood, do not initially use powders or tighten it, lest the blood be trapped in the cavity.
For it will recede to the heart and kill the patient. Instead, apply a drawing ointment twice daily. If no ointment is available, place a soft cotton in the wound to absorb the moisture.  Have the patient sleep with the wound uppermost.
To drain what gathers there. If three days or more have passed, and the patient shows no spasms, bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and their overall condition is good, know that the wound is healthy. Treat it with bandages and other remedies until healed.
If the wound cannot be seen, and the discharge persists, know that it has become a fistula. Treat it according to that section.  The patient should lie on the wound to drain what gathers there. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it according to the preceding description of suturing.
If it is large, or if small, if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, explore the wound and remove the fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them be.
Allow the wound to fester, as this will make removal easier.  The treatment of other wounds occurring in other parts of the body is governed by the principles we have discussed.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On wounds of the abdomen, and the expulsion and suturing of the intestines.
A wound to the abdomen may be large, small, or medium.  A large wound may expose intestines, or several intestines.  Returning and suturing them will be more difficult and arduous.
A small wound, too, may present another difficulty, making the return of the intestines more difficult. If the intestines are not promptly returned to their place, they will swell and thicken, making their return more difficult.  Therefore, the most favorable wound is the medium-sized one, because the return of the intestines is not as difficult as it is with these other two types.
Know that there are four methods for suturing the abdomen. Two are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and other bodily wounds, and the other two are specific, applying to all wounds but especially suited for suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation.  If the wound is small and something of the intestines has come out, and its return is difficult, it is either due to the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestines have been inflated by the cold air.
If this is the case, you should warm it by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, or water in which izhar, sa'di, and senbel have been boiled, and apply it to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
A drink with a constricting property may also achieve this, and is superior to plain water in resolving the swelling. If you see that the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestines with water in which khutmmi or khabazi have been boiled, as this will facilitate their return with ease.
If, after this treatment, its return is still impossible, make a small incision in the wound using the tool with which you would incise nostrils. The initial treatment, if successful, is preferable to incision, and incision is only resorted to when absolutely necessary and all other means fail. This is a picture of the tool.
Its one curved side is limited, and the other side is unlimited. The thin end is not as thin as a scalpel, but slightly blunt. It is a tool resembling a small saw, as you see. If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, their return should be to their natural shape.
Its specific location, if possible, is preferable. However, if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be higher than the lower body.
Likewise, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the surgical incision higher than the other side. This approach is also necessary for major and intermediate surgeries.
For smaller surgeries, place it as best as possible. Then, have a helpful assistant hold the entire wound in their hands, bringing the edges together, and then gradually revealing sections to the person performing the suturing.
This is a description of basic single-layer suturing. Take a needle or needles depending on the size of the wound. Leave a space on the edges of the wound equal to the thickness of a little finger. Insert one needle without thread into the edges of the skin. Using the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin, from the inside, so that it penetrates on that side. The edges of the skin and peritoneum have been brought together, forming four layers. Then, using a doubled thread around the needle, draw it repeatedly from both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly united.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger and insert another needle.  Tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue this process with as many needles as necessary to completely close the wound. Use needles of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick needles are also difficult to insert into the skin, therefore the needles should be of medium thickness.  The needle should not be inserted too close to the skin edge.
To prevent the flesh from tearing quickly and the wound from opening before healing.  Also, do not space the stitches too widely, lest the wound fail to heal. Then, cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient when sleeping, and provide a protective flap of linen fabric on each side to hold the needle ends.
Leave it until you know the wound has healed.  This method of stitching with needles is best suited for small surgical wounds, as they may be closed with just one or two needles, or thereabouts.
As for the method of stitching for the common type of wound, gather all four edges – the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum – in a single operation.  Use a needle with a thread of moderate thickness and then, after penetrating all four edges, bring the needle back out from the original entry point.
So that the thread is interwoven over the wound, producing a stitch like that used in securing bags.  Leave a space between each stitch equal to the width of a little finger. This is a stitch understood by everyone.
With this stitch, a surgical procedure was performed on a man whose abdomen was pierced by a knife.  The surgical opening was over a span of more than a span, and approximately two spans of the small intestine had protruded.  The wound was located in the middle of the abdomen.
He repositioned the intestines after they had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.  The wound healed in approximately fifteen days, and he was treated until he recovered.  He subsequently lived many years and functioned normally in all aspects of his life.  Physicians had previously concluded that he would never recover.
It is remarkable that I did not use any ointment, as I was in a location where there were no medicines available.  I simply applied used cotton to the wound twice a day and treated it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the specific types of stitching, I will cite Galen's text: Begin the stitching from the skin.  Insert the needle from the outside to the inside.  Once the needle pierces the skin and the muscle running straight along the length of the abdomen.
Leave the peritoneum's edge on the side where you inserted the needle.  Pierce the other edge of the peritoneum from inside to outside.  Then pierce that same edge of the peritoneum again, this time from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side. Pierce its other edge from inside to outside.  While piercing the peritoneum, also pierce the edge of the mesentery on its side until you have pierced through entirely.
Then, starting from the same side, trace the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side. Bring the needle out of the skin near it, then return it to that skin and trace the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side, along with the edge of the mesentery.
Bring it out of the skin on its side. Do this again and again until you have stitched the entire wound in this way.  In general, this stitching is like the stitching of a furrier for furs.
By stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the skin's edge, and leaving it once from the other side until empty.  As for the second special type of stitching, which Galen also mentioned, this is his statement verbatim.
He means that you should stitch it in the way some healers stitch, by bringing each part to its corresponding counterpart, naturally.  That is, joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the mesentery to its other edge, in the manner I describe to you.
The needle should be inserted into the mesentery's edge nearest you, from the outside, and passed inside it alone, leaving the edges of the peritoneum. Then, return the needle and pass it from outside to inside in both edges of the peritoneum, and then return it again.
And pass it from inside to outside in the other edge of the mesentery on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than the common, easy stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's statement verbatim. Some have said that a two-needle method can also be used to close the abdomen. This means to insert a single thread into both, beginning by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side; then insert the other needle from the opposite side, passing it back to your side, similar to the stitching of menders.
Know that if the tear is in the middle of the abdomen, its repair is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.  As for treating the wound, its treatment is like that of other wounds.  If you encounter the wound fresh with its blood, before the air changes it, and you have returned the intestines to their place and stitched and secured it, then apply the medicinal poultices.
If the wound has been affected by air, apply some available ointments until it suppurates, the sutures come loose, and the peritoneum and mesentery heal; then treat it like other wounds until it heals.
If you lack remedies, apply a poultice of worn cotton from the beginning of suppuration and change it twice daily, as I taught you, until it heals.  You do not need other treatment in most cases of simple wounds, unless you fear that the wound might cause the major organs to experience pain.
Therefore, it is necessary to dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his bowels, which often occurs, then irrigate them with a lukewarm, astringent black drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the bowels and has become a penetrating wound into them. Know that the thick parts of the intestines heal more easily, while the thin parts are more difficult to heal.
As for the intestines known as the jejunum, it will not heal from any injury that occurs in it at all, due to the abundance of its large veins, the thinness of its tissue, and its proximity to the nervous system.  But if the extruded part of the wound is a small amount and you catch it fresh, then return it according to how you would return any other part of the intestines.
If it has been some time and it has turned green or black, you should tie it with a thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, because there are veins and arteries in the protruding part. Then cut what is below the ligature.
And make the ends of the thread hanging from beneath the wound, outside of it, so that you can easily pull it and remove it when the protruding part falls off and the wound suppurates.  Describing the wound that occurs in the intestines, but if a small perforation occurs in the intestines...
For in some cases it may be possible to repair it, as I have seen a man who had a spear wound in his abdomen, to the right of the stomach.  The wound became chronic and a fistula developed, from which feces and wind were discharged.  I treated it, however, without expecting it to heal. I continued treating him until he healed and the area closed up.  When I saw the area had healed, I feared that the patient might suffer further harm in his abdomen. However, absolutely no such harm occurred, and he remained in the best possible condition. Indeed, he ate, drank, had sexual relations, bathed, and engaged in physical exertion without difficulty.  Some experienced practitioners have stated that if a small wound occurs in the intestines, it should be treated in this way.
This is to take large ants by the heads, then bring together the edges of the wound.  An ant, with its mouth open, is placed on the edges of the wound. When it bites down and closes its mouth, its head is cut off; this adheres and does not separate. Then another ant is placed near the first.
Continue doing this with several ants, according to the size of the wound.  Then, stitch the wound closed.  These heads remain adhering to the intestines until they heal, and no harm occurs to the patient.  It is also possible to suture the intestines with fine thread.
The method for extracting the adhering animal tissue from the Egyptian animal, after it has entered a needle, is to take the end of this thread from the animal tissue, and carefully pull it out.  Then, a thin, spun linen thread is tied to the end, and that thread is then inserted into the needle. The thread of the animal tissue is used to suture the intestines, then returned to the cavity.  This method of suturing with ants and animal tissue is only based on hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy and no cure at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the treatment of the common cold and nasal polyps.
Know that any wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic, old, and ulcerated, and if it continuously discharges pus without stopping, is generally called a nasal polyp (nasor) in any organ, and we call it a cold (zakaam) and nasal polyp.
It is, in fact, a hard, dense, white mass with no pain, having a cavity like the hollow of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather, and it is sometimes moist, constantly discharging pus.  Sometimes the moisture may cease, and this moisture may be copious, or scant, thick, or thin.
I have previously stated in the classification of surgical cases that any ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes; one is either a deficiency of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because of hard flesh inside and on its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. Or it is due to the ulcer being excessively harmful and unclean, or that the ulcer itself is putrid, and the substance discharging from it is of poor quality; or that the treatment is inappropriate; or that a plague-like sickness has spread in the region; or, lastly, it is due to specific local factors.
Or it is due to the ulcer being excessively harmful and unclean, or that the ulcer itself is putrid, and the substance discharging from it is of poor quality; or that the treatment is inappropriate; or that a plague-like sickness has spread in the region; or, lastly, it is due to specific local factors. As observed in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases and the healing of tumors are slow and difficult, or due to one or several bones being present; I have detailed all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medication in the classification.
Here, I must inform you about the treatment of fistulas and nasal discharge, which are treated manually. Know that fistulas may occur in all parts of the body; some lead to large veins, arteries, or nerves.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the numerous articulations, such as the hand and foot; and some lead close to a major organ or similar structure.
Those fistulas that follow this pattern are difficult to cure, and their treatment is arduous and fraught with ignorance.  If there are fistulas that do not reach these mentioned locations, I hope and anticipate success in their treatment.
To ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, probe it with this. If the fistula is winding, probe it with a thin lead probe, as lead is malleable.
If it enters and curves toward the winding path, if the fistula has numerous openings that the probe cannot locate, inject one of its openings. The moisture you inject will flow towards the other openings and drain.
Then, investigate in any way possible to determine if there is bone, nerve, or if the fistula's bottom is deep or shallow, or if it is a single fistula with multiple openings.  Ascertain all of this to the best of your ability through careful exploration and the patient's pain when you touch the area.
And similarly with the signs and causes of the swelling.  If you have established all of this accurately, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  Consider, if...
If the fistula is visible, close to the surface, or in a healthy location distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations I have previously described, then surgically incise the fistula as described previously, and remove any hardened material, putrid flesh, and excess tissue within.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its opening, until it heals.  If the fistula's opening is deep and in a straight line, you should incise it deeply as possible, and then clean it of all its putrid flesh.
Then, use a finely woven applicator to insert strong medicines into the fistula's depths, which you can discern with an instrument. Do this repeatedly until the strong medication consumes all remaining corruption within the fistula's depth.
Then apply ointments that promote the growth of healthy tissue until it heals. If it does not heal with this, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, probe and incise it as I have told you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein, nerve, or vital organ, as we have said, and the bone is exposed and has some corruption and blackness, remove the corruption until it disappears.  Then treat it with something that promotes healing until it heals; if it does not heal and the pus persists as it was before.
Know that you have not completely eradicated all corruption.  Expose everything affected again, thoroughly remove and cleanse it with all your effort, then apply a treatment.  If it heals, well and good.  If not, know that the corruption lies in a very deep recess, so expose it all again.
Thoroughly remove and cleanse it with all your effort. If the corrupt bone is small and you can pull it out, remove it with the delicate forceps suitable for that purpose.
If there are many bones, remove them all completely; do not leave anything behind.  If any ligaments obstruct them, and cutting them presents no risk, cut those ligaments and flesh if necessary, and expose the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones in your time, apply something to the wound to make it fester. Leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments surrounding the bones fester. Protect the wound, so that the opening you made in your work does not close up.
But if you fear that, apply a piece of cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments.  When those ligaments fester and the bones become loose, they will be easy to remove and pull out.
If it is a single large bone, such as a tibia or femur, and only the surface has become corrupted, thoroughly remove the corruption until the blackness and decay are gone, then close the wound.  If a large part of it has corrupted and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it must be scraped.
Cut it all the way to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it joins together. I am telling you about a case of a man with a diseased leg to use as an example and help in your treatment. This man was young.
Around thirty years ago, a man experienced pain in his leg due to a condition originating within his body, until the material reached the leg and caused a large swelling.  There was no external cause.  Then, time passed and the doctors made mistakes until the swelling opened.
A large amount of material drained from it, and the treatment was poor, so the leg became diseased with many open sores, all emitting pus and bodily fluids.  A group of physicians treated it for about two years, but none of them was skilled in the art of surgery.
Until they came to me.  I saw his leg, with a great flow of material coming from those open sores.  The man's body was wasted and his complexion yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those sores, and it reached the bone. Then I investigated all the sores.
I found that some of them connected to each other from all sides of the leg. So I cut open one of those sores until I exposed some of the bone, which I found to be corrupted, decayed, blackened, putrefied, and riddled with holes, penetrating to the marrow. I then reported what I had discovered.
I removed the diseased bone, and I believe that there was no other corruption in the bone other than what I had cut away and reported. I then used healing medicines to close the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.  Then I again exposed the bone, further than the first exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, and I reported what I saw of that corruption as well. Then I tried to close it, but it did not heal or join.  Then I exposed it again, and I kept cutting the bone piece by piece and trying to close it, but it would not heal, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
I extracted it with its marrow, then closed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of work and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness, their low tolerance, and my fear for their life.  Because they were constantly experiencing severe fainting spells due to excessive vomiting.  They recovered completely.
Strong flesh grew in the place of the bone, and their condition in their body improved. Their strength returned, and they managed their affairs.  They experienced no injury in their walking that harmed them at all. If a bone that grew in a place in the body had broken.
It is necessary to expose it in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone. Have someone pull it upwards. Use a second, thicker wool bandage.
Then tie it to the flesh under the bone, pulling the end to draw the flesh downwards.  Expose the flesh in the area you want to expose, so that the saw does not injure the flesh. Place a plank or board under the bone from below, securely.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the diseased bone.  The incision should be slightly above the area of disease, so that there is no disease within the bone cavity that does not appear on the surface, and you will not have to make the incision again.
If the bone is diseased but not protruding, and its parts are joined together, and the disease is in its center or in a part of it, expose the flesh from all sides. Then place the plank from below, then make the incision from the side where the disease is.
When finished with the incision, make another incision on the other side. Let the incision be a short distance from the disease, as we said. If the disease is in a joint, cut the diseased joint itself and make an incision in the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the disease is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than removing it. If the disease is in the hand or foot metacarpals, treatment is very difficult. However, you should scrape away the disease as it appears to you and remove and cleanse it in any way you can.
By any means that works for you, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve.  Know that the instruments, saws, and blades for cutting these bones vary greatly, depending on the bones' placement, position, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suitable for each type of work.
Know that the work itself can indicate the type of tool needed, if you have extensive experience and knowledge of the craft.  A master craftsman, having witnessed various illnesses, understands this. He may invent tools for each illness, and I illustrate various tools at the end of this chapter.
Make them examples to follow and use as a guide for others, God willing.  Image of a saw:.

Chapter Eighty-seven.
On amputating limbs and spreading bones.
Limbs may become putrid, either from an external cause or from an internal one.  If you treat this corruption with medicine and the treatment is ineffective, and you see the decay spreading through the limb, unchecked by anything.
Then it is necessary to amputate the limb to the extent of the corruption, so that the patient may be saved from death or a great affliction greater than losing the limb.  A sign of this affliction is that the limb will become black, as if fire had burned it.
Or, after turning black, it will fester and spread to the adjacent limb, affecting the whole body.  Proceed with amputation immediately, also if the cause of the decay is the sting of some venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and the like.
If the decay or sting is in the fingertip, amputate the finger; do not delay until the decay spreads to the hand. Likewise, if the decay has reached the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm; do not delay until the decay spreads to the arm.
Likewise, if the decay has reached the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow joint.  If the decay has spread to the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder, for that will cause the patient's death. Employ other treatments as your ability allows.
Likewise, do the same for the leg. If the decay reaches the toe, amputate the toe at one of the phalanges. If the decay reaches the foot, amputate the entire leg. If it reaches the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and submit the patient to death.  To amputate or dissect the limb, tie a bandage below the place where you intend to cut, and tie another bandage above the place.
One attendant pulls the lower bandage downward, another the upper bandage upward. You, with a broad scalpel, separate the flesh between the bandages until all the flesh is exposed. Then cut or dissect; be sure to place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct spot, causing the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling.  If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the spot quickly or apply some hemostatic agents, then return to your procedure until you are finished.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will give you an example of a similar affliction in a man's leg.  This is the very affliction I am describing; namely, there was blackness in his leg accompanied by a burning sensation resembling fire.
This decay first appeared in his toe, and it spread throughout his entire foot. The man felt compelled to remove himself from the affliction when he saw the decay progressing through the limb, along with the intense pain and burning. He amputated it at the joint, and he recovered.
After a long time, the same decay appeared in his index finger. He sought me out, and I applied all the remedies I could to the hand.  After cleaning his body, the decay did not stop, and it continued to progress to the other finger.
Until the decay spread to his hand. He asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to contain the decay.  I was also afraid that amputation would be fatal, as his strength was failing.  When he lost hope in me, he returned to his town.
I was later told that he ultimately amputated his entire hand and recovered.  I have related this story so that it might be a help in understanding and treating illnesses of this kind, and as a guide to be followed.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject medicines into them.
If a tumor develops in a fleshy organ and persists for a considerable time, then bursts or opens, discharging all the matter within, leaving the area empty like a vessel.
The skin over it, like a torn cloth, may become thin, but it has not advanced to a point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore, it deserves to be called an abscess, not a fistula, unless its duration extends to the point of causing damage to one of these structures.
In such a case, it is called a fistula or ulcer, and its treatment is to cut away all the skin, as it surrounds the area, particularly if it is thin and like torn cloth, and you are certain that it does not adhere to the affected area due to the damage.
If you anticipate the skin might adhere, and the damage has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, treat it with injections.  Observe the abscess; if it is large and the pus it produces has a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, in equal parts mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey, then take what you need of it, dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess.  Tighten the opening and leave the medicine within for about two hours.
Then, remove it by squeezing. Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  If this medicine is unavailable, it can be injected with ash water.  This involves taking ash from olive or oak wood, and pouring water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been cleansed.  If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject it with water and honey mixed with some powdered verdigris.
Or inject it with honey and drink mixed together, because honey cleanses and washes, and the drink adheres to the abscess, especially if the drink has a property of tightening and drying.  If you do this several times and are certain that the abscess's corruption has gone, then inject it with something that will promote the growth of flesh within.
For example, take some Palestinian ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and a astringent drink, or inject it with some other remedies and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments.  If the opening of the abscess is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to fit.
If it is narrow, widen it slightly with an instrument, or place a thread soaked in Egyptian ointment or Syrian ointment within it until it widens. Also, if the opening is wide, bring its edges together with stitches, leaving only enough space for the injection tube to pass, without excess.
Also, if the opening from which pus is flowing is elevated, make an incision at the lowest point so that the pus flows downwards, because if pus is injected into the depths of the abscess, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
If you are unable to cut the abscess downwards as you desire, then apply pressure to the limb so that the pus flows out easily, as best you can, and make sure that no pus remains trapped within it.
Regarding the joining remedies that are applied to the abscess from the outside, and how to apply them: take one of the joining ointments similar to what you desire, and spread it onto a linen cloth; let the cloth cover the entire abscess. Then, with scissors, cut an opening slightly wider than the abscess's opening, and spread some soft ointment onto another piece of cloth, sized to fit the opening. Place it on top, positioned a little away from the abscess's opening to allow pus to easily flow out. Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, the one applied over the abscess opening is the one you remove at all times, to allow the collected pus to exit, and to see if the fluid draining is abundant or scant, mature or immature.
Also, examine the abscess site itself; does the patient feel pain, or not? Is there swelling, or not?  If your treatment continues in this way, and you observe that the material draining from the abscess opening is minimal,
Know that the abscess has adhered, or is about to adhere. In that case, treat it again tomorrow, or on the third day. When you treat the wound, replace the cloths and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the abscess, do not despair of its adherence.
For his healing is near, because some people's wounds heal slowly, and others' heal quickly. If, after many days, unripe pus comes out of the abscess, know that it has not adhered.  If the abscess's adherence is delayed,
Then increase the drying of the medications, and let the medications be moist in consistency and dry in strength, like the palm ointment, if more galbanum is added to it. The best treatment is to use palm ointment.
It is treated by applying rose oil, then sprinkling moderate-strength old wine over it and mixing it with it. You can do the same if palm ointment is unavailable.  Honey, after being cooked until thick, can also be used.  Or, you can take myrrh, licorice, and kender, grind them, and sprinkle them over honey while it is on the fire. Then, apply it to a cloth and wrap it around the abscess, or apply the thickened cooked honey, sprinkle the medicines on it, place cloths over it, and bind it.
Long-stalked zeraun, iris root, asmanjounian, and kresna flour, and rue, used individually or mixed together, ground, sifted, and sprinkled over the described honey can be used.  If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it like a fistula as described above.
Eighty-ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of the inflamed and injured finger, the cutting of the superfluous finger, and the separation of the fused fingers.
Dahis is a profuse growth of flesh that arises beneath the toenail or fingernail, sometimes on other fingers. If left untreated, it grows into a swollen, inflamed tumor.
Or it may become corrupted and foul, even eating away the base of the nail, possibly destroying it entirely, and the corruption may reach the bone, causing a putrid odor and widening the end of the finger, turning it a dark color.  If treated as described in the section and your treatment is unsuccessful,
Then it is necessary to cut away all the excess flesh growing from the nail with a knife, and then cauterize the wound.  Cauterization in this case is very beneficial. If the bone and nail are sound,
If the corner of the nail has pressed the flesh inward, irritating and hurting it, a thin strip of material should be placed under the corner of the nail that is irritating the flesh, lifting it upwards, and the flesh should be gently cut away.
Apply the burning, corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the corruption has affected the bone, it must be cut away and removed, for it will never heal as long as there is corrupted bone.
If you see decay and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges as previously described, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is injured or bruised and severe pain develops, it is necessary to first apply a bloodletting treatment.
Then split the nail with a sharp lancet in a slanted incision from top to bottom, taking care not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, as this would cause severe pain to the affected area and may lead to the growth of excessive flesh in that spot.  Then treat the area to relieve pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows on some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or partly bony, or may have a nail, and some of it may grow from the base joint of some of the fingers.
Or it may grow on some of the finger bones, and those that grow on the finger bones themselves do not move, and those that grow at the finger joint may move.  Any that are purely fleshy can be easily removed; cut them at their base with a broad lancet.
However, those that grow at the base of the joint are difficult to treat, so avoid cutting them.  As for those that grow on the finger at one of the phalanges, it is necessary first to cut away the flesh in a circular manner around the bone, then to scrape away the bone with one of the appropriate chisels.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the fusion that sometimes occurs between fingers, this often happens at birth, or during the healing of a wound, burn, or similar injury.  In such cases, it is necessary to cut through the fusion.
So that the fingers return to their natural position.  Then place between them a cloth or bandage soaked in rose oil, so that they do not fuse quickly, and separate them, or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the area heals properly.
Likewise, if fusion occurs between a finger and the palm, cut through the fusion in a way that best restores the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
In the cutting of sinews.
Sinews are twisted, thick veins filled with black, dark matter, occurring in most body parts, most commonly in the legs, especially in the legs of porters, labourers, and carriers.  First, it is necessary to use vigorous rubbing of the body to remove the dark matter.
Then, bleed the sufferer at the basilic vein.  Treatment with iron is of two types: one, to cut and remove the dark blood; the other, to excise the sinew and remove it entirely.  As for cutting, the leg is first soaked in hot water.
Until the thick, turbid blood dissolves.  Then, the leg of the afflicted person is bound with a bandage from above the thigh to below the knee.  Then, the sinew is cut in one, two, or three wide cuts.
Then, remove the dark blood with your hand from the lower leg upwards and from above downwards until you remove the amount of blood you deem sufficient, or as much as the patient's strength allows.  Then, bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that produce dark matter, and repeat vomiting and bloodletting.
When the veins are filled and that harms the patient, and as for its excision, it is done in this way: The patient's leg is shaved if it has much hair, then placed in a bath, and the leg is soaked in hot water until it becomes red and sweats, or vigorous exercise is performed.
If a bath is not available to heat the limb, then the skin is cut lengthwise opposite the sinew, either at the end near the knee or at the bottom near the heel. Then the skin is opened with hooks and the sinew is scraped from every side until it is palpable.
When it appears, you will see it red and firm.  Once it is free from the skin, it will appear like a tendon.  Then, insert a probe underneath it until it rises and emerges from the skin.  Fasten it with a smooth, blunt hook.  Then, cut another incision near that one, about the width of three fingers.
Then, scrape the skin off the sinew until it is visible.  Then, lift it up with the probe as you did before and fasten it with another hook, as you did at first.  Then, cut another incision, or several incisions if necessary.
Then, remove and cut it at the end of the incision, near the heel.  Then, pull it and remove it until it comes out of the second incision.  Then, pull it towards the incision above it.  Do this until you pull it out from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions. Once all of it is out, cut it.
If pulling and scraping are not successful, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull.  Insert the probe underneath it and twist your hand in every direction until it comes out, taking care not to break it. If it breaks, it will be very difficult to remove.
Removing it all will cause harm to the patient.  Once removed completely, apply wool soaked in a potion and rose-oil or oil to the wound, and treat it until it heals.  If the abscess is tense, with twists and turns in various directions.
If it is not straight, as we said, it is necessary to make an incision on each side of its twists and turns.  Then, hang it with hooks until you remove it completely.  Take care, when making incisions, not to cut or injure the sinew, as this will make its removal difficult, and take care with all your effort.
Image of the incision used for the abscess.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a hook like other hooks, nor should its end be sharp so as not to injure the sinew.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, because if it is thin, its thinness would cut the sinew.  Rather, it should have an advantage of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
In the treatment of the civilian tendon.
This tendon arises in the legs in hot countries like al-Hijaz and the Arab countries, and in hot, sparsely populated countries, and it may arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, originating from a festering that occurs beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms, and the festering of the gourd, and the worm that develops between the skin and flesh, and a sign of the beginning of this tendon's occurrence is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area becomes swollen, then the tendon begins to emerge from the location of that swelling.
As if the root of a plant or animal, and when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams, and tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it extends a great deal, cut some off and wrap the rest, but do not cut it from its origin before it is all out, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a tumor, festering, and an undesirable ulcer at the site.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it gently and pull it out little by little until the last part emerges and nothing remains of it in the body.  Sometimes, this tendon can be as long as five or ten cubits in some people.
I have heard that it has emerged from a man as long as twenty cubits. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a reed into its hole and press it firmly against the body for a long time, until all the material within it is discharged. Then, try to treat the affected area with medicines for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This tendon may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or the leg itself, producing many openings from which branches emerge. Treat it as we described in the division and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On the incision for the worm that develops beneath the stomach, called the "cow's ailment.
This illness is called "cow's ailment" in some of our countries, because it frequently affects cattle. It is a small, single worm that develops between the skin and flesh, crawling throughout the body, both upward and downward.
It becomes apparent to the touch as it crawls from one limb to another, until it pierces the skin in a certain location and emerges. Its formation comes from the corruption of some humors, like worms, snakes, and the growth of gourds in the abdomen.
The danger from it is that if it crawls within the body and rises to the head, reaching the eye, it might rupture it and cause its loss. This often occurs.  Therefore, if you wish to treat it and remove it, it should be done when it is crawling and visible to the touch.
Therefore, one should bind tightly above and below it with a strong bandage, then make an incision over it and remove it. If it has burrowed into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply a cauterization with fire to the area until it is burned out.  The greatest danger is its potential to damage the eye, as we have stated.
If you see it has reached the head near the eye, bind tightly under it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it.  The patient should maintain a regimen of purifying his body with laxatives for corrupt, foul humors, and be cautious about foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-three.
On the incision of the disease known as the "nafar".
This disease, called "nafar" in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs and then spreads from one organ to another.  I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was summoned to a woman ill in a certain countryside.  She uncovered her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of her arm. After an hour, I saw that swelling crawl up her forearm, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as mercury.
If it travels from one place to another, the pain disappears from that location and settles in the shoulder.  Then, after an hour, it spread throughout the rest of the body, eventually reaching the other arm.  She then told me that it was circling her entire body, as I observed.
I was astonished by the speed of its transfer from one organ to another.  I had not previously witnessed this disease in this form with my own eyes, although I had seen others where the pain moved from one organ to another. But I had never seen it in a woman as I saw it in this woman.
I attributed this only to the fact that the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and exposed veins.  Therefore, this moving sensation was apparent to the touch.  It should not manifest in this way among those of comfort, whose bodies are moist and whose veins are hidden.
If you wish to treat it, and the sufferer feels pain, if it appears visibly as we described, then firmly compress above and below it with speed, and cut open the area until that confined wind is expelled.
If you do not see it, treat it by shaking the body and dispersing the winds, such as rotten seed and  skabinj seed, and similar medicines.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places on the body where they are lodged.  Regarding their differences by type, some are large, some small; some are hollow glass, some solid glass; some have three angles, some four.
Some have tongues, some have shards.  As for those that differ according to the organs they lodge in, there are two types:  Either the organs are major hollow organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow strikes one of these organs, and you see the signs of death that I will describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting the arrow, for death will usually befall the patient. And if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and injures the membrane covering the brain, then severe headache, dizziness, and fainting may result.
And if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and injures the membrane covering the brain, then severe headache, dizziness, and fainting may result. Redness in the eyes and tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting, and perhaps bleeding from the nostrils or ears.  Perhaps speech is lost, and the voice gone, and a white, porridge-like moisture may emerge from the wound, and liquid like meat juice flows from it.
If these signs appear, then refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow if it has not already been removed.  As for the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is close to the left breast and you feel it as though it has lodged in something solid rather than empty.
And perhaps the arrow has a movement like a pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.  Know then that death is inevitable.  And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels adjacent to the neck swell, and the patient's complexion changes, breathing becomes labored, and he craves inhaled cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the small ribs, and breathing will be heavy with intense pain.
And he sighs and all the muscles of the shoulders move.  If the arrow strikes the liver, intense pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may emerge from the wound.
And his condition is obvious. If the arrow strikes the abdomen, becomes lodged, and something of the stool, or of the intestines or bowels, is discharged from the wound, there is no hope for treatment nor for extracting the arrow. If the arrow is lodged in the bladder and urine is discharged.
If something protrudes outwards and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for other organs such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are mostly spared.
Unless the arrow strikes an artery or nerve, and unless the arrow is poisoned, I will tell you something I have witnessed concerning these arrows so you might draw upon it for your treatment.  An arrow struck a man in the root of his nose, at the bridge of his eye.
I extracted it from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered without harm to his eye.  I extracted another arrow for a Jew that had struck his earlobe, under the lower eyelid; the arrow had disappeared, and only its small tip, which attaches to the shaft, remained.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with square, smooth iron, and no ears. The Jew recovered without harm to his eye.  I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arab.
It had ears, and I split it open between the windpipes; it had pierced his throat. I gently worked at it until I extracted it. The Christian was spared and recovered.  I extracted another arrow from a man's abdomen, and we thought he would die from it.
After about thirty days, or thereabouts, without any change in his condition, I split the arrow and worked at it, extracting it. He recovered and suffered no further harm. I also saw a man with an arrow in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then, after seven years, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh.  I saw a woman with an arrow in her abdomen; the wound had closed over it, and the arrow remained.  Her condition did not change, and she experienced no problems with her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face; the wound had closed, and he experienced little pain.  Many such cases exist. I extracted an arrow from a Sultan's officer who had been struck in the middle of his nose, slightly deviated to the right side.
The arrowhead was completely gone.  I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck.  I found the arrow wound very narrow.  I probed it with a thin probe and felt nothing.  He was experiencing a prickling and pain under his ear on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was from the arrowhead, so I dressed the area with a poultice that promoted drawing out and maturation, hoping the area would swell and show a sign of the arrowhead so I could open it.  But nothing happened to indicate the arrowhead had reached that spot.
I continued applying the poultice for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound eventually healed, and the patient despaired of removing the arrow.  One day, he felt the arrow inside his nose, so he informed me.  I then applied strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, feeling the thin arrowhead, which was stuck to the wood.  Then, I increased the application of the strong medicine to open the wound further until the arrowhead was visible.  I was with him for about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I could insert forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it would not come out.  I continued to gently manipulate it with various instruments until I grasped it firmly with precise forceps, as their depiction is found at the end of this chapter.
The physicians had judged that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it.  The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, with no further problems.  I am telling you how to remove some arrows so that you can use this as a model and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description or encompassed by a book.  Instead, the skillful artisan measures the little by the much, and what is present by what is absent, and devises a new method and a new instrument for unusual cases.
If I descend from this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the members they entered in two ways: either by pulling from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, which is the way out of where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding into fleshy tissue, and it is pulled out.  If it does not come out at its time of impact, you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh rots and its removal is easier.  The same applies if it has lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for several days and try pulling and moving it daily. It will come out. If after several days it still does not come out, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from all sides with a fine awl until you widen the space for the arrow and then pull it out.
If the arrow has lodged in the skull bone and has penetrated one of the brain ventricles, and some of the symptoms I mentioned have appeared, then refrain from pulling the arrow out and leave it until its condition improves after a few days.
Then proceed with pulling out the arrow. If it is deeply lodged and does not come out easily, use the awls around the arrow as described. Then treat the area until it heals.  However, if the arrow has concealed itself in some part of the body, and it is hidden from sight, search for it with a probe.  If you feel it, pull it out using suitable instruments. If you are unable to remove it due to the narrow wound and the deep penetration of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way.
then widen the wound until you can grasp the arrow and remove it.  If it has two prongs, grasp them and remove the flesh that has become entangled in them, from all sides, using every possible technique.  If you are unable to remove the flesh, break the prongs and twist them until you release them.
When attempting to remove the arrow from any location, use twisting motions with forceps in all directions to extract it. Be extremely gentle, so the arrow does not break, making it harder to remove. If you are unable to remove it after some time.
Leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh around it becomes infected, then try again; it will then be easier to remove. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in the relevant section.  Take great care to avoid cutting any veins, nerves, or tendons, and employ all possible techniques.
Use every means possible to remove the arrow, with gentleness, patience, and firmness, as described.  When pulling the arrow out, it is best to position the afflicted area in the same posture it was in when the arrow was lodged.
If that is not possible, use whatever method you can.  As for an arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either something of it will protrude outward, or you will feel the arrowhead near the surface of the skin, protruding.
Make an incision over it, large enough for the forceps to grip, then pull it out; it will be easier to remove. If it is lodged in bone, twist your hand in a circular motion to impact the arrow and enlarge the space for it to emerge, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for several days and try again until it comes out.  If the arrow's shaft remains, push it out with it. If the shaft has broken off and you wish to use a pushing instrument, insert a hollow instrument into the arrowhead's shaft, and then push it out using that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out using an instrument that fits into the hollow.  The arrow will thus be easier to remove. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the flesh affected by the poison if possible, then treat it appropriately.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, then incise, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.  Image of forceps used to extract arrows:
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted like a file, so that if it grasps an arrow or anything, it will not let go.  Different sizes, large, small, and medium, can be made, depending on the size of the arrow, the size of the wound, and its width.

This is solid, like a rod, so that it can easily enter a hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-five.
On the opening of veins.
The veins commonly opened in the body are thirty. Sixteen of them are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *ḥassisīn*; the two arteries in the temples, visible; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as the *nāẓirīn*.
The vein that stands up in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, the two veins in the neck, the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, the two veins in the lower lip, and these veins known as the *jayārak*, and the two veins under the tongue.
The veins opened in the arm and hand are five. One is the *qayfāl*, which is on the outer side; the common people call it the vein of the head. The *akḥal*, which is the middle vein, is composed of a branch of the *bāsaliq* and a branch of the *qayfāl*; the common people call it the vein of the body.
The *bāsaliq*, which is located on the inner side, is also called the *ibṭī*; the common people call it the vein of the abdomen and the cord of the arm. It is located on the *zanad* (the forearm), where it attaches.  It is the one that clearly emerges above the thumb, and the *ʾasīlīm*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, having two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins. One is located below the bend of the knee, on the outer side; the second is the *ṣāfin*, located near the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the *nisā*, located near the heel on the outer side.
In the other leg, there are three veins like them.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, scabies, and chronic, stubborn head sores; and their opening will be as I describe.
To do this, shave the patient's head and rub its back in the area of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well.  Then, the patient's neck is bound with a turban until the veins appear behind the ears in the low parts of the head.  Feel for them with your finger, and where you feel a pulse under your finger, mark the spot with ink.
Then take a scalpel, which is known as a lancet, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then lift the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin cleanly, making the cut approximately the length of two clenched fingers.
Or as much blood as desired is drawn.  Then, the vessels are tied with ligatures and left until healed.  In the beginning of the book, the cutting and burning of these vessels was discussed.  As for the arteries in the temples, their opening is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, chronic eye inflammation, and sudden, severe eye discharge.
Their opening, as I describe to you, involves binding the patient's neck with a turban until the veins become clearly visible and their pulse is felt under your finger.  At that point, mark the spot with ink.  Then lift the skin above the vein using your index finger.
Insert the lancet from below, lift the vein upwards, and sever it as you did with the other veins.  Draw off the amount of blood needed.  Then, loosen the patient's neck binding and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then place a pledget and a ligature on it, and tie tightly from above.  Leave it until it heals.  Their mention, cutting and draining was discussed previously in the beginning of the book.  As for the opening of the forehead vein, its benefit comes after the opening of the temporal veins for chronic facial ailments such as sores, ulcers, and chronic redness.
Its opening, as I describe to you, involves binding the patient's neck with a turban until the vein appears.  Then, take the instrument called the lancet.  This is its image:
Place the pointed end of the lancet on the vein, and strike from above with a mallet or similar object. Allow the blood to flow as desired. Then, release the patient's neck binding and apply a bandage until it heals.
It can be opened with a broad lancet, but it should not be as sharp as other lancets, rather, it should have a slightly broad tip.  Open it by twisting, because the bone is close.  A narrow lancet may break there.
As for the veins near the eye sockets, they are beneficial for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, and other facial diseases.  As for their opening, the patient should bind their neck with a turban.  Then, open them while standing at the patient's head. The incision should be slightly oblique, lengthwise, with a narrow, slightly broad lancet.
If the area has little flesh, a narrow lancet may break. Then, draw the required blood, place a bandage on them, and bind them for one night.  Then, remove the bandage.  As for opening the nasal vein, it is beneficial for severe fevers.
Severe headaches, and facial diseases such as the red swelling that appears on the nose, especially if chronic, are also treated by opening the veins.  To open the vein, bind the patient's neck, hold the patient's nose with your left hand, and take a long, narrow lancet.
Insert it into the middle of the nostril itself, between the nasal septum, in a straight line, because the vein is not apparent there to the touch.  The blood will immediately appear.  You should press the lancet in slightly, draw the needed blood, then bandage it for one night. It will quickly clot.
As for the jugular veins, opening them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and black humoral diseases that appear on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, and bad sores and ulcers.  Their opening is performed by binding the patient's neck beneath them with a bandage, and the surgeon stands at the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then the vein is opened lengthwise, with a somewhat wide incision. Then, draw a moderate amount of blood, or as much as needed.  Then do the same with the other vein, and then untie the bandage.
Pull the veins with a moderate pressure so the patient does not suffocate, and leave it until the next day. Then the wound will heal.  As for the veins of the cheeks, opening them after opening the cephalic vein is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, bad sores, chapped lips, and bad sores.
(Those) which are in the nose and around it.  Their opening is done by having the patient sit in front of you, tying their neck with a turban, then turning their lips and looking for the veins; one is seen to the right of the lip, the other to the left.  Note their darkness.
Also, there are thin, dark veins around them.  Cut them cleanly off. If it is difficult and you are unsure what they are, aim for cutting the largest and most obvious ones.  Likewise, do the same with the veins on the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, opening them after opening the cephalic vein is beneficial for the constrictions that occur in the throat from diseases of the palate and diseases of the mouth.  How to open them: have the patient sit before you facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein. Their color will be dark.
Open them, but be careful not to cut them deeply, for there are arteries beneath them, and excessive bleeding might result from those arteries.  As for the three veins that are opened at the elbow, these are the ones customarily opened among people. Opening them can be done in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, comfortable lancet, or with a lancet of a knife type (the incision),  [and this is its image]. Image of the wide, comfortable lancet:
It should be wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins containing thick, dark blood.  And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening thin veins containing thin, yellowish blood.  And this is the image of the incision lancet:
This incision lancet, suitable for cutting, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the width or narrowness of the veins.  One can infer other things from this, and it is well-known among artisans.
As for the jugular vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from the chest and abdomen.  The phlebotomist must be cautious when performing the incision, and be careful of the underlying artery, as if he errs and deepens the incision, he will sever that artery.
This will cause bleeding, therefore it is necessary that its incision not be made with a lancet for piercing, but rather an incision with the incision lancet.  If the jugular vein is not clearly visible, one must avoid it and turn to another vein or seek out a branch of it.
Or you may incise the arm's vein instead, for it is clear, and cut it with the incision lancet, as we have said. If you wish to incise it directly, it is necessary, before tightening the arm, to palpate the area in order to identify the pulse point, and then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and incise the vein with an oblique incision with the incision lancet, as we said, and take care that the blow be distant from the artery. When you see, upon tightening the bandage, a puff in the area you marked with ink, that puff is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood during the phlebotomy surging like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood. In that case, immediately place your finger upon it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it will often stop, then tighten the arm.
Leave it be, and warn the patient against neglecting it.  Let it be on a bandage and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop, and you are overwhelmed, and no remedy is available to you at the time, sever the artery if it is visible to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will cease.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, take one half, and tie it firmly over the vein with bandages and splints until the next day. If the blood stops, then do so. Otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned application of sharp cauterizing devices for the bleeding. Stopping the blood flow is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the firmness of the bandage on the arm, understand this.  As for the dark vein, the benefit of its incision is to draw blood from the top of the head and lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, as we have said.
The phlebotomist should be careful with his incision, for there are nerves beneath.  If he increases the depth of the lancet's incision and strikes a nerve, numbness will result, which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all. This nerve is often palpable.
If in some people it is hidden and thin and cannot be seen, then your incision should be a shallow cut with a lancet, and avoid the nerve as best you can.  If the vein is between two nerves, make a lengthwise incision of the vein. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and if you wish to incise this vein, it should be done with incisions using the olive-shaped lancet or the broad rue-shaped lancet, as it is the safest of all veins because it has neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, when making the incision, you should avoid striking the head of the muscle with the lancet, and seek the soft spot.  If it is not struck on the first attempt, it will not be harmed if incised again multiple times. However, it may swell in some people if not incised on the first try.
But that swelling will not harm it.  As for how to perform the incision, its symptoms, and what should be done to repair it, first you should know that phlebotomy is used either for maintaining health alone.
Or, it is used for diseases. The one used for maintaining health and preventing diseases should be done on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the acubal, and the basilic.  The incision should be performed at the beginning of spring, when signs of fullness appear.
The incision should be made on a Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of daylight have passed.  As for the incision used for diseases, there is no fixed time, but whenever needed and necessary, whether it be night or day.
At any hour and time.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should elderly people who have passed sixty years.  If someone intends to perform phlebotomy for any reason...
He should cleanse his intestines before the incision with a gentle enema if there is a lot of retained phlegm, so that foul impurities from the intestines are not drawn into the veins during the incision, harming the main organs.  A feverish person, a drunkard, and a person under the influence of alcohol should not be bled until these conditions have passed.
Further, phlebotomy should be avoided following dysentery, vomiting, fever, excessive sexual activity, exertion, exercise, late nights, fasting, and everything that weakens the body or mind.  Then, if the blood is thick, one should consider thinning the humors beforehand.
By means of foods, drinks, and medicines, if possible. Then he should take a bath, if there is no impediment, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood is thinned.  He should perform the incision in the middle of the day, as we stated, and aim to clear his chest that day of all bad psychological symptoms.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all bodily ailments such as excessive fatigue and exhaustion, sexual intercourse, and the like.  He should prepare his surroundings with items people typically use, such as fragrant herbs, perfumes, and amusements, to the extent possible for each individual.
Then the phlebotomist should sit on a higher cushion than the patient, then extend the arm and rub it with his hand two or three times, then tighten the bandage with the ligature and twist it two or three times. The tightening should be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either excessive tightening will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.  Then, after the tightening, the patient should rub his hands together.
Until the veins swell and are clearly visible to the touch.  Then the phlebotomist should wipe the lancet with a small amount of old oil, specifically. Then he should place his left index finger on the same vein slightly below the spot where he wants to make the incision, so as not to injure the vein. Because some veins are like tendons; they retract during phlebotomy. Others are filled with air, so when the lancet is placed on them, they recede beneath the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein.  If it does open the vein, it will only be a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be sure and careful in all of these matters. Then, he should lower the lancet; if the vein opens on that first attempt, then good.  Otherwise, he should try again slightly below or above that spot, quickly if the area hasn't swelled up.
If the patient swells or complains, leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, as it may cause a hot swelling.  He should not enter a bathhouse.  Then, if he wishes, he can have the phlebotomy repeated.  If the lancet penetrated and the opening was small, and the flow of blood was thin.
And fearing that not the desired amount of blood will be released, reposition the lancet in the same puncture, gently and straight, and enlarge the opening slightly.  Do this quickly before the area swells, as in many people, the area may swell with a small opening.
If you see it has swollen, do not repeat the procedure on it at all, for it will not help you.  Apply some clarified oil to it.  It facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this area than oil itself and other ointments as well.
Use clarified oil in all your phlebotomies when blood flow is difficult.  The specific remedy (and the other one) may also do this if applied to the spot; the blood will become thinner and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the phlebotomy site, which often happens, especially in someone who has not been bled before or whose vein opening was small, quickly apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the swelling and bandage it for an hour.  It will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood has completely exited the vein itself, or another vein.  If any discoloration, black or green, remains in the area after a few days, it does not harm.  If you wish, apply some poultices of gum arabic and aloe mixed.
Or something from the juice of the fūdinj and the like.  A swelling and protuberance often occur when phlebotomizing the basilic vein.  Place your hand on it. If you find it pulsating when you press on it, that is a bad protuberance, so beware of applying any of the things we mentioned.
For it might bleed arterial blood.  However, bandage it with something constricting to solidify the area, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.  One should extract blood from each person according to their strength and the prevailing color of their blood.
If the blood is dark, let it flow until it turns red.  Similarly, if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins.  Likewise, if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness subsides.  It is appropriate for those who are strong and full and require a single, immediate bloodletting.
To widen the vein's incision, and make the lancet wide.  Conversely, for the weak, narrow it, and make the incision in stages.  The opening should be narrow. The best instrument for venesection is one that is angled, slanted, or slit, not pointed.
This type of venesection is free from bleeding and cutting nerves. It is better and safer than venesection across or lengthwise.  If someone experiences fainting during venesection, it is necessary to give them something to eat before the procedure, such as bread soaked in pomegranate juice or vinegar.
If he is feverish and blood is drawn three or four times, if he has a cold temperament, then let him eat bread soaked in pomegranate juice, or honeyed drink, or perfumed with spices, or a fragrant herb drink before the venesection.
If fainting occurs during venesection and is due to excessive blood loss, then he should be given meat broth and a thin herbal drink.  Perfume with rosewater should be used, and the chest should be rinsed with it.  Use all the methods mentioned in the section on fainting.
If the venesection is for expectoration, and if someone wishes to relieve their arm and release their blood a second time, then for someone whose venesection was for copious expectoration and whose strength is weak, the blood should be released little by little, according to their strength, over several days.
And if someone wishes to relieve their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do so after seven or nine hours from the first venesection.  And if someone wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side from where it has accumulated, then let them be relieved on the second or third day.
And if a person has a lot of blood in their body, which has become hot and intense, causing fever, then blood should be drawn in one single, large quantity, and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs, after having carefully considered all the conditions for venesection. And to place your hand on his pulse while the blood flows, so that death does not occur in place of fainting, as this often happens if the surgeon is ignorant and carelessness occurs.  And this should not be done if you intend to release the arm and draw the blood again.
If the opening of the vein has closed and the blood is difficult to draw out, then vigorously probing it or twisting it forcefully is very bad.  Rather, either leave it until it can be opened again, or use the scalpel blade to remove the clotted blood from the opening of the vein.
Or apply something of salt dissolved in water, or something of the antidote *al-fāriq* or *al-shaxznāyā*, and gently probe it until the blood flows.  If the vein has become swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity requires drawing blood again, then either draw blood above that spot, or draw blood in the other arm or from another vein.
As for drawing blood from the arm's vein, it is used as a substitute for the *akhl* and *bāsiliq* veins if these are unavailable or hidden, because it is composed of both of them.  The method for drawing blood from it is that the patient should immerse his hand in hot water until the forearm turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible. Then tie it with a bandage a little tightly, with moderate pressure.
Then draw blood from the vein a little off center, neither across nor lengthwise, and make the opening wide.  Make the incision slightly above the wrist joint.  If the blood is difficult to draw, re-immerse the hand in the hot water basin and allow the blood to flow into the water.
Until you have obtained your desired amount.  If it is summertime, you may dispense with re-immersion in the hot water.  Most often, drawing blood into hot water is done in winter.  Drawing blood from this vein is safer than from any other vein. Because there is no vital vein or nerve beneath it.  As for drawing blood from the *asīlim* vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method for drawing blood from it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no vital vein or nerve beneath it.  As for drawing blood from the *asīlim* vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method for drawing blood from it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very apparent to the touch.  Then draw blood from it, a little off-center.  Even if you sever it completely, it will not harm him.  Be cautious; do not use the lancet too forcefully.  Below it lies the nerve of the fingers, and the area is bare of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And allow the blood to flow. If you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and will cease to flow.  When you have removed the desired amount of blood, apply grease and salt to the vein to prevent rapid clotting.
And likewise, this must be done with every narrow branch.  As for the benefit of drawing blood from the left hand, it is beneficial for spleen ailments.  You should perform this procedure in the same way as you did for the second vein.  As for drawing blood from the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body, such as ailments of the uterus.
And amenorrhea, kidney ailments, chronic sores of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.  The method for drawing blood from it is to immerse the leg in hot water and apply rubbing until the veins become dilated. Then tie above the joint of the leg with a bandage. The vein is located near the heel, visible near the big toe.
From it, many branches extend throughout the leg.  Draw blood from the widest branch, or near the heel where they join, for this is the best and safest approach. If you draw blood on the front of the leg, be cautious of the nerves located beneath the skin on the front of the leg.
Make your incision with a twisting motion as if you were about to sever it, and the lancet should be sharp. If blood does not flow readily, return his leg to the hot water and allow the blood to flow until it is emptied. If the surgeon misses the vein on the first attempt.
Then reposition the incision slightly higher, for the location is safe, and no harm need be feared if the nerve is avoided, as we stated.  Do likewise with the saphenous vein on the other leg. As for the femoral vein, its location is, as we said, near the heel, on the outer side.
Its benefit is for hip pain, if it is due to hot blood. The method for drawing blood is to have the patient enter a bath and accelerate the process.  Tie the leg from the hip to above the heel with a thin, long bandage, with four fingers width of the bandage.  Only then will it become apparent.
If it appears, draw blood in any case, though twisting is preferable. Alternatively, sever it by cutting or slitting; its location is safe.  In most people, it is very hidden, if you cannot find it.
If it does not appear at all to the touch, draw blood from a branch of it, which appears on the back of the foot near the little and ring fingers.  Avoid the nerves and draw off the amount of blood you desire.
Then loosen the bandage, place a piece of cotton on the incision site, and bandage the area tightly.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-six.
On cupping and its use.
Cupping vessels can be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass.  Cupping can be done in two ways: one with a mark/incision to draw blood, and the other without a mark.
This cupping without a mark is also twofold.
Cupping of the sides of the neck, both sides, and the chin cupping, below the lower jaw of the mouth, and shoulder cuppings, and sacrum cupping on the tailbone, and elbow cuppings, which are the middle of the arms, and leg cuppings, and heel cuppings.
Cupping draws blood from the thin, dispersed veins within the flesh.  Therefore, it does not deplete strength like venesection.  Cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used in any disease of fullness until the entire body is emptied.
If cupping is needed, whether for a disease or habitually, we use it at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
For some people, when blood increases to the point that cupping is needed, they experience heaviness and headaches in their head.  Some have fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.  Some have itching in their face, temples, and darkness and heaviness in their eyes. Some scratch the area where they were cupped.
Some laugh excessively. Some find the taste of blood in their mouths, and their gums swell and they spit blood. Some sleep excessively. Some see blood, redness, slain men, and wounds, and similar things in their dreams. Whenever we see any of this, ...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours have passed of the day.  The benefit of the “quick cupping” is for heaviness in the head and water that flows down to the eyes.
However, this should be after the body has emptied itself, and this cupping can be a substitute for venesection of the temples.  Caution should be taken that those who are cold-headed or have a cold should not use it, as it would greatly harm them.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their head should not use it, and those who habitually use it will be afflicted with forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cupping instrument slightly to avoid the onset of forgetfulness.  As for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for venesection of the temples and the veins of the eye.
Therefore, it is helpful for asthma, shortness of breath, tearing of the respiratory system, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the shoulder should be slightly elevated, because if it is lowered, it will generate weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is helpful for pains in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, constriction, and pain at the roots of the teeth. It is a substitute for venesection of the veins of the eye. The cupper should be instructed not to insert the instrument deeply to avoid cutting an artery and causing bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it is helpful for sores in the mouth, gum disease, and similar diseases in the mouth.  It may take the place of venesection of the veins in the lips.  As for cupping the shoulders, it is helpful for palpitations resulting from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the forearm, it is helpful for what venesection of the three veins—the veins of the eye, the temples, and the veins of the throat—is helpful, because it draws blood from all those delicate veins in the flesh and draws those delicate veins from other, thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press too hard with the instrument, because the area lacks flesh and has nerves and arteries beneath.  As for a single cupping on the coccyx, it is helpful for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower parts.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, brass cupping vessel, because the area needs strong suction, and glass cupping vessels may break.  A considerable amount of pressure should be applied.  As for cupping the legs, it clearly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and is helpful for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it causes menstruation and is helpful for boils and abscesses; it acts as a substitute for venesection of the groin and foot. However, it greatly exhausts the body, and fainting occurs in most people.  Cupping of the foot is similar in its benefits to cupping of the legs.
The method of applying cupping is to first place an empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction.  Do not prolong the application of the cupping vessels, but rather apply and remove them quickly to draw the humors to the area evenly.  Repeat this process until the area turns red and opens.
When the redness of blood appears, then apply pressure and resume suction gradually.  Then, observe the condition of the body.  For those with thin, porous flesh, a single application of pressure is sufficient to prevent the area from becoming ulcerated.
The cupper should widen the pressure, deepen it slightly, and adjust the suction with gentle, controlled movement. If the blood is thick, then pressure should be applied twice; the first time to open a path for the thin and watery blood, and the second to remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, then apply pressure a third time to achieve the desired result.  Generally, if one wishes to remove a small amount of blood, a single application of pressure is sufficient.  If a large amount of blood is desired, more pressure should be applied, especially if the blood is thick.
The pressure should be deep. The moderate limit for pressure is the depth of the skin only. What ointments should be used when applying cupping, and what water, and what should the cupper beware of?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin and tight pores...
The areas for cupping should be anointed with opening, softening, and dissolving ointments.  In summer, examples include the ointment of Khārizmī, violet ointment, sweet almond ointment, or pumpkin seed ointment.
However, in winter, examples include narcissus ointment, lily ointment, chamomile ointment, or hyacinth ointment, and similar ones. If the excess is thick and cold, use the ointment of marjoram, nightshade, frankincense, or fennel, and similar ones.
If the cupper has open pores and soft flesh, then ointment should be avoided.  These individuals should wash their cupping marks after the procedure with rosewater, cold water, grape vine water, pumpkin water, or similar waters.  And those whose blood is excessively moist...
They should wash their cupping marks with vinegar, or with rue and sumac water, and similar things.  And if their excess is thick, they should wash their cupping marks with old wine, marjoram water, fennel broth, or chamomile broth, and similar things.  Cupping should be avoided during and after bathing.
Instead, it should be used an hour or two after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and leech-applicator should consider before and after cupping.
First, one should consider whether the cupper or leech-applicator is bilious, with their blood tending towards sharpness and inflammation.  Then they should take cooling foods like pomegranate, chicory, vinegar, endive, and squill, and similar things.  Their food should be poultry, lamb, and similar stews.
And if their temperament is cold, they should be given honey-water and miya-water or bizury-squill water, and they should consume moderate fragrant wine, between old and new.  They should be given little food, and their diet should consist of poultry, canaries, sparrows, and doves in stews.  On the day of cupping and leeching, the drink should be more plentiful than the food.
Sometimes, some people should be given Faruq's antidote or musk medicine or shiltha before cupping and before or after leeching, to strengthen the main organs and thin the blood.  However, feverish people should not be given it.
As for cupping without a specific condition, these are the cuppings placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and groin.  These organs do not tolerate a condition being placed on them.  Rather, they are intended to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping on the breasts in cases of running nose, or we use it to dispel cold air that has settled in an organ, like placing a cupping on the abdomen and navel.  It loosens the organ, warms it, and relieves pain by resolving that air.
It may be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stones there, as its strong drawing power might open the blockage or dislodge the stones from their place.  Likewise, it does this when placed on the liver and spleen, when there is trapped air within them.  These cuppings can also be used empty, by suction only.
It may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water in cases of abscesses.  This means filling a large cupping with hot water alone, or water in which some suitable herbs have been boiled.
Then it is placed full on the area, held, and removed, repeated as needed.  This is the image of the cupping used with fire.
Its mouth opening is two fingers wide, as depicted, and its depth is half a span.  On one side, near the middle, there is a small hole just large enough for a needle to enter, made of thick Chinese or brass.
Its surface is smooth, flat, and polished so as not to injure the organ when placed on it.  In its center is a cross-shaped protrusion of brass or iron where the candle is placed with fire.  This cupping can also be made larger or smaller depending on the illnesses.
The user must be skillful, as cupping for children and thin individuals is different from cupping for strong, healthy adults.  As for how to place this cupping with fire on the area, one takes a wick of strong linen or a small candle of pitch and places it on the center of the hardened rod in the center of the cupping.
So that the fire ascends upwards towards the bottom of the cupping, to avoid burning the patient's body.  Then, it is placed on the area, and the finger is placed in the hole we mentioned, so that when holding the cupping, we do not need to remove the finger.
Then, steam will emerge from that hole, and the cupping will be released on the spot.  The wick is then relit as needed.  However, a cupping used for water-filled sores does not have a hardened rod or a hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the area only.  This is its form.
The larger the cupping, the more water it holds, the better.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On the application of leeches.
Leeches are used most often on areas where cupping cannot be applied, either because they are small, like the lip, gums, and the like, or because the area is lacking flesh, such as the finger and nose, and similar parts.
How to use them: Choose leeches from clear, unpolluted freshwater, and leave them in fresh water for a day and a night so that they are hungry and have nothing left in their bodies. Then the body is first bled by venesection or cupping, and then the afflicted area is treated.
Until it turns red, then the leech is placed upon it. When it is full, it will fall off. If possible, drawing the affected area with a cupping vessel is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and it is a oozing, then dampen a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it over the area until the oozing stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered alum or a similar astringent on it until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of beans on the area.
Leave it until the beans adhere to the area, and the bleeding will stop.  If further leeching is needed, do not re-use those leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then the area should be wiped with fresh blood.
Or pierce the area with a needle until some blood is drawn, then place a leech. If it senses any blood, it will attach to the spot. When you want it to detach, sprinkle some powdered licorice, salt, or ash on it and it will fall off at that spot.
Chapter Three.
On Fractures.
This chapter also contains what is needed in the art of medicine, namely the setting of fractures and dislocations of the bones.
Know, my sons, that many ignorant physicians and laypeople may claim expertise in this chapter, those who have never examined the writings of the ancients on it, nor read a single letter from them.
For this reason, this branch of knowledge is lacking in our country, and I have never encountered a skilled practitioner in it. But I have acquired what I have of it by my extensive reading of the books of the ancients and my diligent effort to understand them, then by dedicating myself to experience and practice throughout my life.
I have presented to you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. My experience has been applied to it, after I have brought it closer to you, clarifying it of its lengthy aspects, shortening it to the utmost brevity, explaining it to the fullest extent, and depicting for you numerous images of the tools used in it.
This is further elucidation, as I have done in the previous two chapters.  There is no power except from God, the Most High, the Supreme.
Chapter One.
In this chapter are summarized and collected matters concerning the breaking of bones. Before we begin to describe broken and dislocated limbs one by one, it is appropriate to mention some general statements and sections at the beginning of this chapter. This will first compel you, and anyone else eager to learn this noble craft, to understand and grasp its true meaning.
Therefore, I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall occurs, one should first hasten to reduce the displacement or loosen the parts, or both. Unless prevented by factors such as weakness or the affected person is a child or very old person, or if the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, his diet should be restricted to cold legumes, poultry, and venison.  Drinks, fatty meats, and overeating, and any food that causes excessive blood flow to the veins, should be avoided until the swelling subsides and the possibility of further discharge to the affected area is minimal.
Then, the patient should return to his usual regimen.  If the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should eat nourishing, dense, and viscous foods such as barley, rice, marrow, and beef tripe. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and similar foods, will hasten and improve the healing of the fracture.  Know that fractures in strong men and the elderly will not heal to their original state.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones,  fractures in bones that are extremely flexible, like those of young children, may still heal, but nature forms a glue-like substance around the fractured bone, thick and binding, holding the fragments together.
Holding them together until they reach their original strength and security, so that nothing hinders their function.
Therefore, the patient's diet should consist of strong, viscous, and thick foods, as mentioned.  Know that fractures vary by the affected body part, as a fracture in the leg is different from one in the head, and a fracture in the chest from one in the back.
So too are all other parts different from one another. We will discuss each type of fracture in detail in its own section, and the type of bone fracture may also vary within itself.
Because the fracture may be a simple cracking without splinters, or it may be lengthwise with splinters and detached or non-detached fragments.  The fracture may be accompanied by a wound and skin tear, or be a slight crack.
Each type has a specific method of treatment, which will be explained in detail in its place.  Signs of a fracture include its crookedness, swelling, visibility to the touch, and creaking when pressed by hand.
If there is no visible distortion, creaking, or discomfort when palpating the bone, and the patient experiences little pain, there is no fracture, but perhaps a contusion, a minor fracture, or a slight crack.  Therefore, the affected area should not be moved by pulling or probing at all.
Instead, apply suitable medications to be mentioned later, then gently bind the area.  Understand that when a bone is fractured in two without splintering, each part has separated from its counterpart.
You should promptly realign and straighten it before a hot swelling develops. If a hot swelling occurs, leave it for several days until it subsides, then realign it using any gentle method you can.
Know that realigning and straightening a bone is easier than one with splinters.  Then it is bound as will be described later. If the bone has splinters, the fractured limb (hand or foot) must be stretched from both sides.
Either by your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both ropes and hands. Position the limb on a level surface in its natural shape.  Once the fractured bone parts have been stretched, then gently and skillfully return those protrusions to their proper places.
Strive diligently to cause no pain or suffering to the patient through your actions.  Do your utmost to join the two bone fragments together in the best possible position.  At that time, you should touch and feel them with your hands. If you find anything out of place, correct and straighten it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and forceful prodding, as many ignorant people do, and often cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb with such actions.  I have witnessed this repeatedly from their actions.
After alignment, careful treatment, and binding, keep the limb still and quiet. Warn the patient not to move it during waking hours, sleep, or when turning over, getting up, or excreting; in short, during any movement.  Ensure the limb is in a position that prevents pain.
If the patient feels pain or discomfort in any position, he should change the position to one that does not cause pain.  Furthermore, the position should be straight and level.
So that if the limb is straightened, it will not become crooked.  Now, as for how to bind a fractured limb, as I describe to you, know that fractured limbs vary in size, shape, and condition.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar parts, . . .
The bandages should be soft and gentle for smaller limbs, like the arm and fingers.  For larger limbs, such as the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be broad and firm.  A wide bandage is needed for a larger limb, to bind it evenly and firmly on all sides, without any gaps.
Then, after completing the alignment, apply the appropriate plaster. Starting with a soft, gentle traction on the fracture site, then bandage the fracture site itself three or four times, depending on the limb's needs.  Lightly tighten the bandage, then move it upwards from the fracture site.
Tighten the bandage less than the tightening of the fracture site, and then gradually move the bandage away from the fracture site, gradually loosening the tension, until the bone is in a good, correct position. Then take another bandage, and wrap it also around the fracture site.
Wrap it several times. Then move the wrapping down to the lower part of the fracture. Maintain the tension and looseness of the wrapping as described for the first wrap (the upper part). Insert soft padding or cloth between the wraps to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is misalignment, do not insert anything. Otherwise, wrap another bandage around it, and then apply firm splints over these wraps, provided there is no swelling or inflammation of the limb.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to relieve the swelling and reduce the inflammation. Leave it for a few days, then apply the splints firmly at that time. The splints should be made from wide, flattened reeds carefully prepared, or from ebony wood.
Made of pine, palm fronds, or similar readily available materials, such as papyrus.  Ensure each splint is the same size and shape.
However, the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others.  The length of the splint should be appropriate for the size of the fractured limb.  Image of the splint:
Then, tighten the splints with another bandage, as you did initially.  Tie securely from above with strong threads, ensuring the tightness is especially focused on the fracture site. The tightness should decrease the further away from the fracture it is.
The threads should be of medium thickness, and preferably made of damp linen.  Threads made from twisted linen strips, as some ignorant practitioners do, are a serious mistake, as these are too thick.
Because the tightness is then uneven, and thin threads are also unsuitable, as they don't provide the desired tension.  The gap between splints should not be less than a finger's breadth.
If the patient is irritated by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, place soft padding, such as soft wool, underneath to prevent any discomfort.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin is perforated, we will discuss this separately.
Know that not every fractured limb needs to be splinted from day one.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five, seven, or more days later, depending on your assessment of the risk of developing a fever-inducing swelling.
This is a description of the dressings used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains. It is a concise, general dressing that sets bones and is suitable for most temperaments, particularly children and women, as it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
Take the flour dust, the fine particles that adhere to the millstones during grinding. Knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white, forming a dough that is neither thick nor thin, and then bake it.
Another dressing for fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  Take ten dirhams each of mastic, frankincense, acacia, raisin, gum arabic, and gypsum. Take five dirhams each of myrrh and licorice, and twenty dirhams of acacia. Finally, take twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients together and mix them with acacia water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  This dressing, well-combined, will quickly set broken bones and is suitable for most people due to its balance.
Another dressing useful for fractures and sprains:  Take ten dirhams each of gum arabic, mastic, and white cumin. Take five dirhams each of myrrh and licorice, six dirhams of acacia, and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all together finely, sift, and knead with water or egg white, then apply.
A dressing for dislocated joints and bones, relieving pain and for bone splitting and fractures:  Take prepared wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the affected area.  This dressing does not have the strength to set a fracture.
However, it is excellent for relieving inflammation and pain, particularly. Another dressing for setting a broken bone: Take unripe fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, grind both together, and apply as a poultice. A further, concise dressing to be used when a bone is broken.
To resolve the remaining swelling, take the root of cumin, chamomile, violet, and poppy seed—one part each. Grind all together and mix with a poultice if the limb is not inflamed; if inflamed, mix with coriander water or water and apply.
A stronger dressing for resolving a hard swelling after a fractured bone: Take the root of cumin, flax seeds, fenugreek, rosemary, marjoram, violet, and chamomile—one part each.
Grind all together and mix with dill water, fresh water, or a poultice, depending on the heat of the limb and the cessation of its heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that this should be applied to a fractured limb during setting.
Except for the cerate made of wax and oil, nothing else.  He described it as being of medium thickness.  As for Galen, he believed that things with dryness and some heat, such as myrrh, mastic, and frankincense, and the like, should be applied to the fractured limb during setting.
A dressing for weakness and pain: Take poppy seeds, chickpeas, shaved human hair or bird feathers, cumin, and salt—equal parts. Grind, sieve, mix, and apply as a dressing.  Regarding the amount needed to keep the ligament...
Then it should be removed; observe. If no pain, rubbing, or movement of the fractured bone from its place occurs, do not remove it for many days. However, if severe rubbing, troubling pain, or swelling occurs in the area,
Then promptly remove it immediately and do not delay.  Remove the dressing. Then take a soft cloth or damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the itching and pain subside. Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight to relieve the hot swelling, reduce limb swelling, and alleviate the pain.  Then, return to gentle stretching and a light bandage, do not apply the initial tightness.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all symptoms have completely disappeared, and the bandage and stretching are needed, then redo it as you did at first, in the same manner. If nothing of what we have mentioned happens to the limb.
Then do not remove it until after three, four, five, or seven days.  Sometimes it can be left for twenty days. All this depending on the condition of the limb as we mentioned, until the fracture is firm and the flesh is healed.
In that case, increase the tightness of the bandage further than the initial tightness. Also increase the strengthening of the patient's diet, as previously mentioned. If you see that the fracture site has become too dry and wasted more than is necessary, know that the nourishment is not reaching it.
Then apply lukewarm water each time you remove the bandage, every three days.  Ease the tightness of the bandage slightly.  By doing this, nourishment will reach the limb and it will heal quickly.  As for what the ignorant among those who set fractures do, of breaking the limb again...
For if it is not properly set the first time, and is set crookedly, then it is a mistake made by them, and a great deception. Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it. I have seen no trace of it in any of them. The correct approach is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
Concerning fractures of the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their forms diverse, and their causes varied.  Some fractures are caused by sword blows, and these may extend completely to the peritoneum beneath the bone. Like the way a carpenter works on wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a carpenter's fracture.  Alternatively, the sword may have cut only part of the bone, leaving only one side fractured, and not penetrating to the end. This type of fracture is called a simple fracture, and the wound from these fractures may be large or small.
Some fractures are caused by contusions or abrasions, resulting from a blow with a stone, a fall on a stone, or similar.  These fractures may extend to the membrane beneath the bone or be superficial.
The wound from these fractures may also be large or small.  Some fractures are hidden within the bone, barely perceptible, a slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  A fracture may also result from a fall or a blow from a stone or similar object, causing a portion of the bone to sink inward, creating a depression, much like a piece of copper that is struck and a portion sinks inward.
This is most common in the cranium of young children.  All these types of fractures can have detached or non-detached fragments. We will discuss the treatment of each in its place, and we will identify all these types of fractures through examination.
Inspecting them with probes and removing putrid flesh. The hairline fracture is identified by examining the bone, rubbing and staining it with ink, where the fracture will appear black.  Treatment of the fracture first considers the patient's symptoms.
If you see obvious symptoms that suggest danger, such as vomiting bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach or treat the patient, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and hope for the patient's recovery, then begin treatment.  If the injured person comes to you in the initial stages of the injury, especially in the winter.
You should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, in any case. If it is during the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone deteriorates, causing the symptoms we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and bruising, you should remove the crushed and bruised portion, as I am describing to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the nature of the wound and the patient's condition. If, during the exposure of the bone, you see bleeding or a hot swelling, address these accordingly.
Fill the area with cloths soaked in rosewater and ointment. Dress the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding ceases. Then, proceed to the repositioning and extraction of the bone, using one of two methods of procedure.
One method is to cut the bone with a thin, narrow blade, and this is its image/illustration:.
Then, use another cut, slightly wider than the first, and this is its image/illustration:.
Then use yet another cut, wider still than the second.  You should have a set of different blades, some wider than others, some shorter than others, and all with extremely sharp edges.  Let them be made of Indian steel or good quality steel.
Use gentleness in striking the blade so as not to dislodge the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and hard, you should first pierce around it with drills (called non-immersed drills).
Because they do not penetrate beyond the bone of the skull, as the drill has a rounded edge below its sharp head, like a ring or small circle, which prevents it from sinking in and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should have many such drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that for each skull you have a drill whose sharp tip is of the appropriate length and shortness for the thickness of that skull.  These are illustrations of three types. Of drills, large, medium, and small.
As for how to drill around the fractured bone, position the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you feel the bone has been penetrated.  Then move the drill to another location, leaving a space between each drill hole the thickness of a reed or similar.
Then cut between each pair of holes with the saws, using as much gentleness as possible, as we said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or with another instrument you have prepared for this purpose.
Such as spatulas and fine forceps.  Care must be taken that the drill or saw does not touch the peritoneum.  If you have smoothed the bone and separated it from the peritoneum, if it was attached, and removed it, then it should be cleaned.
Smooth any remaining roughness on the bone with another instrument similar to a saw, but it should be finer and more delicate than the other saws.  If any small bone fragments or splinters remain, remove them gently with your available instruments.
Then treat the wound afterwards with compresses and ointments as will be mentioned.  The other method of treatment is quite straightforward, free from risk, praised greatly by Galen.  This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lens-shaped saw beneath it.  This is its image:.
The lens-shaped part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything.  The sharp part is at the ends, extending lengthwise as you see.  The lens-shaped part rests against the peritoneum and the sharp edge of the saw is on the bone. Then strike the saw from one side.
With a small hammer, so that you cut through all the bone gently, as it revolves.  You are safe from injuring the membrane; absolutely no frightening incident will happen, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and timid person, indeed, even if he were asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off using the tip of the lens-shaped saw itself, and remove it gently.  It will come away without injury or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not penetrate the membrane, and the broken part of the bone was its surface, remaining with roughness and small fragments, then you should remove that roughness and those fragments with small chisels of various sizes, so that you can use the most suitable one for each place, according to what the work requires.
The broken bone and its shape must be kept in mind.  You should first use the widest of those chisels to scrape the bone, then use a narrower one after that, and continue in this way, successively using narrower and finer ones.
As for the other small, hairline fractures and slight breaks, each one should be treated according to what will lead to its repair.  This is something that is not obscure to anyone with even the slightest knowledge of this craft, and who has considered what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If, after removing the bone, the membrane remains exposed, you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening. Then take another cloth, folded or triangular in shape. Soak it in rose water and oil, place it over the first cloth, and do this as gently as possible to avoid placing undue weight on the peritoneum. Then, use a wide bandage on top and tie it, but only as much as necessary to hold the wound together.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two, until the inflammation subsides.  Then, remove the bandage and use afterwards the drying medicines such as iris roots, caraway flour, kender powder, and za'warand, and the like.  Make pills from these medicines.
And sprinkle them, as they are, dry, onto the wound. In general, use a medicine that cleanses but does not sting.  Strive to keep the wound clean during treatment, free from excess grease, dirt, and pus, and do not allow any pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the brain membrane, it corrupts and putrefies it, causing a great affliction to the afflicted, and this can occur in the membranes of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and if the afflicted person exhibits the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he is doomed, without fail.  If the discoloration was caused by a medicine applied to it, and if the medicine's potency was to produce such discoloration,
Therefore, take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them thoroughly, and apply the mixture to a cloth.  Then place the cloth on the membrane and treat it with the necessary remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a fractured nose.
Know that only the upper nasal bones, either both or one, can break, because they are bony. The lower portion is cartilaginous and does not break; rather, it is subject to bruises, curvature, and lacerations.
If one of the nasal bones is broken, the little finger should be inserted into the nasal opening.  Straighten the fracture from the inside with your index finger, and from the outside with your thumb, until the nose is restored to its natural shape.  Do this gently, taking care not to cause further pain to the patient.
If the fracture is high up on the nose and the finger cannot reach it, it should be straightened using a blunt, slightly thickened instrument.  If the fracture is in both sides, do likewise.  He should hasten to set it on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day, once the acute swelling has subsided, insert a thread of linen into the nasal opening if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if the fracture is on both sides.
The threads should be thick enough to fill the nasal opening.  Some earlier surgeons recommended soaking the threads in ghee and changing them daily.  However, I do not agree with this.  Instead, the threads should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the threads until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.  After the threads are in place,  goose feather tubes may be inserted into the nasal opening, wrapped with soft linen.  This will hold the nose fracture more firmly, and ensure the patient can still breathe.
This is not essential.  You may do it if you wish, or you may use the threads instead. If, during your treatment, a hot swelling appears on the nose, bandage it with qirūṭī or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or a diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling develops, then bandage the outside with semolina flour and powdered kandar mixed with egg white, and then place a soft bandage over it.  Do not tie the nose at all, especially if the nose bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it splintered, it should be cut and removed using the appropriate instrument. Then sew the opening and treat it with ointments that promote healing and inflammation. If a wound occurs inside the nose, it should be treated with threads and lead tubes used. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On setting the lower beard if it is broken.
If the lower beard is broken, and the break is not accompanied by an open wound, if the break is only from the outside and has not been fractured in two pieces and has curved inwards, then its recognition is easier.
If the fracture is on the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted, and gently lift the fracture hump from the inside to the outside.
Your other hand, from outside the bone, controls its alignment. If the jaw fracture has broken into two pieces, then traction must be applied from both sides in a straight line, until alignment is achieved. If it has occurred in the teeth, it will regenerate.
Or if it has separated, bind what you expect to remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread. Then, place a bandaged pad on the broken beard, then place a folded cloth over the pad, and put a large, tight bandage or a piece of leather of equal length to the beard over the cloth. Then tie it from above as you deem appropriate to bind and hold it together, so it does not break.  Instruct the patient to rest and refrain from exertion.  Give him soft, easily digested food. If you suspect any change in shape in any way, resolve to undo it on the third day.
Then tie it from above as you deem appropriate to bind and hold it together, so it does not break.  Instruct the patient to rest and refrain from exertion.  Give him soft, easily digested food. If you suspect any change in shape in any way, resolve to undo it on the third day. Then repair the bandage with flour dust and egg white, or with semolina flour, after removing the bandage.  Place a soft cloth over the dressing, and as long as the dressing remains adhered and the bone's condition has not changed, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  This fracture often strengthens in three weeks. If, during that time, a hot swelling appears, use the remedies we previously mentioned to soothe it until it subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by an open wound, if a fragment or fragments of bone have become detached, carefully remove those fragments using instruments suited to the task.  If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a surgical scalpel as needed.
Then, once you have removed the fragments and nothing remains, suture the wound opening if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the suitable ointments. And close the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of a fractured clavicle.
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front, near the acromion.  The fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits into two without splintering, which is the easiest to set;
or the fracture may have splinters, making it more difficult to set; or the fracture may occur with a wound. If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one to hold the arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other to pull the neck in the opposite direction.
Then adjust the fracture with your fingers until it is properly aligned, without any protruding edges or irregularities. If you need to pull more, a ball of linen or wool should be placed under the patient's armpit.
Adjust the bone as needed, pulling and raising the clavicle and pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you are unable to draw the end of the clavicle outward because it has sunk inward, the patient should be placed on their back.
A moderate-sized cushion is placed under the patient's shoulder, and the assistant presses the shoulder downward to elevate the deeply sunk clavicle.  Then correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a piece of the clavicle has fractured and is moving, you should gently separate and remove that fragment. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, use one of the prepared cutting tools to remove it. After placing the instrument that protects the diaphragm (which is made of wood or iron) under the clavicle, this is its image:.
It resembles a spoon, without any ornamentation. Its width should be adjusted to the size of the bone, and its length according to the task. It should have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound you made to extract the bone fragment is wide and there is a risk of inflammation, close the wound edges with stitches. If the wound is small, or if you fear a severe inflammation, suture the wound with sutures in proportion to the wound's size.
If there is a risk of inflammation, soak the wound in rosewater and vinegar or a similar liquid and apply it.  If the bone is dislocated, without a wound or incision, apply a dressing made of mill dust mixed with egg white to the bone. Place a soft splint over it, then place a cushion under his armpit if needed.  Take a very long bandage, about a span or so wide. Apply a folded bandage to the splint and dressing. Then take a splint made from a thin board. Make it three fingers wide and the same in length. Wrap it in a cloth, then wrap that cloth with the splint into the bandage section over the fracture. Then wrap the bandage around the fracture tightly. Secure it around his neck and under his healthy armpit, and under his injured armpit.  Repeat on each side, as you see that the tightness will properly hold the fracture in place, which is something you should know.
The whole point is that the splint should not be removed from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligaments loosen and you see the splint has shifted, correct it and tighten the bandage.  Then, have the patient sleep on their back, and place a small cushion under their armpit at night.
To elevate his arm from his side, so the clavicle fracture is elevated with the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling develops within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Maintain the pressure and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is set and consolidated, and it strengthens further over twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
Concerning the setting of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures in its broad area, rather it is its bony prominences which fracture.  So whenever a part or the middle of it is fractured, this is only discernible by palpation.  Then according to the nature of the fracture, apply a splint.
Set it and restore it to its natural shape by any means possible. Then apply mill dust, egg white, and soft linen bandage over a folded cloth pad, and then apply a wide splint of wood.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder, or slightly wider.  If there is a protrusion under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth that protrusion with soft linen until the splint is even. Then secure it from above with a long bandage.
Apply a firm bandage and secure the splint so that it does not shift from its position.  Inspect the bandage daily; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it moves from its position.  The patient should lie on their healthy side.  The shoulder heals in twenty days.
For a period of one to twenty-five days.  If this period is complete, remove the bandage, and you are safe, as it is one of the bones for which shattering or displacement is not feared. If a piece of bone protrudes and is irritating the skin, cut it and remove it. Do what has been mentioned in the case of a fractured clavicle to relieve any inflammation that may occur.
Chapter Seven.
On the setting of fractured ribs.
The chest can fracture in its middle, though this is infrequent.  Its extremities, however, are more prone to fracture and splintering.  If the middle of the chest fractures, the symptoms include tilting downward, severe pain, and difficulty breathing and coughing.
There may also be blood spitting, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes evident to the touch.  To set it, the patient should lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulders.  Then, their sides should be pressed, and the ribs gathered together by hand from both sides.  Care should be taken to adjust them smoothly on all sides possible.
And maintain this until the bone returns to its proper shape. Then apply bandages and splints, placing a splint made of thin wood from poplar or willow or similar lightweight material on top, after wrapping it in cloth. Then, carefully secure the bandage around the fractured bone so it does not loosen.  Wrap the bandage around the back, making turns, and tighten it firmly.  Then, check the bandage frequently, tightening it whenever it loosens.
If the need arises to remove it due to inflammation, pain, or swelling in the area, promptly remove it, and take off the bandage, correcting any such problems with the appropriate treatment. Then, if you deem it appropriate, reapply the bandage. Apply it and maintain the pressure until healed.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of broken ribs, know that ribs fracture primarily in the thick parts adjacent to the back and their front ends.  Injuries occur because they are cartilaginous.  This is easily detectable by feeling with the fingers.
Set the fracture by aligning the broken ends with your fingers until the shape is correct; then, bandage and support the fractured bone with a splint if needed. If the fracture is inclined inward, it will cause severe pain for the patient.
And the pain is like that experienced by someone with a hernia, because the bone pierces the diaphragm and also causes shortness of breath, coughing, and heavy spitting of blood.  This is a difficult condition to treat, and early practitioners used many methods to address it.
Some said that the patient should eat foods that cause flatulence and wind, to inflate the abdomen and push the fracture outward.  We reject this, lest it exacerbate or cause inflammation.  If inflammation has already begun, this will only increase and confirm it.
Some said a cupping glass should be placed on the area and pressed firmly.  This seems reasonable, but it is feared that the cupping will draw excessive fluids to the weak area. Others said that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The ribs are supported, filling the space, so that the ligament is level when wrapped around its circumference.  Then the patient is treated for a hernia with diet and medication. If the condition is severe, it cannot be tolerated. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, it is necessary to cut open the area, expose the fractured rib, and then place the instrument that protects the peritoneum (which has been described previously) beneath it.  Carefully cut the bone and remove it.
Then, if the wound is large, we bring the edges together with stitches and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If a hot abscess develops during this time, immediately apply rose-oil compresses to the area.  Also, treat the patient internally with something to reduce the swelling.
He should lie on the side on which he sleeps more easily until healed.
Chapter Nine.
On setting fractures of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if they are fractured, this is rare.  More often, they are injured.  The same applies to the vertebrae of the back.  If this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will heal or not... Look then. If you see that his hands are relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move them, extend them, or clench them, and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels nothing and experiences no pain, know that in most cases, he will not recover; he is doomed.
But if he can move them and feels the pinching and pricking, know that the marrow of the bone is intact, and the patient will recover with treatment.  If a fracture of the back occurs similarly, and you want to know if it will heal as well...
Look at his legs.  If you see that they are relaxed, and what happened to the hands has happened to them, and then, when he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily... If he lies on his back and tries to urinate, he cannot.  Know then that he is doomed, and do not bother with treatment. If none of this occurs, the situation is less severe.  The treatment for what has happened is to try to relieve the inflammation.
By placing rose oil on the injured vertebra, alone or mixed with roasted egg yolks, three times a day, until the inflammation subsides.  Then apply one of the strengthening, dry dressings to the area and bind it with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should only sleep on the side where he does not feel pain until he recovers. If a fragment or something else has separated from the bone following the injury, it is necessary to cut through the skin and remove that bone fragment. Then, if the wound is large, stitch together the edges of the wound.  Then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx (tailbone) is broken, insert the little finger of the left hand into the rectum.
Then, with the other hand, align the fractured bone as best as possible, and then apply a bandage and splint, if needed, and then secure it.
If you feel a fractured fragment within it, cut open the area and remove it, and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Fractures of the hip bones are rare.  If they do occur, the fracture is typically a splintering at the ends, a lengthwise splitting, and an inward tilting.  The affected person experiences pain, throbbing, and numbness in the leg on the fractured side.
To set it, run your hand over it to assess the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, align the ends as best as possible to resemble their normal shape.
If the fracture is lengthwise or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach to facilitate setting the fracture.  Once aligned, apply a dressing, then a splint of wood or leather, and secure it tightly.
Do not fear the fracture shifting or the splint loosening.  Fill the hollows of the waist with what will support the splint's alignment.  Instruct the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side, if a hot swelling develops.
Refrain from stretching or manipulating the fracture until the hot swelling subsides. Apply whatever eases the swelling, as previously described.  Then, return to setting and securing it properly.  If splinters or fragments are visible in the bone, do not remove them.
Do not touch [the splinters], but align them from the outside, as we said.  Maintain the securing until healed.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it in one of two ways.  One way is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, like this:
Tie straps to its ends, then hang it from a high position.  The patient sits in a chair, then lays their fractured arm on the stick until their armpit is pressed against the center of the stick's curve.  Then hang something heavy from above it.
Or a servant pulls it down. Then the physician straightens the fracture with his hands until the fracture is returned to its proper position.  The other way is for the patient to lie on their back and for their arm to be suspended from their neck by a strap.
Then order two servants to hold one the upper part of the fracture in their hands, and the other to hold the lower part and to pull each one in their respective direction. If you want the pull to be stronger, tie a strap below the fracture and one above it, and have each servant pull toward their own side.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the straps should be placed one under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the straps should be placed in that location and on the elbow itself.
Then the fracture is gently straightened without force until the fracture is properly aligned and joined together well.  Then, if no inflammation appears, tighten it.  However, if a hot swelling occurs, refrain from tightening it until the seventh day. Apply soft, moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil to it.
Until the swelling subsides, then tighten it. The method of tightening it is to place a bandage over the fracture, then wrap a new cloth layer over the bandage.  Then, pull the arm onto the upper arm, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
Hold the cloth and tightening on the upper arm and the forearm so that the arm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and there is no change in the broken bone.  If you fear a change in the bone, use splints.
Place a splint over the fracture itself, wider and stronger than other splints.  Maintain a finger's width between each splint.  The length of the splints should be according to the fracture, with an additional three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening described in the first section.
The tightening should be stronger at the site of the fracture.
The further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see the placement of splints and tightening as we mentioned in the context of setting the limb from your time, then do it.
If you fear inflammation, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said.  Then examine the ligaments every three days, so that there is no irritation or swelling, or that food is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening.  All this is corrected as we mentioned.
If you are certain that none of this will happen, do not loosen the bandage until many days later.  The patient should lie on their back, with their hand on their stomach.  A padded armrest filled with wool, properly positioned, should be placed under the armpit.
Examine the limb at all times, day or night, to ensure that the fractured limb's shape does not change or that the bandage does not loosen.  Correct everything with effort, and make the patient's diet as we previously mentioned, first of all gentle, until the bone is strengthened.
Then the diet should be made thicker.  It is customary for the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days.  At that time, the bandages should be loosened, and the patient should use a bath and be treated with ointments suitable for that, if the fracture is serious and extensive.
Do not loosen the bandage until fifty days or even two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On setting a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the ulna. One is small, situated next to the thumb; the other is large, placed beneath the small one at the bottom.  Sometimes only the larger ulna is fractured, or only the smaller one, or both may be broken.
If the upper small ulna is fractured, its setting is easy, and healing is quicker.  If the lower ulna is fractured, the fracture is worse and healing more difficult.  And the worst case is when both bones are broken simultaneously. If the upper small ulna is fractured...
When setting it, the physician should apply gentle, moderate traction to align the bone.  If the larger ulna is fractured, traction should be stronger. If both ulnae are fractured, the traction should be very strong.
The hand should be positioned, during setting and traction, extended on a cushion.  The thumb should be higher than all the other fingers; the little finger should be lower than the other fingers. The patient should be seated.
The cushion should be at a height so that the patient is not inconvenienced.
Then, an assistant supports the arm from below, either with their hand or a bandage, and another assistant supports it from above.  Then, the physician aligns the bone as best as possible.  If the fracture has splinters, they should be treated.
Return each splinter to its place. If a splinter protrudes, piercing the skin, and you cannot set it, make an incision and remove it as described previously.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate section is dedicated to this.
For the treatment of this, refer to the relevant section. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of the setting, apply a bandage made of linen soaked in rose oil and white wax, medium in thickness. Apply a gentle pressure to the bandage until the swelling subsides.
Remove the linen bandage and apply a dressing prepared from mill dust and egg white. Then, apply splints. The splint placed directly on the fracture should be wider and stronger.  Know that an arm usually requires six splints in most cases.
The fracture may be in one forearm bone or both.  Then, make the traction stronger at the site of the fracture.  As you apply traction up or down, gradually decrease the tension as described earlier in the beginning of the chapter.
The bandages wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not too stiff. The thread used for tightening should be linen, medium in thickness as described. Inspect the limb and ligaments after several days.
If any problem arises, such as irritation appearing on the limb, it is necessary to wash the limb with warm water until the irritation subsides.  Leave the limb un-bandaged overnight for rest, then resume the traction.
If the traction has become loose and the bone has shifted, or something similar has occurred, correct everything to the best of your ability. Also, if the limb is not receiving nourishment due to excessive traction, it is necessary to loosen the traction slightly and leave it for a few days to allow nourishment to reach it, and then tighten it again.
If the patient does not experience any of the problems mentioned, the bandage should not be removed for at least twenty days or so.  Then, suspend the patient's arm around their neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient should avoid sudden movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this arm fracture will heal in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two, or even in twenty-eight days, all depending on the individual's constitution and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On setting the fracture of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpal bones and finger joints rarely fracture, but often suffer contusions.  When the hand sustains a fracture or contusion...
The patient should sit with their legs crossed, and a chair placed before them, level with the ground.
Then, placing his hand outstretched on the chair, the bone setter extends the fractured bone and aligns it, the physician.  When proper alignment is achieved, a bandage and splint should be applied, if no hot swelling occurs.  A brace should then be placed over the injured area.
Wrap it in soft cloth; if the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, make a ball shape from cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with their injured hand, then tie it with a long cloth.
Let the splint be made of supple leather, so the skin can heal as the whole hand bends.  Tie it securely. If the fracture is outward, a splint should be placed above and another below the hand to keep the hand open and upright.
Then, the splint should be secured as the hand rotates, and the fingers should be tied together with bandages. If the fracture is in one of the fingers, if it's the thumb, align it properly, and then secure it with the hand.  Or, if you prefer, create a small, separate splint to keep the fracture straight.
If the fracture is in any other finger (like the middle, index, ring, or pinky), align it and tie it to the healthy adjacent finger, or tie all the fingers together, which is better, or use a small, separate splint.
As we said for the thumb, and examine after your treatment and removal from the hot swelling, deal with it as needed when such things occur, as described repeatedly.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On setting a fractured thigh.
The thighbone often breaks and is apparent to the touch because it shifts forward and backward.  Its setting involves tying a bandage above the fracture and another below the fracture, with the patient lying on their face.
Then, each attendant pulls the bandage toward its side, evenly, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  If it is near the hip, a soft bandage, of wool or similar material, should be applied.
At the hip, toward the pubis, the pull should be upward, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee, so the pull is downward.  Then, the physician aligns the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape.
The bone will knit together well.  At that point, the bandage and pressure should be maintained unless the limb develops a hot swelling.  If swelling occurs, leave it for several days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to treatment.
For the pressure, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture two or three times, leaving some extra.  Then, the leg should be wrapped so that the heel is at the hip joint.  A long thread should be inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread should be brought out from above on both sides.
Then, wrap the remaining bandage around the leg and thigh.  Then, place splints on the thigh, at the fracture site itself.  Make one splint on the shin bone.  Then, fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft cloths so that the pressure is even.
Then begin with strong pressure from the center on the fracture site, wrapping three or four times.  And as the bandage moves away from the fracture site, let your pressure become less, softer, and looser.
Then, take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie to the adjacent splints from above.  Then, run the ends of the thread down to the heel of the leg, and also tie the ends of the splints together on the other side.
So that the bandage does not move from its place, then leave the pressure on it as long as no sores, swelling, or puffiness appear on the limb. If any of this happens, immediately loosen it and correct anything that happened, as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a sharp fragment in the bone that pierces, then if possible, smooth it out. Otherwise, cut over it and remove it. Treat the wound in the same way that we mentioned earlier until it heals.  Sometimes the thigh fracture can be splinted without adding the leg.
As we mentioned for the humerus and forearm, except that such a treatment will not cause lameness to the patient.  However, if splinted alone, without including the leg, the patient will always become lame.
Know that the thigh is splinted for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less, all of that according to the variations in temperaments and other circumstances.
Chapter Fifteen.
In fractures of the patella.
The patella rarely fractures, but is often bruised. If fracture does occur, it is either a fissure or splintering of its parts, and this may be with or without a wound.
One must rely on observation for all of this, and reduce the fracture by aligning the separated parts with the fingers until they come together and fuse as far as possible through gentle and skillful realignment, then apply a bandage and a circular splint if needed.
Then apply a bandage over this, following the same approach as for other fractures; treat any swelling or other symptoms as described elsewhere, addressing each circumstance with the appropriate remedy until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of fractured leg.
The leg has two bones: one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the ulna.  Fractures of these bones are similar to those of the arm bones. Therefore, its treatment is like that of the arm, the procedure being the same.  If both bones are fractured, the leg will turn in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg will turn forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, especially from below, this is self-evident.
Therefore, use traction and alignment, and bind the dressings accordingly, just as in the case of an arm.  However, if the fracture of the leg is severe with numerous fragments, the traction should be milder and gentler in your efforts to set it.
In treating the leg, there is something extra compared to the arm.  After you have aligned the dressings and completed all your work, take two pieces of pine wood, used for leveling rooms and placed between the cracks of planks, or similar material such as palm leaves.
Choose one with a moderate thickness, not thin, and let its length extend from the knee down to the end of the leg.  Then wrap two layers of cloth around each one lengthwise, placing one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let the length extend from the knee to the foot, then tie the two pieces in three places, at the ends and in the middle.  With this restraint, the leg will prevent tilting to the sides and be properly held in place.  A groove of wood may also be used along the length of the leg.
Place it [the groove/restraint] to prevent movement.  This is especially important if the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  Examine the leg daily, carefully checking for swelling or other abnormalities. If anything of that sort happens, address it appropriately until healed.  The leg bone will set in thirty days, or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen.
Fractures of the leg and fingers.
The heel bone is not prone to fracture.  Leg bones may fracture, and fingers rarely fracture, but are more commonly bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs and you see the bones overlapping, have the patient stand on the ground, upright as if walking.  Then, place your foot on the protruding bones and press them down, straightening them.
Until they return to their proper positions.  Then, take the bandage and splint, place a small, flat board with two flattened ends beneath the sole of the foot.  Then, tightly bind the foot with bandages and any other necessary materials.
After three or four days, remove the splint.  You will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.  The procedure is as described.  If some fingers are fractured, realign and straighten them according to the instructions for realigning fingers of the hand.
Then, create a splint for the fractured finger, making it slightly wider than the finger itself.  Then, place the board, as described, beneath the foot, and bind it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Place a splint on each finger, sized appropriately and wrapped in soft cloth.  Bind the board to the bottom of the foot, positioning each end of the board outside the sole of the foot for proper support.
You should not forget to treat all fractures with the symptoms we have mentioned, and address each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit in a squatting position, then gently incline her towards her back, holding her from behind.  Then, the midwife should fill the vulva with cotton until it is full and forms a ball within.
Then, have the woman move and gently raise her hips.  The cotton will then emerge, forming a ball at the opening of the vulva, and the fractured bone will be realigned. Then, place a support under her back.  When she wishes to urinate, carefully remove the cotton so she can urinate.
Return it to the position in which you first inserted it, then return to the initial support.  Do this for seven days or so, and it will be set.  If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube of reed to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then, blow forcefully into the tube, inflating the bladder within the vulva.  The fracture will be realigned. Then, pack it with cotton and keep her in the manner described above until she heals.  As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this [method] is used for its repair.
And its [treatment] is the same as we described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure for these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, is not difficult for one with some experience and understanding of this book; indeed, the fracture itself often guides you.
Follow the correct procedure for its repair and tightening.  Understand this.  If a man's penis is fractured, take the windpipe of a goose, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it and bandage it. Leave it for three days or so until healed.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the reduction of bone fractures when accompanied by wounds.
If a fracture is accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large like the femur or humerus, or similar, one should promptly perform venesection if the conditions for venesection, as previously presented, allow.
If the wound is bleeding, then one should promptly cauterize it with powdered alum, if nothing else is available.  Then, begin reducing the fracture on that very day, and do not delay.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if a hot swelling does occur, postpone the reduction to the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides.  Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for it will expose the patient to poor symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, exposed, one should attempt to gently reposition and align it with one's hands and a slight extension. If one cannot reposition and align it with one's hands, reposition it with this instrument, which is made of iron, seven or eight fingers in length. And its width should match the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should prepare three or four of them, according to the treatment needed for each type of fracture.  Let them be round, with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when pressed during use.
It should be sharp-pointed, with a bend at the tip.  The top should be thick, and from the middle to the bottom, much thinner. This is its image/shape.
It is called a *perim* in Greek, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent tip should be placed on the protruding bone end and used to gently push it back until the bone is aligned, and then the ends of the fractured bone should be brought into alignment.
If the fractured end is thin and the instrument does not grip it properly, then the end of that bone should be cut so that the instrument can hold it. If you cannot successfully realign the bone as described, cut it using a similar cutting tool as mentioned before.
Or saw it with one of the saws, as best you can. Then remove any remaining roughness or thin scales from the bone. If, after realigning the bone, the patient experiences severe, painful discomfort, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can restore it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. Once the bone setting is complete, dip a cloth in a dark, astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not place any ointments or greasy substances on the wound.
To prevent putrefaction and decay. Then, use splints when finished setting the bone. Leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, to the size of the wound.
Beware, be very careful, not to tighten the wound with the fracture.  Often, ignorant physicians do this, causing death, gangrene, or chronic inflammation in their patients. Your tightening should be gentle and loose, unlike the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some of the adverse effects we have described, and the patient experiences distressing pain at the site, you should not apply splints. Instead, make bandages of strong cloth in the area of the splints, and secure them tightly.
If, after a day or two, you see pus forming in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the liquid. Then use the dressings and ointments which we customarily use for wounds, like the four-fold ointment, and similar ones. You should loosen the bandages.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that the pus drains downwards easily. If the wound takes many days to heal and the pus does not stop, know that there are small fragments of bone.
Then you should probe the wound.  Any fragments that are loose, remove them and take them out.  If any fragments are not loose, and are irritating the limb and causing pain, then cut and remove them in whatever way you can.
If the wound develops a cold, or eating away, or another type of corruption or putrefaction, then you should treat each such symptom with the corresponding treatment described in its section.
If a large, prominent bone like the femur or humerus, or similar large bones, is fractured, you should not attempt to pull it out or remove it. Often death results from that.  Leave it until it becomes rotten; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see an opportunity to do so, otherwise leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the suppuration that occurs after some fractures.
This suppuration often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially if it is near the joints.  It makes the appearance of the limb unsightly and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
If the suppuration is fresh, use astringent medicines such as dates, frankincense, myrrh, henna, acacia, and the like, taking some or all of them, mixing them with an astringent drink or egg white or vinegar.
Apply it to the suppuration with care, securing it tightly, and leave it on for many days without removing it, then remove it and repeat, until the suppuration disappears, God willing, or apply a tightly sealed sheet of lead to it.
Lead has the property of eliminating all pus in the members. If the suppuration has hardened and become firm, and necessity compels its removal, cut it from above, and remove the excess, or pare it with a rasp until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating a fracture, if the limb is afterwards thin, contrary to its original nature.
If a fractured bone is set and the limb afterwards remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One cause is either the excessive loosening and tying of the ligaments improperly, or the excessive tightening of the ligaments so that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or excessive poulticing, or excessive movements at inappropriate times, or a lack of blood in the body of the patient and its weakness.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that the blood increases in him; using baths, bringing joy and happiness to him, and similar things; then applying pitch to the limb to attract much nourishment to it, or continuing poulticing with lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On treating fractured bones if they are rejoined crookedly and prevented from acting as they should.
If, after the healing of a limb that has been set, a deformity, a prominence of the fractured bone, or a complication occurs, and the appearance of the limb becomes unsightly. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, one should not accept the claim of those who say to break the limb from the head, as many ignorant physicians and setters do in our country.
This action is highly reprehensible, leading to great risk, and worse, injury. However, if the crookedness and complication are recent, one should apply water in which relaxing herbs such as mallow leaves and root, and crown of thorns, and the like, have been boiled.
And apply relaxing bandages, such as well-made diachylon, or take the sap of the mallow root, mix it with chicken fat and butter, and bandage with it, or take ripe figs, grind them with pigeon dung and similar medicines called resolving remedies.
And the complication will resolve with gentle, continuous rubbing with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions all the time.  If the deformity is old, severe, and hardened, and necessity demands treatment with iron.
One should then cut through the top, release the bone connection, and cut off any remaining complication or excess bone with gentle and careful cuts, and then treat the wound as previously mentioned until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocation of a joint from its place, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the afflicted severe pain and suffering.  Therefore, when a person suffers a dislocated jaw, one should immediately attempt to return it to its place.
Do not delay it at all. If delayed, the area will swell and become a hard lump, making it difficult to reposition the jaw.  Therefore, it should not be delayed, moved, or stretched while swollen, as this often causes painful spasms and suffering to the patient.
However, if this occurs, one should first bleed the patient, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat.  Then, apply warm water and ointment to the affected area.  Then, gently reposition the jaw, and treat each affected area as described in its proper section.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged, as was done previously for fractures, from the upper part of the body downwards.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On treating the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely dislocate, and their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they slip slightly out of place, relaxing somewhat, or they dislocate completely, relaxing fully. The jaw will slip towards the chest, causing the patient to drool and unable to retain saliva, or to close his jaw, or to articulate his tongue in speech. If the dislocation is slight, it will usually return to its place easily.
However, if the dislocation is complete, the jaw must be quickly returned and delay is unacceptable.  The attendant should hold the patient's head while the physician inserts one finger into the socket of the jaw inside the patient's mouth if the dislocation is on one side.
Or if the dislocation is on both sides, the physician should insert both thumbs, and the other fingers on the outside to align it.  He should instruct the patient to relax and open his jaw in all directions and the physician should realign and reposition the jaw until it returns to its place.
If returning the jaw is difficult, especially if both are dislocated, use warm water and ointments to ease their return. Do not delay their return, as we have said.  Once they return to their normal alignment, and the patient's mouth closes without relaxing further, apply bandages soaked in a mixture of wax, fat, and rose.
Then gently tie it with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on his back, with his head propped up between two pillows, so that he does not move it to either side, nor attempt to chew anything.  His food should be soft and easy to swallow.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw sets, he may eat as he wishes.  He should use gentleness and avoid forcing his mouth open for eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw sets and heals.
If the jaws, when dislocated, do not return to their proper positions, considerable fever and persistent headaches often result, and the patient's stomach may become upset, possibly causing repeated vomiting.  If you observe this, know that the condition is severe.
Often, a patient exhibiting this condition dies within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the collarbone and shoulder joint.
The collarbone does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest.  It may, however, dislocate outward, and this is apparent to the touch.  To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then press firmly on the area with your hand; it will return to its place.  Then apply a bandage and splints, and secure them.  As for the end of the collarbone that is near the shoulder and connected to it, it rarely dislocates.  If it ever does dislocate, it should be returned and adjusted as described above, or in whatever way is possible for you.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and a tight wrap.  Instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  This same treatment will also reduce the shoulder joint if it dislocates.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On reducing the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder joint can dislocate in three ways: one is downwards towards the armpit, another towards the chest, and a third, rarely, upwards toward the shoulder itself.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder blade or in front of the nerve.  Most commonly, it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, particularly in those with less muscle tissue, as it easily comes out and easily goes back in.
However, those with abundant muscle tissue experience the opposite; it comes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty.  Sometimes, a person might experience a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell with a hot, painful swelling, and mistakenly believe that it has dislocated.  Therefore, it is necessary to examine it thoroughly to verify its condition.
Then, proceed with the treatment. If the dislocation is downwards toward the armpit, when comparing the dislocated shoulder to the healthy one, you will find an obvious difference. You will find the head of the dislocated shoulder to be deformed, and under the armpit, upon touching, the head of the dislocated shoulder feels like an egg.
The patient cannot raise their arm to their ear, nor perform any other movements with it.  Likewise, if it has dislocated towards the chest or upwards, this will be apparent upon examination.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have a servant raise the arm upward, then place your thumbs under the armpit and forcefully raise the joint upward to its proper position, while the servant raises and extends the arm upward.
Then lower it downwards, and it will return quickly.  If it does not return by the method described, and the dislocation has occurred many days prior, the patient should bathe in hot water and use poultices that relax and soften, such as cooked fennel root, fenugreek, and crown flower in water.
Then the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under their armpit.  The physician then places their heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand, extending it downwards.
And the physician pushes the ball with their foot, and it returns to its proper position. Or, if you prefer, you can reduce it in this way: have a man taller than the patient stand beside him, placing his shoulder under the patient's armpit and lifting the armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards toward their abdomen. If the patient is light, then another item should be attached to them to weigh them down, and the joint will return immediately.  The dislocation may also be reduced in another way.
Another method involves placing a long, round-headed wooden plank on the ground, similar to the pestle head of a mortar, neither thick nor thin.  A soft cloth is placed on the head of the plank, and the patient, standing lengthwise on the plank, has the plank placed under their armpit.
Then the patient extends their hand downwards on the other side and also extends their body forcefully on the other side. The joint will quickly return to its place. If the reduction is difficult by all the methods mentioned, then use this treatment: take a plank about two cubits long. Its width should be about four fingers and its thickness about two fingers. It should have a round head to easily enter the armpit in this manner:
A soft cloth is then tied to the round head so the plank does not injure the patient. The plank is then placed under the armpit, and the entire hand and arm are extended downwards on the plank. The plank is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbar, laid horizontally. The hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. The joint will enter its place immediately. If it enters in any way possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then, the prepared bandage made from mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the entire shoulder, spiraling upwards.  The ball is firmly tied beneath the armpit.  The bandage is tied around the upper part, and the hand is suspended by a bandage to the neck.
The hand should not be moved for seven days. The patient's diet should be kept light, to strengthen the limb and hasten recovery.  After seven, or five, days, the bandage is removed and the patient is encouraged to move the arm. If the arm remains strong and does not weaken, it has healed.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture or other causes, cauterization with three small cauterizing instruments should be applied, as described in the chapter on cauterization. If all of this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint does not remain stable,
If the bandage and its tying are repeated many times but the joint remains unstable, dislocating and weakening, and the patient cannot lift the arm, know that the nerve in the shoulder joint head has been severed, stretched, or weakened. In such a case, know that the joint will never stabilize.
For dislocations of the jaw, which occur near the chest and breast and towards the back, it is reduced by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.  All other binding and treatments should be used until the healing is complete.  If, after healing, there is tenderness in the area and slow movement,
The patient should frequently use baths to soften the tenderness and return it to its original condition.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of dislocations of the elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and also returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is evident to the eye and touch in whatever manner it has been dislocated.
If you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, the dislocation's outward appearance becomes clear to you due to the concave joint.  The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder touch it.  You should act quickly and relocate the dislocation before a hot swelling develops.
If a hot swelling develops, its relocation becomes difficult, and it may never heal, especially if the dislocation is backward.  This is the worst type of dislocation, the most painful, and often results in death.
If it is possible to relocate, the attendant should extend his/her arms fully outstretched, and the physician's hand should be positioned above and below the elbow.  The physician should push the joint back into place using both thumbs or the base of their hands.
If the dislocation is forward, the hand may be bent once so that the palm strikes the shoulder that is next to it. If the dislocation does not return, use very strong and forceful extension; two attendants should extend the arm.
Two attendants should also hold the patient to prevent movement during the extension.  Then, the arm is rotated in every direction after a folded cloth or wide bandage is wrapped around the hand. If the physician works on the joint with their hands, they should anoint the joint with ointment to facilitate its easy movement.
Then the joint is pushed forcefully until it returns.  After its return, a bandage containing a compress, desiccant, and egg white should be firmly applied, and the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is removed. If the joint is fixed in its place and the ligament is released, leave it. If you see the joint is not sufficiently strong, reapply the bandage and splint and leave it for several days until it is strong, then remove it. If a swelling occurs after the joint has returned and been treated, [do this].
If movement is difficult, use soaking in a bath, gentle massage, and prodding until it softens. Alternatively, place a thick, soft sheep's fleece on the joint, bind it, and leave it for a day and night.  Then remove it and have the patient enter the bath.  If he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then repeat the application of the fleece one, two, and three times with bath treatments until it softens. If you wish to apply moist, finely ground cow dung mixed with ghee, apply it repeatedly, for it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist frequently dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints, but it is important to quickly reduce the dislocation at the time of occurrence, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot swelling develops.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board. A servant should extend the patient's arm. The physician should place their hand on the protuberance of the joint and push it until it returns.  However, one must examine if the dislocation has gone to the back of the hand.
Let the patient place the palm of their hand on the board during extension and reduction.  If the dislocation is evident on the outside of the hand, then let the patient's back of the hand be on the board so the physician's hand is on the same protuberance of the joint. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, apply a dressing that will soothe the swelling.
Leave it be and do not attempt to reduce it again, for it cannot be tolerated, and you cannot reduce it after several days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked, causing no harm to the patient, unless the hand weakens and the patient cannot grasp anything.
In that case, you will know that the nerve is severed or compressed; there is no remedy except to apply cauterization.  Perhaps it will be helpful, perhaps not.  Once the wrist is reduced, apply the dressing we described, then bind it tightly and leave it for five days.
Then it is removed, and the hand is exercised.  If its movement is impaired, and some stiffness is apparent, soften it with heated water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  If a finger dislocates towards the palm's surface or its underside, extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to its place.  Then bind the fingertip and support it toward the direction to which it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it stands straight on that day. If it is nighttime, bind it in the same way.  Continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, binding it at night.  Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Likewise, if it dislocates towards the palm's underside, bind it towards that same direction and do the same as before until it heals.  Likewise, do this for dislocations in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating dislocation of the spine.
When a vertebra in the back or neck has completely dislocated, or many vertebrae have left their positions, there is no cure, for death quickly comes to the afflicted person.
A sign of this is that the afflicted person's stool comes out involuntarily; they cannot hold it.  Often, some of their limbs, either legs or arms, or one of them, become relaxed.  If only one vertebra is out of place, it often moves.
And its displacement can be in four directions.  That which moves backward is called a hump.  Its treatment is to observe; if the hump arose in childhood, there is no treatment and no cure at all.  But that which arose from a fall or blow, or similar,
The ancients have described various treatments with lengthy accounts, much of which yields little benefit.  I have condensed this into a small amount that suffices for much of what they have presented, clarifying the meaning and explaining it. I have also depicted the apparatus differently from how they described and explained it.
I say that a hump that occurs in the front of the chest has no remedy and no cure, and likewise for those that occur to the sides.  Only those that occur in the back are treated, specifically as I describe, by lying the afflicted person on their face.
On a level platform near a wall, a moist pad is spread beneath him so as not to harm his chest.  Then, a vertical plank, planted in a hole in the ground, is placed near his head at one end of the platform, and another plank near his feet at the other end of the platform.
One attendant holds one plank, which is not secured in the hole, and another attendant holds the other in the same manner.  Then, a soft, secure bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under their armpits.  A portion of the bandage is extended to the plank at the head and tied to it.
Then, another bandage is tightened over his hips, knees, and ankles.  Then, all the bandages are gathered and tied to the other plank near his feet.  Then, each attendant pulls the plank towards their side using the bandage, and the planks remain in their fixed positions.
However, they are not fastened, as we said. The physician places his hands firmly on the protrusion to cause it to return, or he places a board over it and leans on it with his legs until it returns.  If it does not return with this treatment, a board about three cubits long is taken.
A cavity is carved in the wall, near the patient, to receive the end of the board.  The middle of the board is placed on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end, pulling firmly to compress the protrusion.
And it returns to its place.  If you wish, you can construct it with a hand-spun coil, by driving two planks, each one cubit long, into the ground at the patient's head and at their feet, at the end of the store.
Let there be one span between each plank.  A hole is made in each plank, through which the coil passes.  All the planks are firmly secured in the ground so that they do not move.  A twisted stick (the coil) is inserted, and the bandage is wound around it in the holes of the two planks.
At its end is a hole securely fastened to a stick one span long, which is wound around it.  The same is done in the other two planks.  Then the bandage tied around the patient's chest is pulled on the coil at the head, and the bandages tied around the patient's legs are pulled on the coil at the feet.
Then a servant stands at each coil, twisting the coil with the twisting tool.  The physician straightens the hump as previously described.  This is the image of the coil, the store, and the patient.
Then, after the curvature returns and the area is even, the dried bandage should be covered with egg white, then with lint.  Then a splint of wood, whose width is about three fingers or so, and whose length corresponds to the extent of the hump, should be placed over the bandage.
And it should be placed over some healthy beads. Then it is tied with the necessary bandage, and the patient should use soft food until he is healed. If some protuberance remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then the medicines that relax and soften should be used, along with the splint that we described, for a long time.
A lead plate may also be used in this case.  A protuberance may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it may be mistaken for a dislocation.  This might be an extra bone that has protruded.  Do not use this treatment for it, as death might occur.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to the slight displacement and subluxation that occur in other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards.  It dislocates inwards most often, and rarely forwards or backwards.  A sign of dislocation inwards is that if you compare the healthy leg to the affected one, the healthy leg will appear longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will be unable to bend their leg at the groin.  The area next to the groin will be swollen and noticeably prominent, indicating that the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs of dislocation outwards will be the opposite of these signs.  A sign of dislocation forwards is that the patient can fully extend their leg, but cannot bend it without pain, and if they try to walk forward, they will not be able to do so.
Urine retention and swelling of the groin occur.  When walking, the patient steps on the heel.  A sign of dislocation backwards is that the patient cannot straighten their knee, nor bend it until after bending their groin, and the leg will also appear shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly visible near the hip area.  As for the reduction of these dislocations, one must observe if the dislocation has been present for a long time and the patient has not attempted its reduction, remaining in its current state; then there is no treatment at all.
Therefore, it should not be allowed to happen.  As for a recent dislocation, of any of the four types, immediately attempt to twist the joint, stretching it inwards and outwards, and moving it to the right and left; perhaps...
If it returns, it does not require any further treatment. If it does not return this way, then a strong, capable assistant should be positioned to extend the leg from below, either by hand or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another assistant should extend it from above.
By placing their hands under the armpits, then tightening a soft bandage at the root of the thigh. A third assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the extension is either performed from the front, from the groin towards the collarbone, or from behind, towards the back.
All of them should extend at once, until the patient is lifted off the ground and suspended.  This type of extension is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns as we have described, then there is no need for further treatment.  However, if not, each type requires its own specific treatment as I have mentioned.
As for the specific reduction if the dislocation is inwards, the patient should lie on their healthy side, then a bandage is placed around the root of the thigh, between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then, the bandage is extended upward from the groin, toward the upper part of the body and the collarbone.  A strong assistant grasps the thick part of the affected thigh with both arms and pulls it outward forcefully, and it will return to its place.
This method is easier than other methods for the reduction of this limb.  If this method proves ineffective, and the dislocation does not respond, then the patient's legs should be bound with a strong, soft bandage around the heels and knees.
Each bandage should be positioned four fingers' width apart. The affected leg should be extended further than the other, by two fingers' width.  Then the patient should be suspended from a beam in the house by their head, with their feet approximately two arms' length from the ground.
Then a strong boy should grasp the head of the thigh, and another boy should pull on the patient. The boy holding the thigh should push forcefully, and the joint will quickly return to its place.  As for the specific reduction if the dislocation is outwards...
The patient should lie on a mat, as described for a hunchback, and the bandage should be tightened around the affected leg and chest.  Then, two pieces of wood should be placed, one near the feet and one near the head.  Finally, a further piece of wood should be placed securely in the middle of the mat.
Damp cloths should be wrapped around the wood to prevent injury to the patient.  The wood should be positioned between the patient's thighs to prevent downward pull during stretching.  Each attendant should then pull in their direction, while the physician adjusts the hip with their hands. If the hip returns to its place...
Otherwise, place the board on him and press as we described for the hunchback, with the exception that the patient should lie on his healthy side.  If the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be stretched once while in this same position on the mat.
The physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand.  The pressure should be extended downward toward the knee.  If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be stretched downward.
He should be elevated off the ground, but placed on something firm.  Also, his hip should be externally rotated, as described for his position on the mat on his face with the bandages tight.
As we said previously, the board should also be used to press on the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint returns as it should, a sign of its return will be apparent to you: the patient's legs will be stretched.
If you see both legs are even and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its proper place.  Then, join the thighs, apply the dressing, and tie it with a bandage so tightly that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days.  Then loosen the bandage and dressing, and compare the legs. If you find them equal in size, know that the fracture has set.  Release the patient to walk; however, if you see any sign of weakness, do not permit walking.
Return and bandage it again, tightening it as you did before. Leave it for three more days, then loosen it.  The patient should walk slowly for several days until the limb is strong, God willing.
The Twenty-third Chapter.
On treating a fractured knee.
The knee fractures in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It does not fracture forward.  A sign of a fracture is to tell the patient to press their leg against their thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is fractured.  To set all types of fractures, have the patient sit with their legs extended, if they are strong enough.  A servant sits behind them, holding their waist and gently bending it backward. Then you sit on their thighs.
Press your back against his face, place his leg between your legs, then grasp his knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers on the knee.  Then, firmly press both sides of his knee with your hands.  Another attendant should extend the leg until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh, smoothly, not forcibly. Then bandage it, and secure the leg to the thigh.  Tie them together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  Only light walking should be done for several days, until strength returns.
If you cannot return it using the method described, then use strong traction with the bandages previously described for hip treatment until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may dislocate slightly, or completely.  Its dislocation may be inward or outward. A sign of dislocation is that the heel is swollen and prominent on the side to which it has dislocated.
For a slight dislocation, gentle traction with the hands is sufficient to restore it. However, if it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit and be held by a strong attendant behind his middle.
Then, with your right hand, grasp his foot from above, and with your left hand, grasp it from below, at the ankle. Pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left, twice. Then, extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand, without force.
Do this twice as described.  Then, on the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling on the ankle. If it returns in one or two attempts following this method, and you see the foot is straight, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it does not return using the methods described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly place a firmly tied peg or stake in the ground, positioned between his thighs and wrapped with a cloth to prevent injury. Then, an assistant should hold the patient's thigh.
Then another assistant stretches the leg, either with their hands or with a bandage tied around the leg.  Each assistant pulls in the opposite direction, while the peg remains between the patient's thighs, holding them to prevent the body from pulling down during the stretch. Then the physician straightens the joint with their hands.
Another assistant holds the healthy leg downwards.  If the joint returns quickly, then take the bandage and splint and tighten them with strong bandages. Tie the foot to the lower leg with a bandage.  Care must be taken to avoid the nerve located above the heel from behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes pain. Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it again, then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient must refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and become damaged, and treatment will no longer be effective.  If a hot swelling appears, the treatments described elsewhere in the text for soothing and poulticing should be used until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of a dislocated toe.
The dislocated part should be straightened with a gentle pull, without force, which is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toes on the top of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a level surface.
Or on a board, while he stands like a walker. Then, you should place your foot on the protruding joints and press down firmly with your foot until they return to their correct position and no protrusion is visible.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, encompassing the entire foot, with two ends. Tie it tightly for three days, then loosen it and keep them from walking for many days until it strengthens and a return is avoided, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation occurring with a wound, or a fracture, or both.
When such a thing happens and you attempt its treatment and reduction, it often leads to death.
Therefore, one should not undertake the treatment of such a condition unless he is skilled in the art, experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, and not rash or overconfident.  Initially, he should use only medications to relieve the hot swelling and then release the patient.
By God's will, except where you hope for recovery from injury with the mildness of the illness and some hope appears, then return it to its place at once, before the hot swelling occurs.
If the member returns to its place as desired, use the treatment that relieves hot swellings, and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments.  If the dislocation is with a fracture and splinters have separated from the bone, remove them. Follow in this regard what we have mentioned concerning simple diseases in their respective places.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the path of uncertainty, as I have previously instructed and advised you. This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your standing, God willing.
