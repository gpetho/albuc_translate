On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids
Chapter 36.
When there are old, multiple hemorrhoids in the anus, or even a single one, caused by thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and treatments have proven ineffective, cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back just below the waist in a triangular shape, and one cautery just two finger-widths below the navel.
If you suspect the patient's stomach is chilled and food is undigested, and you notice swelling in the face, then cauterize over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described, and also over the liver and spleen using a nail-like cautery. Leave the cautery site open for a while, then treat it until healed.
