When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so much so that it is greatly removed from its natural complexion by the superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back; and mark with ink three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this size on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the elbow comes; and there should be a space between each cautery the width of a finger; and the cauteries should be along the body, and do not press your hand too hard with the whole cautery; and only half the core should be burned, and let the patient be standing upright; and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms; and this is the form: 
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with the lancet, if you are skilled and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the entire core, because you would dry out the whole body; and do not let it come to a boil, for the core is very delicate there, and know this for certain.
