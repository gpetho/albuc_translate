The first chapter, in it are sentences and summaries on the matter of bone fractures, which must be presented.	CHAPTER ONE. In which is given the necessary compendious preliminary information on fractures.	0.62614405
When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that are very nourishing, thick, and firm, and contain stickiness, such as harees, rice, heads, trotters, cow tripe, eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and so on, for with this regimen the healing of the fracture will be faster and better.	When the broken bone has begun to mend, the patient should be nourished with very nourishing food, fat, strong, having some glutinous property, such as porridge, rice, heads, trotters, the tripe of cows, eggs, fresh fish, heavy wine, and the like; for on this diet the mending of the fracture will be quicker and better.	0.93299323
And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, can never connect and heal to their original nature, due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, and bones that are extremely soft, like the bones of young children, may connect and heal. However, nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something like thick glue that adheres to it and strengthens it until it sticks together and binds together until it becomes extremely strong and firm as it was before, so that nothing hinders its actions.	You should know that fractures occurring in mature and old people cannot join and mend into the original condition, on account of the dryness and hardness of their bones; though any bones that are extremely soft, like those of infants, may make a union and heal. Yet nature produces around the bone on all sides something like glue, with a certain viscosity, with whose help it joins, and it binds so that one part adheres to the other and they are linked to one another until it be good and firm as it had been before; so that there is no impediment to any of its functions.	0.8833736
For this reason, it is necessary to make the patient's diet consist of foods that contain firmness, stickiness, and thickness, as we have said.	It is on this account that the patient's food should be the sort that has solidity and glueyness and thickness, as we have said.	0.8875673
And know that the types of fractures may vary according to the difference in limbs, because a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the sternum is different from a fracture of the back, and so on for all the other limbs, each different from the other.	You should know that there are as many different types of fracture as there are members. Thus a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the cranium; and a fracture of the breast bone differs from a fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly there are differences among the other parts.	0.84511673
And we will mention each type of fracture explained in its chapter, detailed separately from others.	We shall give an exposition of each kind of fracture, each in its own chapter and distinguished from the others.	0.83049875
And the type of bone fracture may also vary in itself, because it may be a fragmented fracture without splinters, or it may be a fracture along the length of the bone with splinters and protrusions, either loose or not loose, and the fracture may be accompanied by a wound and a tear in the skin, or the fracture may be a minor crack.	The fracture of each bone also has its own variations; for the fracture may be a clean break without splintering; or the fracture may be along the bone, with splinters and projections which may be sharp or may not; and the fracture may involve a wound and a laceration of the skin; and the fracture may be a crack.	0.8680142
And each type has a specific technique for its treatment, as will be mentioned in detail in its place.	Each kind has its own special technique of setting which will be mentioned in detail, each in its place.	0.8439059
And know that if the bone is broken into two without splinters, but each part has moved away from its counterpart, you should immediately proceed to straighten and align it before hot swelling occurs.	If the bone is parted and broken in two and there is no fragmentation but a simple separation of one part from its fellow, then you should lose no time in straightening and aligning it before an abscess sets in.	0.6906023
If hot swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.	If an abscess does set in, then let a few days pass until it has subsided; then gently and skilfully straighten it in whatever way you can.	0.805446
And know that its treatment and alignment are easier than a bone that has splinters.	You should know that the setting or alignment of this is easier than that of a splintered bone.	0.7371986
Then tighten it as will be mentioned.	Then bandage as will be prescribed.	0.7815364
If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether it is a hand or a leg, either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.	But if the bone is splintered, extension from either side is necessary, whether it be hand or foot; with your own hands if it be a small member, or with two ropes or with one hand and a rope.	0.8895588
And let your placement of the limb be on a level surface, in its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken bone are extended, then quickly return those protrusions to their places in every way you can with skill and gentleness, and strive your best not to cause the patient any pain or suffering with your actions, and strive your best to join one bone to its counterpart in the best way.	You should place the part on a flat surface in its natural attitude so that when both parts of the broken bone have been extended you can try to restore the fragments to their proper place with all the skill and gentleness possible; and do your utmost to ensure that the patient experience no pain or distress as you operate. Try diligently to get one part of the bone fitted in the best form to the other.	0.87673855
And it is necessary at that time to touch and palpate them with your hand. If you see something wrong there, correct and align it as much as you can.	At the same time you should palpate and investigate both of them with your hand, and if you find anything wrong then mend it and straighten it to the best of your ability.	0.76836306
And beware of excessive extension and strong pressing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause hot swelling or chronic pain in the limb with their actions, as I have witnessed their actions many times.	But avoid violent extension or compression which many ignorant people apply; for by doing so they often cause abscess or crippling in the limb, as I myself have many times seen.	0.7554722
Then, after alignment, perfection, and tightening, keep that limb still and at rest, and warn the patient not to move it during his waking and sleeping hours, and when he turns and moves, and when he defecates, and in all his movements to the best of his ability, and let him ensure that the position of the limb is a position in which he is safe from pain.	Then after you have exactly repositioned it and bandaged it, keep that limb still and quiet, and bid the patient beware of moving it while awake or asleep, and in his shifting and stirring, and in opening the bowel, and in every activity, to the utmost of his capacity; and that he should try to let the position of the limb be such that he is free from pain; when pain or distress is felt in any position in which he has disposed the limb, he should move it to a different position in which he feels no pain.	0.88695335
This is because whenever he feels pain or suffering when positioning the limb, he should move it to another position in which he does not feel pain, and he should ensure that this position is level and straight so that no curvature occurs in the limb when it heals.	At the same time he should try to make that position even and straight, so that when the limb is mended there be no curvature in it.	0.6995726
As for how to tighten the broken limb, it is as I am describing to you.	As to the way to bandage a broken limb, it is as I shall now describe to you.	0.90589535
Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness, largeness, and structure. So what is small among them, such as the arm, finger, ulna, and so on, the cloth bandages should be soft and thin, and what is thick among them, such as the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be wide and firm, because the wide bandage adheres to the large limb and tightens it from every side evenly, without any gaps.	You should know that limbs which may be fractured vary in their size and shape. The strips of bandage for those that are small, such as an arm or finger or forearm or the like, should be soft and fine, while those that are thick, such as the hip, back, or breast, should have broad and strong bandages. For a broad bandage holds fast to a big limb, binding it all round with an even pressure so that no defect may occur.	0.8994949
Then wrap another bandage around it, then immediately apply the firm splints over these wraps if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.	Then wind over it another bandage and at once lay over it strong splints, if the part be not swollen and effused.	0.8147203
If there is swelling or hot inflammation in it, apply to it what soothes that swelling and removes the swelling, and leave it for a few days, then tighten the splints on it at that time. And let the splints be made of wide, carved, and wisely prepared reed halves, or let the splints be made of sieve wood, which is made from pine, palm leaf stalks, heather, or alkali, and so on, of what is available.	But if there be swelling or effusion in the part, apply something to allay the swelling and disperse the effusion; leave it on for several days and then bind on the splints. The splints should be made of broad halves of cane, cut and shaped with skill; or the splints may be made of the wood used for sieves, which are made of pine; or of palm branches; or of brier or giant fennel or the like, whatever wood be at hand.	0.85302204
And let the width of each splint be exactly like this image and this shape, except that the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints.	The size of each splint should be of this form and shape, except that the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and broader than the others.	0.86898977
As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is appropriate for the broken limb, in terms of its size.	As to the length of the splint, it should be greater or less as suits the fractured part.	0.77578366
Image of the splint:	Figure of a splint.	0.6734103
Then you tighten over the splints with another bandage, according to your first tightening exactly, then you tie from above with tight threads according to what we mentioned about the tightening, which is that your tightening on the site of the fracture be more, and the further away from the fracture, the less the tightening.	Then bind over the splints another bandage just as tightly as you did your first; then over that tie it up with cords arranged in the way we have said, that is, with the pressure greatest over the site of the fracture and lessened as you move away from it.	0.86454856
And the threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, like what I have seen from the actions of the ignorant who make their threads from twisted linen strips, which is a grave mistake, because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and the thin threads are also not suitable because you will not achieve the tightening you desire with them.	The cords should be of medium thickness, of linen supple of quality. For if the cords are too thick, such as I have seen ignorant people use who made their cords of twisted bands of linen, that will be a grave error, for moderate tension with these is impossible. Nor are fine threads suitable either, for with these you cannot achieve sufficient tension.	0.847407
And there should not be less than a finger's width between the splint and the splint, and if the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, then put under them soft lint or fluffed wool so that it does not harm him in any way.	Nor are fine threads suitable either, for with these you cannot achieve sufficient tension. Between splints there should be a space of not less than a finger's breadth. If, after bandaging, the patient is hurt in the sound parts by the ends of the splints, then put a little soft tow or carded wool under them until they no longer hurt him thus.	0.79491436
And if the fracture is with a wound and a tear in the skin has occurred, we will mention it separately.	As for the case of a fracture accompanied by an open wound, it will be mentioned in a special section on its own.	0.7123575
And know that not every fractured limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, because if the limb is large, the splints should not be placed on it except after five days or seven or more, depending on your safety from the occurrence of a hot swelling.	You should know that not every fracture should be bound up with splints on the first day; that is, when the part is big you should not apply splints until five or seven days after, or more, depending on when you are satisfied that there is no effusion.	0.8537759
And this is the description of the bandages with which the ancients used to set fractures, which are placed on the fracture, the jaw, and the sprain.	This is a description of the plasters that the Ancients used for repair, applied to a fracture, dislocation, or sprain.	0.70941645
Description of a brief, common bandage that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither predominantly hot nor cold.	Description of a common simple plaster for the repair of fractures, suited to most constitutions, particularly for women and children, because in it there predominates neither hot nor cold.	0.8751823
And it is that you take from the dust of the millstone, which is the heart of the flour that clings to the walls of the millstone during the movement of the mill, then you knead it as it is, without sifting it, with egg white, and you make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then you use it.	Take mill-dust, that is, the fine flour that sticks to the walls of a mill as the grindstone moves. Pound it as it is without sieving, with egg-white, to a medium consistency; then use.	0.6893734
Description of another bandage that sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains. Take ten dirhams each of mastich, labdanum, acacia, frankincense, bark of the acacia tree, and sugar, five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe, twenty dirhams of tamarisk, and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Greek clay; pound all together and mix with tamarisk water or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then use this bandage, for it is well-composed, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its moderation.	Description of another plaster for the repair of a fracture, luxation, or dislocation: take ten drachms each of pulse, gum-mastic, acacia, elecampane, mughath, and sukk; five drachms each of myrrh and aloes; twenty drachms of tamarisk and twenty drachms of clay of Armenia or Asia Minor; all should be pounded fine and mixed with water of tamarisk, or with eggwhite if the patient be of a warm constitution; then use this plaster, which is excellent for uniting, quickly repairing broken bones, and suits most people because of its mildness.	0.9278445
Description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains. Take ten dirhams each of acacia bark, mastich, and white marshmallow, five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe, six dirhams of acacia, twenty dirhams of Armenian clay; pound all together finely, sift, and knead with water or egg white, and use.	Description of another plaster valuable for a fracture or sprain: let there be taken ten drachms each of mughath, pulse, and white marsh mallows, five drachms each of myrrh and aloes, six drachms of acacia, and twenty drachms of Armenian clay. Let them all be well beaten up and passed through a sieve and made into a paste with water or egg-white and used.	0.91780466
Description of a bandage for joints and bones displaced from their places, and it soothes the pain that occurs to them, and for bone fissures and fractures. Take clarified wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area.	Description of a plaster for dislocated joints or bones, soothing the accompanying pain, and for a crack or fissure of bone: let unwashed wool be taken and soaked in a decoction of oil and vinegar and applied to the place.	0.82972175
This bandage does not have the strength to set bones, but it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pains in particular.	Now this plaster has no power of repair but it is outstanding for reducing effusion and dispersing pain.	0.7073392
Description of another bandage that sets broken bones. Take the leaves of the mute fig and the leaves of wild poppy, pound them together, and apply them moist.	Description of another plaster for the repair of a broken bone: let there be taken the leaves of the hard fig and of the wild poppy and both be beaten up together and a plaster made of them while still fresh and damp.	0.7428725
Description of another brief bandage used when the bone fracture is setting and you want to resolve the remaining swelling. Take one part each of marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and cress seed flour; pound all together and knead it with clay if the limb is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or with water and use it.	Description of another simple plaster used when a fracture is mending and you wish to disperse residual swellings: take one part each of marsh mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of vetch; pound it all and make a paste with decoction of wine, if the part be not inflamed. But if it be inflamed make it up with water of fresh coriander or plain water, and use.	0.897713
Description of another bandage, stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when the bone is setting. Take one part each of marshmallow root, flax seed, fenugreek, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; pound all together and knead with purslane water or fresh water or with clay, all depending on the heat of the limb and the calmness of its heat.	Description of another plaster stronger than the former for resolving, used if a hard swelling arises as the bone sets: let there be taken equal parts of each of marsh mallow roots, linseed, fenugreek, melilot, sweet marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; they should all be beaten up together and made into a paste with willow infusion or sweet water or wine, according to whether the part is inflamed or its heat has subsided.	0.88931733
As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything be placed on the fractured limb when setting it except the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else, and he described it as being medium between thick and thin.	Now Hippocrates in his book did not mention any application for the repair of a fractured part except a wax plaster made of wax and oil, nothing else. He prescribed that it be of a consistency midway between thick and thin.	0.8358078
As for Galen, he saw that things that have dryness with some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and similar to what we mentioned, should be placed on the fractured limb when setting it.	Galen, on the other hand, thought it good to apply to the broken limb, when it is mending, things which have a certain power of drying, with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, olibanum, and the sort of thing we have mentioned.	0.82860637
Description of a bandage that is useful for weakness and pain. Take equal parts of acacia bark, chickpeas, cut human hair or bird feathers, marshmallow, and salt; pound, sift, knead, and apply as a bandage.	Description of a plaster valuable for debility and pain: let equal parts of each be taken of mughath, chickpease, minced human hair or birds' feathers, marsh mallows and salt; grind it up and pass through a sieve and make into a paste and use as a plaster.	0.88272643
As for the amount of time the bandage should remain then be loosened, it is that you observe, and if the patient does not experience pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place, then do not loosen it for many days.  If severe itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area, then hasten to loosen it immediately and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it.	As to the length of time the bandages should remain on before being loosened: you should keep an eye on the patient and if he suffers no pain or itching or any shifting of the broken bone, then they should not be loosened for a number of days; but if he experiences at the place a violent itching or a disturbing pain or swelling, then hasten to loosen them and make no delay; and remove the plaster.	0.8909333
Then take a soft cloth or a moist sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour, then apply to it clarified wool dipped in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and tie it on for a night until you are safe from hot swelling, the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain goes away.  Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as your first tightening, and be gentle with it until it heals.	Then you must take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge and dip it in tepid water and bathe the place until the itching subsides and the pain settles; then let the limb rest for an hour; then apply to it raw wool soaked in oil and vinegar or oil of roses, and bandage it on for one night until you are sure there is no effusion and the swelling of the limb has subsided and the pain has gone. Then put the bandage on again gently, and a light plaster; do not bind it up as you did at the first but go gently with it until it heal.	0.95348555
If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, swelling, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need the bandage and tightening, then reapply it as you did initially, exactly.	If you see that the effusion, inflammation, pain, swelling, and other symptoms are totally gone, and you need to plaster and bandage it, then repeat just as you did at first.	0.9120413
If none of what we mentioned occurs in the limb, do not loosen it except after three days or four or five or seven, and it may be left for twenty days, all of that depending on what you observe of the condition of the limb, as we said, until the fracture sets and the flesh nearly coagulates on it, then increase the tightening more than your first tightening altogether, and also increase the thickening of the patient's food as mentioned previously.	But if none of these things that we have mentioned occur, then do not loosen it until after three, four, or five days or a week; sometimes it may be left up to twenty days, depending on how the limb appears to you, as we said, until the fracture be united and the flesh over it be near to joining. Then bandage more tightly than before, and increase the heaviness of the patient's food as has been mentioned.	0.89729583
If you see that the site of the fracture has dried and become emaciated more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it, so moisten it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let that be every three days, and slightly reduce the tightening, for by this action nourishment will flow to the limb and it will heal quickly.	If you see the place of the fracture getting more dry and thin than it should, you may know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it; so foment it with tepid water each time you loosen it; do this every three days, and ease the bandaging somewhat. This action makes nourishment flow to the limb and it will quickly heal.	0.9410885
As for what the ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the limb again if it did not set properly the first time and set crookedly, it is a mistake of their doing and a great deception. If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of that from any of them at all, and the correct thing is not to do it.	What some ignorant bone-setters do is to break the bone again if at first the repair is not as it should be and has mended crookedly. This operation of theirs is mistaken and dangerous; if it were right the Ancients would undoubtedly have spoken of it in their books and would have used it. But I have not found a trace of it in a single one of them; and the right course is not to use it.	0.83992183
