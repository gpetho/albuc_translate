Chapter thirty-three on joining loose molars with silver threads or with gold threads.
If the front molars become loose and move due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything edible lest they fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but the treatment has not been successful
then the trick is to tie them with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains in its state forever and is not affected by that.
The thread should be medium in thinness and thickness, as much as can fit between the molars.
And the method of tying is that you take the thread and insert its bend between the two healthy molars, then weave with the ends of the thread between the loose molars, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy molar on the other side, then you return the weaving to the side you started from.
And tighten your hand gently and wisely so that it does not move at all, and your tightening of the thread should be at the roots of the molars so that it does not escape.
Then cut the ends of the excess thread with scissors, gather them, twist them with the husk, and hide them between the healthy molar and the loose molar so that they do not hurt the tongue.
Then leave it tightened like this as long as it remains.
If it becomes loose or breaks, tighten it with another thread, and they will enjoy it like this for the rest of their life.
This is a picture of the molars and the method of tying in two healthy molars and two loose molars, as you see.
And one or two teeth may return after falling out, to their places, and become fixed, as we have described, and remain.
And only a skilled and delicate craftsman does that.
And he may carve bone from the bones of cattle, and make from it the shape of a tooth and place it in the location from which the tooth has gone, and fasten it as we have said, and it remains and benefits from that.
