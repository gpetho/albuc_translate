On the treatment of fractured bones if they are set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.	On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning.	0.9130331
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a protrusion of the fractured bone appears, or a knot, and the form of the limb is therefore ugly. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, you should not accept the opinion of someone who claims to break the limb from the top, as many ignorant doctors and bone-setters do in our country.	When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again. In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this.	0.8234299
This practice is very reprehensible and leads to great dangers, the least of which is permanent damage. However, if the crookedness and knot are soft, it should be poulticed with water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and root, melilot, and the like.	The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility. But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon.	0.77842224
It should be dressed with softening bandages, such as expertly made diachylon, or the mucilage of marshmallow root may be taken and mixed with chicken fat and fresh butter and applied as a dressing, or ripe figs may be pounded with pigeon dung and similar medications that are called resolvents.	Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied. Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.	0.67078245
The knot may also be resolved with constant gentle massage with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.  If the crookedness is old and severe, and hardened, and the necessity arises to treat it with iron.	Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.	0.7064707
It should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and the excess knot or bone should be cut with fine cutters, and gentleness should be used in this with great effort and care. Then the wound should be treated as mentioned previously until it heals.	But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care. Then treat the wound with the means previously described until it heals.	0.7996515
