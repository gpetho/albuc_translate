O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the medical sciences, and through its completion, its end has been reached, and through its explanations and clarifications, it seems to me that I have completed it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operative art with the hands, that is, surgery.
Because the operative art with the hands is almost entirely absent in our region and time, the science of it is greatly endangered, and its knowledge is obstructed; and there remain only some small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been misinterpreted and have fallen into error and hesitation, so that the understanding of it is clouded and its strength and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I will revitalize it [the operative art] through the organization of this treatise, in accordance with the method of explanation, clarification, and abbreviation; and so that it may come equipped with the forms of cautery instruments and other tools of the craft, including their explanation and preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled craftsman with his hands is not easily found in our time is because the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which includes knowledge of the arrangement of the limbs, their form, the connections and separations of those parts,  the knowledge of the bones, nerves, and ligaments, their number, and their arrangement; and the knowledge of the pulsating veins and the stationary ones, and the locations of their origins.
And therefore Hippocrates says that with a name alone, the subject is little, but especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said this in the introduction of this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy will inevitably fall into error, for which men will die, as I have seen many such, because some are trained in this science and yet operate without it [the scientific knowledge] and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled physician, having incised a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some of the arteries of the neck, so that much blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who claimed to have removed a stone from a man who had suffered long, the stone being large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, causing the man to die on the third day.
And I myself, having been called upon to remove that stone, saw that because of the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and went to a black-skinned man who had a fractured thigh.  The physician, with his ignorance, treated the fracture, placing the injury on top of cushions and bandages with excessive tightness, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he unbound him according to his desires, and then he bandaged him, and then he left him for a few days and commanded that we should loosen the bandage; and it remained like that until the thigh and foot became full of pus, and he perished.
And I was called to him, and I proceeded to loosen the bandage, and tranquillity was achieved, and he was freed from his pains.
However, corruption had already set in within the limb, so that I could not halt it, and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated over several days, until the severity of the condition was magnified with the patient's suffering.
Which cause is that because cancerous sores are pure of melancholic humor, therefore they should not be removed by complete cauterization, but rather the affected limb should be amputated.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical procedure be divided into two parts: one being the procedure associated with health, and the other the procedure that poses a risk in the majority of cases.
And I have already shown this throughout this book, where there is a procedure that is error-prone and fraught with fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this and abandon it, so that the mistakes do not find a way to speak and disgrace you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and God's protection, and your patients with kindness and firmness.
And use the best path, by God's grace, to achieve health and praiseworthy success, and abandon the terrible illnesses of difficult cure, and free your tools from that which makes you fear, so that your skill in your faith and in your name does not escape you: for more remains for your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his teachings: Do not treat a severe illness, lest you be called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter is ordered from head to feet, concerning the forms of instruments and the tools of cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of incisions and perforations, and of cupping, and of sores, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered by the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the treatment of twisting and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of instruments.
It is necessary for me to describe the benefits of this cauterization and its harmfulness, and in which constitution cauterization is prohibited.
Therefore, I say that the discussion of the benefits and harm of cauterization is long and lengthy, subtle in science, and secretly hidden; and already many wise men have spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and for me, a small part of their discussions suffices, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cauterization is beneficial to all constitutions universally, which are with matter or without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter, there is disagreement; for some have said that cauterization is beneficial to it, and others have said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in illnesses that are due to qualities and dryness, for the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry illness be cured with something that is hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite argue that cauterization is beneficial in all hot and dry illnesses that affect people's bodies, because when you compare the body and its moisture to the constitution of fire, you find the body to be cold.
And I say, regarding this argument, that experience has shown me this to be true on several occasions.
However, this should not be accepted by someone who has not already been trained and experienced in the chapter on cauterization through prior practice, and who has not understood the variety of human constitutions, the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the timeframes associated with them.
But in other constitutions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, for all doctors have agreed upon these, and there is no disagreement on the benefit of cauterization in them.
And understand, children, that the secret of healing through cauterization with fire, and its effectiveness, is superior to cauterization using medicinal burning substances because fire is simple.  Its action only affects the member being cauterized and does not harm other connected members except through minor damage.
However, the action of medicinal burning substances spreads to those members distant from it, and easily causes severe illnesses in the affected member, making healing difficult and prolonging suffering.
But fire, because of its purity and goodness of substance, does not do this; rather, it simply flows over.  We already know this through experiment and a long period of study of the art, understanding the truth of its causes.  Because of this, I am excused from a long discourse.  And if it were not for the fact that my book in this place, dedicated to the secrets of fire, and its effect on the body and the expulsion of illnesses, is already written (the operation of which it describes); a philosophical discourse demonstrating it, suitable for your comprehension, would be unnecessary.
And understand, children, that they disagree on the time when cauterization is most effective, and they consider springtime the best time.
And I say that cauterization is appropriate at any time, because the harm caused by time is overcome by the benefit gained from the cauterization, and especially if the cauterization is for acute and sudden pains or necessary ailments, which cannot tolerate delay, because the risk of greater harm from worsening is greater than the minor harm from the passing of time.
And this is not considered by you, or, children, this is not understood by the ignorant crowd or foolish physicians; they believe that every illness treated by cauterization is not always cured, and they thus conclude this.
And the reason is not as they imagine, for cauterization is a form of medicine that alters the complexion and dries up the moisture that causes the pain.
But nevertheless, cauterization is superior to other medicine because of its power, the efficacy of its action, and the grandeur of its effects.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient's constitution, the location of the illness, their strength, and the buildup of excess fluids within them, and what they have consumed in food and similar things.  However, if the illness for which cauterization is administered is a localized ailment with few excess fluids and moisture, like toothache and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this is in small instances.
And it is commonly said that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, and that is a true statement, not in the way they understand it, for they believe there is no cure that works with medicine or any other means after cauterization.
And the reason is the opposite of that; the idea that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is only true when we have tried other methods of treatment for certain illnesses, and those methods did not work, and then, at the end, one resorts to cauterization, which does help in that situation. Therefore, the statement that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is not true according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said this only because of the purity and superior nature of gold's substance.
And they said that the cauterized area does not heal, but this is not entirely true, for I have proven this and found that this only happens in certain bodies and not others. Cauterization with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you cauterize with gold-heated fire, it is not clearly explained to you, because the heat is specific to the amount you want due to the gold's resilience.  And because it is prepared to accept cold, if you apply the heat, the gold melts due to the fire, and some filings fall into the fire, causing the artisan trouble because of that.
Therefore, cauterization with iron is done more easily and more effectively for the correct execution of the procedure.
And I have organized this chapter on cauterization according to topics, and I have arranged those from the head down to the feet, so that the seeker may find what they want in it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is effective against dampness and coldness affecting the brain, the cause of which is often twofold: a chronic and profuse rheumatic flux, known as a cold, flowing from the head to the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep; it also causes toothaches and sore throats, and generally any ailment stemming from cold, such as paralysis, stroke, and similar conditions.
The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, order the patient to be purged with laxative medicine, clearing the head, for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and constitution.
And then order him to shave his head, and then place him on a padded bench with your hands on his feet.
And then place the blade of your palm near the root of his nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark the area with a mark, and then apply the olive cautery, which is done like this:
And then place that [cautery] on the marked spot, in such a way that it descends, with your hand being gradually tightened, and you turn it.
And then gently lift your hand and observe the area.  If you see any significant amount of bone exposed, about the size of a grain of barley, then lift your hand.  If not, then return your hand with that iron, or another, if it has cooled, until the bone is visible as I have described to you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area, and leave it there for three days.
Then apply a cloth soaked in broth and leave it on until the scar from the fire is destroyed. And then treat the area with four-drug ointment until it is healed.
And if the wound remains open, the better it is to keep the arm elevated, because this is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's substance has adhered.
And then remove what has adhered to the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery they should reach the back, until it firmly presses on the bone until the bone breaks, and this is the method of a small cauterization. And they believe that vapors from the head escape from that location.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
However, I have not seen these two types of cautery in all cases, but only in some individuals, according to a cautious approach.  And, in my view, it is better, when possible, to use a gentler treatment; for the head is weakened by a disruption of its continuity, just as we have observed in other parts of the body, especially when the patient's head is of a frail nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and by using it and with that technique, it's done with care.
Second Chapter.
Of cautery of the head.
When a chronic and prolonged pain affects the entire head of a patient who has been treated with cupping, leeches, head purges, plasters, washes, poultices, fowl and similar remedies, and especially if the previous cauterization with the method we've described has been ineffective, then consider that if the patient's head is of a strong constitution and not frail, and is experiencing intense cold, then cauterize with another cautery just below the first one slightly. And then cauterize that area on the temple of their head with a cautery until the skin is broken. Cut the skin open, and expose the bone to the extent described earlier, and cauterize that area on the back of the head in the area known as the "vas" (and it is the area where a cupping glass is placed). And ease your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience a great pain, different from the pain of other head cauterizations.
And I would recommend this cautery in its place, for the cautery used for cauterizing the temples and the back of the head should be a more delicate cautery than the one used for cauterizing the middle of the head; and this is the method for it.
Chapter Three.
Of the cauterization of non-chronic migraines.
When a sudden or widespread pain occurs in the head, or extends to the eye, the head should be cleansed with medicines, and the other cure, which I have described in the treatments of diseases, should be administered.  If this does not work, then cauterization is performed in two ways: either with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is done by taking a clove of garlic, peeling and cutting off the ends of both its heads. Then, using a sharp lancet, cut the painful area on the temple until you create a small, hidden cavity beneath the skin.
Then, apply a compress to the area to gently constrict it, and leave it for three hours.  Then remove it and discard the garlic, and allow the wound to heal for two or three days.  Finally, apply a cloth soaked in broth to the area until it heals properly.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron, according to this method:  (or,  using fire as a cauterizing agent, the procedure is as follows:)
and it is called a "nail-clavil," because the head of it is like a nail's shape, in which there is some curvature, and a small eminence in the middle of it.
And then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand—so that the flesh below isn't burned—and turn the small iron slowly and quickly.
And if the amount that is burned by the intensity of the cautery is as much as half of it, lift your hand so the underlying artery isn't burned, to prevent bleeding.
And then soak some cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; and then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the blade's edge, following the cautery method, and be careful not to cut an artery in this, a properly executed, but not antiquated method.
Fourth Chapter.
Of cauterization of chronic migraines.
When you treat a migraine with what we've discussed in the previous treatment, and what we've discussed in the classifications of illnesses, and the treatment doesn't work, and sometimes because the illness prevents the use of what we've described in the initial cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then you must heat the knife cautery until it is white-hot, then make a line of cauterization on the site of the pain, a length equal to half a finger or less; hold your hand still once and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to damage the continuity of the jaw, which is strained by chewing, and that the ligaments and nerves that control it, are not injured, and do not cause spasms.
And if it is about the protection and caution of the flow of blood from the severed artery, for in its severance there is danger, especially for one who doesn't understand what they're doing, is not skilled, and hasn't practiced; and leaves the procedure unfinished at the beginning.
And I will return with a reminder of the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery, according to its method, in its place within this book.
And if you see that this treatment doesn't help with this illness, and you see the patient's condition is tolerable, cauterize in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have discussed in the chapter on artery constriction with a cautery having two blades; this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of cauterization of earaches.
When in the ear there is pain due to cold and it is treated with laxative remedies and the other treatments mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is the one called "puncta," which has this form:
And then apply the heated point, moving it around the entire ear in a circular motion, or in a series of small circles, if the pain is localized in specific areas. Move the cautery from the base of the ear slowly, after you have marked the location with a probe.
And if the cautery touches several points in the ear, cauterize each one, and then treat the affected areas until they heal.
Chapter 6.
Of cauterization of tumours.
Tumours that are cured with cauterization are only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type caused by dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of tumour with leeches, purges, and other remedies, and your treatment is unsuccessful, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, a second a little below the temple, and a third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, for softening occurs only on the apparently healthy side.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery on the right side of the ear's extremity, a little higher than the temple, and another in the temple, whose length is equal to the length of the index finger, and hold the cautery until the size of half of the affected area is burned.
And this is the method of cauterization, and it is a type of surgical procedure, the method of which is described beforehand. However, it is more subtle than what you have seen; and it is necessary to cut away some excess fat.
And then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old and you have treated it with what we have said, and you do not see improvement in the patient and the illness does not have a fever, then cauterize the area with four cauteries: on all the temples of their head; and with a cautery on the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the throat. And the method of cauterization is done according to what has been previously stated.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is further behind; and it should be further treated with whatever you proceed with.
Chapter 8.
Of cauterization of forgetfulness performed by flame.
Large jars and pills that cleanse the brain should be given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the patient's entire head and place a plaster of the described kind, found in the treatise on plasters, upon the patient's crown.
And apply it several times, for this is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order that I have already described.
And therefore, if this treatment is effective, then do so; and if not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, extending downwards from the highest part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. Place the width of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cauterization with the previously described treatment.
But if you add more and the patient tolerates it, then make a cautery in the middle place; and if you want a greater application, then cauterize it over the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be oiled according to the previously given form.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
You should proceed with the cleansing of the head with herbs and what we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with cautery in the middle of the head, and with cauteries on all the horns of the head, and with cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if, in the illness of softening of the body, the patient is weak and the illness is severe, then cauterize that with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and subsequently with a cautery until the body is relaxed, very loose, and then remove your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Of the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the brain of the patient at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment that we have described in the division when the illness is great and tolerates the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate the medicines, then administer poultices and masticatories that treat the brain, beforehand for many days, with a good diet.
Then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of the head, and cauterize above each temple. And if the illness is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize it with the cauteries I have mentioned, having simultaneously paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-like, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then use a delicate cautery in this manner.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries that we have mentioned in the previous discussion of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess leaning towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give them to drink that which purifies their brain, according to what has been previously stated in the division.
And then shave the patient's head, and then apply a properly made cauterization to the scalp, placing it in the middle of the head.
And let the patient be seated firmly, and be held in place on all sides.
And then apply a liniment; and a sheep's wool poultice is more worthy. And warm that over a fire with a measured, moderate heat, which the said patient tolerates when applied. And then place that in the middle of the patient's head, on the scalp, and leave it until it has cooled down.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with the other treatment for him, until he is healed; or, if you wish, cauterize that area with small punctures, following the patient's tolerance, but keep your hand with a cautery instrument appropriately prepared: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that cloth soaked in wool or hen's dung.
Chapter 12.
Of the cauterization of descending water in the eye.
When you are informed of the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I have mentioned in the section, then begin and give the patient to drink what will modify the fluids in their head, and protect them from all moisture.
And make that person sweat in a bath for several days.
Then command the patient to shave their head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on both temples if it is the beginning of watery discharge in both eyes, or on one temple if the watery discharge is beginning in one eye.
Cut with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are below the forehead; and let the cauteries be at that length, in the width of the temples.
And be careful of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flowing from them, stop it with any medicine possible to you.
And I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the prevention of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck below two bones with two cauteries placed directly.
Chapter 13.
Of cauterization of old sores.
When sores on the eyes are old, persistent, and evident through the veins and arteries in the exposed area of the head, and it is confirmed that this is due to cold phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize it with the cautery we described in the chapter on beginning with hot water on the sores, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on the neck below the temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the bones. And if more is needed, then cauterize that along the entire area of the eye socket over the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Of cauterization of nasal foul odor.
When you treat it with what we have described in the division and your treatment doesn't work, then you prepare and give the patient cocculus to drink for three nights; and afterward, shave the patient's head, and cauterize with a moderate cautery and an olive cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove cautery, using two cauteries just above the two eyebrows, slightly below the hair.
And be careful of the sparks, so you don't set it on fire.
And this is the form of the clove cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cauteries for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its method:
And if you, cauterize a small area above the two eyebrows with two cauteries, on all parts, and they should be positioned away from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the amount of eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too hard with the cautery, but only to the extent that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
Chapter 16.
Of cautery of the eyelid when the hairs are turned inwards and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cautery in such cases is done in two ways, either with cautery or with a burning medicine.
If with cautery using fire, command the patient beforehand to remove their eyelashes as one would clean them, until they are lengthened and thinned; and if they prick the eye near their origin, then you should bind the eyes with a bandage so that they are not injured until the hairs have grown back.
Then, once they have grown back and thinned, place the patient's head on your lap, and then gently press against the eyelid with a probe, with a marking shaped like a myrtle leaf, and begin the marking near the hairs.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or in a ptilli mucilage on the eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this shape.
And then cauterize over the shape you have marked, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
A sign of success in your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs raised towards the puncture in the eye.
And then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a border over it until the scab is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if, due to some cause, the hair begins to grow again and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are *under* the eyelid, then cauterize them until they are raised to their natural position and the wound is healed, so that the hairs don't irritate the eye.
However, a cautery with a burning medicine, which is what you command the patient to do, is to allow the hairs to grow out and heal, and then a leaf-shaped piece of cloth (like a myrtle leaf) is made.
And then take known herbs and living vinegar, or whatever that is, and mix those things well.  Do this quickly so it doesn't get cold; then spread this mixture onto the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf. Place this on the affected eye(s). Put a cotton ball soaked in egg white under the eye. And the patient's head should be supported by you.
And place your fingertip on the medicine and press gently, but don't remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for it burns like fire.
And when it persists in causing a burning sensation, then remove the medicine and gently rub it off with your fingertip; when the burning stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then check if the eyelid has been raised (like it has been released from the constriction by fire or incision). If so, it is well. If not, reapply the medicine to the place where it has not yet been applied and do not give up until your treatment is completed and the eye is healed.
And then apply a cotton ball with a bandage until the burn is healed, and then treat it with a definitive ointment or something else until it is healthy.
It is necessary for you, in the course of your treatment, to carefully ensure that no medicine gets into the eye.  If, after a few days, the eyelid becomes softened and some of the hairs get into the eye, then reapply your medicine to the softened area of the eyelid, just as you did at the beginning, and continue treating it until it is healed.
And this is the method of using myrtle leaf.
And understand that human eyes vary in size and thus your treatment is adjusted accordingly.
And the path to recovery for those studying this art should not be hidden.
Chapter 17.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula using the methods described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment doesn't work, then you should cauterize it as follows:  Instruct the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have an assistant hold the patient's head between your hands in such a way that it is neither moved nor shaken by their head's movements.
And then place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or plant mucilage over the patient's eye.
And then heat the cautery, which is shaped as follows:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's wing, at the end where the cautery is made.
And if you wish, it should be pointed towards the other end. And if you want, it should be shaped like a probe.
However, the one that is concave is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry that area. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which is well-heated, over it, and hold it with your hand a little distance from the cautery's edge, near the nose, so that your hand does not stray or the patient is not disturbed. Then place the cautery on the sore area and cauterize it.
And so, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place a poultice with lint over it and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply an aggressive corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier physicians said:  Open the area of the fistula and make it open, then place in that fissure a thin lead rod, which is its shape: and put in that quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold it with your hand firmly, so that the patient is not moved, lest the molten lead reach the eye; and it is necessary that you place on the patient's eye a poultice soaked in egg white or water, because lead adheres to the fistula area and heals it with remarkable healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a trepanation of the nose and to return the fistula to the nasal cavity to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of cauterization of the fissure of the pot (or, more literally, "pit").
Many times fissures occur in the lips, and more often in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment is not effective, then heat the small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is described:
And its concavity should be according to the thinness of the blade.
Then carefully apply that heated cautery to those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
On the cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When an abscess forms at the base of the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and it bursts, and is old, and pus drains and a fistula is formed, and you treat it but it does not respond to treatment, then you should apply a heated cautery according to the size of the opening in the fistula, and then insert the heated cautery into the fistula opening, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and this is done once or twice; and then treat it with the cure we previously mentioned until it is healed.
And therefore, if the discharge is cut off and healed, that is good; but if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone according to what is described in its relevant chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of the cauterization of teeth and the softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with remedies but it does not improve, then place the patient's head on your lap, and now apply a cautery tool whose shape is appropriate here, in such a way that you place the cautery instrument on the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold your hand there a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as you wish.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the decayed tooth is fixed, the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter 21.
On cauterization for tooth pain.
When tooth pain is caused by coldness, or there is a cold or worm in it, or you do not find a cure with medicine, then cauterize it in two ways: either with cow dung, or with fire.
Cauterization with cow dung involves taking cow dung, boiling it in an iron pot, then taking cotton and wrapping it around the end of a probe.  Then, dip the cotton into the boiled dung and quickly place it on the painful tooth until it cools down.
And repeat this several times until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in the aforementioned dung, place it over the aching tooth, and then place a heated iron on top of that until the iron reaches the cavity of the tooth.
However, cauterization with fire involves using a bronze or iron probe, and making sure it is thick enough so that the heat doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired form, place it on the tooth, and hold it there until it cools; repeat this several times, as the pain may disappear either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, by pressure of that cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize whatever extremity you are able to.
And this is the method of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Of the cauterization of extrophulos.
When extrophulos are of phlegm and cold humors, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, and you desire the digestion of them easily, then you ignite the cautery with the form of which is this following: having two open ends, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at the other end, and place that ignited one on the abscess once, and another if needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days, and place on it cotton soaked in water until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointment, bandages, and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Of cauterization for hoarseness of voice and constriction of the throat.
When humidity affects the airway, especially when this is due to a cold temperament, then the patient should initially be evacuated with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the area near the base of the throat in the affected spot.
And be careful not to cauterize too close to the throat or burn the skin excessively, but only a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the junction of the neck at the back of the spine. And the cautery should be a sharp, pointed instrument, in the manner previously described.
And then treat it with what was previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Of cauterization for lung disease and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are due to cold humidity, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is longstanding, then cauterize the area with two cauteries on the collarbone in the indented, deep, and hollow areas; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cauteries be sharp, following the previous form.
And if you wish, make your cauterization punctate with the cautery called a "puncta," the form of which is described previously in the section on treating ear pain.
And make punctures around those areas; and then treat it with the same methods described previously until it is healed.
And the cautery should have three prongs, for cauterization is done with it: in one application, you can make three cauteries in this way:
Chapter 25.
Concerning the cauterization of the "titillic" (which is the head of the help/aid).
When the head of the "ajutori" (a medical instrument or part of the body, unclear from context) is dislocated due to slippery moisture and does not stay in place during its return from the dislocation until it is properly back in position, and then through a slight movement it becomes dislodged again as it should be, as we have witnessed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and afterward have the patient turned onto their back or side; and then lift the tendon that is in the inner part of the "citillic" towards the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.
And then heat the cautery, having two heads; and this is its form:
Then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates through to the other side; and the figure of cauterization will then be of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore the cauteries are eight.
And then place a layer of cooked salt over the cautery, and then make the patient rest comfortably, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done, then cauterize the muscle with a pointed cautery, or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened, the moisture is removed, and the patient is cured.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, disrupting its composition and multiplying within it, and if you continue the methods of treatment and do not succeed, then the patient should lie on their back, extending their arms and legs.  Then cauterize the area with three cauteries: one cautery under the feet for a distance of a fingertip, using a pointed cautery; and two cauteries under the sides of the body,  until a triangular cautery figure is formed.  And separate those parts that are not joined, so that they create resistance.
And if the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the cord.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this shape without additions.  And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape; and this should be a cautery in the shape of a circle according to this shape:
And let the stomach be cauterized by pricking it where the cautery has created a fear or alarm,  and that you prick the stomach in the amount you desire with a probe, and then cauterize that with cauteries in those pricks;  and then cure it with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain in the liver is caused by coldness, or humidity, or great windiness, until its normal condition is expelled through excess, and the patient is treated as described and not differently, then the patient must be lying on their back, and make three cauteries according to this shape and this same size onto the liver under the ribs, where a person's body lies down.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be the length of the body's straight side.
And do not press with the cautery too much.
And if the amount of what is cauterized is the size of half a finger's breadth, and no more should be added; and if the patient is standing on their feet, and if not standing, then lying down, with their legs spread, and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and cauterize only the size of a fingertip, so that the entire body is cauterized and reaches the intestines, for the fingertip is thin here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the puncture of a liver abscess with cautery.
When an inflammation or abscess is present in the liver, and you want to know if that abscess is in the liver's flesh or its covering, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will experience significant weight and sharp pain.
And if it is in the covering of the liver, the pain is sharp and intense, and often the doctors are already exhausted in treating it.
Therefore, the patient should be laid on their side; then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rod, the form of which is shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the fibrous tissue, until it becomes healthy.
And then treat that as a cure for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate to use this type of cautery unless it is one whose use in the art of medicine is well-established, and by which many illnesses have been known.  However, sometimes, with some experience, it is risky to use this method on this operation. It is better to leave it to us.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterization of the roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy, done in this manner, is effective.  This means that you should take a long, dried root of aristolochia, a pointed long root that is found, and which is the thickness of a finger.
Then, immerse it in oil and heat it over a fire.  Then, cauterize with a cautery in the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck; and with two smaller cauteries guiding under, slightly descending towards the area below the beard.  And with two cauteries on the area descending between the 5th rib and the 6th, angled slightly towards the back. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest/stomach and with another on the stomach, and with three cauteries in the back; and with one cautery in the area between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, beneath the cautery located between the shoulders.
And it is not appropriate to hold the cautery in your hand, instead it should be held in the manner of a cautery used in practice.
And some ancient doctors said that some men use a cautery made of iron, resembling a ray, and heat it, placing it on the area between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and the pus is discharged, as we have described in the case of a liver abscess.
But this cauterization is not without risk, for one might accidentally cause a fistula in the affected area, which would be incurable.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease using the methods previously described in the division, and your treatment doesn't work, then cauterization should be performed in three ways, all of which are proper. One method is to make three or four cauterization lines along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the cauteries for the liver, as previously illustrated.
And there should be a space of about one finger's width between each cautery mark, and the method of cauterization should be the same as that used for the liver.
And do not burn your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be properly positioned on their back.
And there is another method of cauterization, which is to apply the cautery with two applications, as described in the chapter on muscle dislocation.  Lift the ribs which are on the spleen's side,  towards the patient's left side.
And your lifting should be along the length of the body, so that the cauteries are made across the width of the body.
And then, quickly apply the two cauteries, burning intensely, to the point where they penetrate the ribs on the other side.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three applications.
And then you treat the cautery, since it has stopped emitting smoke after many days, for this is more important than the other previous actions in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of dropsy.
Cautery does not apply to dropsy, but to something else specifically.
When you treat dropsy with the methods of treatment we have described in the division and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary that you cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, with one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one cautery on the right side of the foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportional to the severity of the condition.
And then leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not evacuate the illness from the wound after the cautery with what is necessary, for this will add two intentions to it, and hasten its healing with an additional aid.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be a wedge-shaped, following the shape of the previous one.  The cautery used to cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, following the shape of the preceding one.
Chapter 32.
Of cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the space between the malleolus and the anular region.  Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it. Then, raise your hand, and don't completely lower it again, because the yellow water is stubborn.
The cautery should be shaped like this:  Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh, use the knife-like tip of the cautery. And the cauterization should follow the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with the methods we have described.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is affected by cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and retentive powers, located in the stomach and intestines, this is treated with the methods of treatment mentioned, and if the patient tolerates cauterization, then cauterize the area with a large cautery on their stomach, following the method for cauterizing the stomach previously described, using a circular cautery and four smaller cauteries in a circle around the navel, a small, pointed cautery, and a cautery on the flank, or two cauteries.
And if the excessive moisture and the patient tolerate it, then cauterize the area around the groin and intestines, placing two cauteries on the stomach and close to the groin, for this is a perfect cure for the ailment, from which there is no error.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When there are old hemorrhoids caused by thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and they are not cured by the methods mentioned earlier, then cauterize with three cauteries on the pus below the spine of the lower back, a small, triangular cautery, and a cautery above the navel on both sides.
And if you fear that their stomach is cold, that their food is not digested, and their face often appears inflamed, then cauterize the area on their stomach with a large cautery as described before; and with one cautery on the liver, and another cautery on their spleen with a pointed cautery. Leave the cautery open for a period of time, and then treat them until they are healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of the armpit near the removal of them (or, more literally, near the excision of the armpit).
When you excise the armpit, then you heat the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Place that heated cautery into the excised armpit, and carefully guide your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice; for if there are many, then cauterize each one of them according to what we have recounted, and then treat them with the ointments you apply to them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over a large area, it is more harmful than helpful.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the affected areas.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described in its place, and the patient is distressed by this, it should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula naturally in the back, and it is old, and has pus, corrupted matter, and therefore, the most appropriate thing to do is to probe it with a fine probe, and then ascertain the depth of the fistula with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray. Then apply that heated cautery to this fistula, and according to the depth to which the probe entered.
And repeat the application of the cautery until those corrupted tissues are burned once, twice, or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then be careful of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not penetrating.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the materials are removed from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely cured.
And if the materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in a pre-existing corrupted area, or that this comes from the causes which will bring remembrance to their place.
Chapter 37.
Concerning cauterization of the kidneys.
When the kidneys have pain due to cold or excessive windiness, and this causes the patient's condition to deteriorate, then it is necessary to cauterize that area around the kidneys with a pointed cautery on each kidney, using a cautery iron for which the procedure is to be remembered.
And gently cauterize a small area below the first one, so that there will be three aligned cauterizations, and thus more beneficial afterwards.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that area of the bladder, just below where the hair of the pubic region begins, and cauterize with one cautery iron on the right side, and another on the left side.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the area; and cauterize that area with one cautery on the lowest part of the groin, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a pointed one, according to the procedure.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the womb.
When cold and dampness enter the womb, and therefore pregnancy is forbidden, and her menses are corrupted, and their discharge is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with one cautery on the area below the groin, or with two cauteries, and the cautery should be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of a dislocated ankle.
When mucous moisture has flowed to the ankle joint, causing it to leave its proper position, and a sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when they are compared. And the place of the dislocation is found where it is swollen.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle joint with a round cautery, after you have marked the area with a probe around the affected part as it is twisted, so that the part is in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form used previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cauterization be done according to the extent of the inflammation throughout the area; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes to the area of the back, and it is caused by cold and moisture, if the illness is cured by what we have said and not otherwise, and this is old-fashioned, then it is necessary that you rid the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial pills, or similar ones; and then cauterize the area.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods. One is to cauterize the area of the patient's back with three triangular cauteries, in this shape; and make a good depth with them. And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger, whether the cautery is small or large.
But sometimes the cauterization is on the middle spot on the top of the back, resulting in four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, the shape of which precedes the cauterization of a dislocation of the back, making it a continuous circle to burn the inflammation of the whole back.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the back and does not extend to the thigh.
However, if the pain extends to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh over the area where you perceive the patient's pain; and with one cautery on the shin, about four fingers to the outside.
And if the cautery is a knife, then the depth of the cauterization should be in proportion to the extent of the inflammation in the back.
And if the patient perceives that the pain extends to the area near the toes, then cauterize in that location with the cautery by applying three or four points, or more if necessary.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize that area with a knife cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not burn any nerves or major arteries, and that this does not cause unnecessary harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen others who have cauterized near the ankle, and after the cauterization, the leg became so swollen that the tumor spread to the foot, and the foot became perforated and corrupted. And afterwards, severe abdominal problems occurred, and this led to death.
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each one in this manner.
And some learned men advised, in cauterizing with a specific cautery, that it should be shaped like a circular iron disk, with a circumference of half a palm; and its opening should be the size of a date seed, or slightly smaller.
And within that circle, there should be another third circle; and the space between them should be the size of a hazelnut; and those circles should be open in two parts; and the length of those cuts should be one or two hazelnuts.  Make these iron markings neatly arranged within the circles; and this is its form:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the illness, the patient lying on their side. And therefore, cauterize that area with three round cauteries in one go.
And then leave it for three days; then plaster it with a poultice and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says:  "Oh, children, of this type of cautery we have used little due to the fear of its effects, and because few have been found to withstand it.
However, for those who endure it, these strong cauteries and their effects find their place within the afflicted.
But cauterization with adhering medicines is what you should do: make two circles, using a perforated iron tool, from which the iron door's hinge is released;  the length of the wall should be equal to their height, be they two nuts or other similar objects.
And if the spaces between each are the width of a finger; and are open below and above, and are to contain each other in this way:
And then place the sick person on their right side, and put your hand over the area of the groin; and then take warm water and place it between the two circles, and gently warm it with a small fire, and keep it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and scorching from it – for that brings on burning as if from fire – until the burning stops.
Then, raise your hand with the instrument and cleanse all the groin area with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and apply a poultice until the blackening from the burning subsides, and leave it for several days, and the hardness will disappear; this is the final treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, apply a poultice there containing water, just as was done for the groin.
And this is the method of applying hot water, and I have already written about it in my treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take an equal part of alkali and an un-extinguished ash,  grind them, and place them in a new, shallow bowl, the bottom of which has a small hole, sized to fit the patient's wound.
And place another, glazed, bowl underneath the bottom of the first bowl. Pour fresh, sweet water over the alkali and ash in the first bowl, using a finger's worth at a time, until they are thoroughly moistened. Then, use your hand to compress the mixture and let the remaining water, now possibly more acidic, drip down from the first bowl into the glazed bowl below.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over fresh ash and alkali.  For this mixture will now be very strong, a useful acid that is used in many medical procedures and cauterizations of other body parts, acting like fire.
And some of the medicines with which it is cauterized are thus:  turpentine, honey, crushed ash, and herbs with a sharp taste, mixed together.
And Galen recounted the treatment and cure, from an ancient physician, for the pain of angina and sciatica, and greatly praised its effectiveness, saying it needed no further treatment and that the patient was healed in a single application, as the text describes.  It was said that the remedy, when applied in a bath or medicated poultice, quickly worked.
And it is to be taken from fresh green rue, and if rue is not available, take fresh fig leaves.  Grind them with a little of powdered cumin and place them on the afflicted area, be it the angina, the thigh or the leg, and bandage it.
And let it remain for three hours, or for the amount of time the patient experiences relief from the burning.
And then put the patient in a bath, and once their body is flushed, let them lie on the ground, because the pain will cease and they will be healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the body has been purged.
However, Esculapius says that when a vein in the leg is cauterized with a goat's horn, it is very helpful; and the cautery should be applied in this way: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it between the affected area of the foot and the bone.
Then take a dry goat's horn, and heat it over a fire until it is charred; then place it on the wool and leave it until it has spread out (or cooled). And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the feeling of the bite (or pain) reaches the heart and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of the veins (or "cautery of the kine").
Chapter 42.
Of the cauterization of two-fold pain.
Sometimes pain in the back arises from various causes, such as blows or impacts, or excessive discharge, and similar causes, through the infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only effective in this specific type of pain caused by the outflow of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with medicated pills and similar remedies, placing them on the back where the pain is, in three lines according to its width, placing 5 or more cauteries on each line, according to the patient's tolerance and the efficacy of the treatment.
And let the cauterization be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a medial wedge-shaped cautery according to this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a swelling.
Often this ailment afflicts young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it affects their limbs and causes difficulty with raising and moving them.
And you find that the last vertebra of the back and the ribs begin to project over the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery that is circular in shape. that takes the cautery over the entire area of the vertebra completely.
And if you wish, cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery, two or three lines deep. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have described.
However, be careful not to apply cautery to a swelling caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter XLIV.
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that have infiltrated each part of the body, and when pain arises in the feet, it is customarily called gout by physicians.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold humors is treated with other methods of care and the pain does not subside, then use cautery to relieve it.
And you should cauterize the area around the affected joint of the foot with several cauteries.
And let the cautery be an olive-shaped one, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize the affected area above each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize the area, but do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand; it should only be around the size of a fingertip.
And if the pain reaches the knee and thigh, then apply the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and is called "suagra", then make punctures in the outline of the veins, as if circling them, making punctures along those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the outline of the veins above each finger and above the hand's knuckle.
And if the pain spreads to the knees or muscles over a few days, then cauterize each of the affected areas from all sides.
And you shall not abandon the patient to a good regimen and the taking of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is expelled through this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Of the cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines protrude before the hernia in the groin area, and this is the beginning of the problem, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to abstain from his normal diet for a time, and that he use soothing substances so that the opening in his abdomen subsides.
And then hold the patient's abdomen between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the hernia or intestines are fully out.
And then return it [the protrusion] with your fingers and hold the rupture over the pelvic bone, with your fingertip positioned similar to a half-circle on the sides of the body.
And then apply the cautery, of which this is the shape:
until it is very red and emits sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out again.
You have already separated the patient's thighs, placed a cushion beneath them, and another servant is positioned on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then place the cautery over that mark with your hand holding the cautery upright, and hold it until you reach the bone of the shin to the middle of the thigh; and do it again if you have not reached the bone the first time.
And carefully watch the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest the patient suffers death or some other serious harm.
And know that if, with the cautery, you do not reach the bone, your procedure is not complete.
And the cautery for children should be subtle, according to their size and proportions.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the scab from the fire has healed.
And subsequently treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and the wound are sealed.
And you must regulate their nourishment according to the length of their treatment, so as to support their stomach and prevent the intestine from protruding due to the effort of healing.
And when approximately 40 days have passed, then administer a properly made bandage, and let them wear it for another 40 days.
And he/she should be spared from work, overeating, and strong drinks, for if they follow this regimen of complete healing, they will be cured.
And I will now describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen.  If, at the beginning, you wish to prevent them from breaking open, cauterize the rupture with a rounded cautery, according to its size, and remove as much of the coagulated blood (or possibly the fibrous tissue, since that's part of a rupture and similar to "coagulated blood") as you can from the affected area; and then treat it using the methods already described, and it will not be necessary to resort to more extreme measures.
And some earlier authorities might say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, following this shape, as marked by a probe.
And a line is placed horizontally across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and one places their hand over it with a wedge-shaped cautery, although the first (triangular) cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
Of the cauterization of twisting (or torsion).
When, in some limb, pain arises due to injury or impact, and that pain persists for a long time, and you do not find a cure through medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be applied to each limb according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, the location of the twist, and the pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be marked on the limb closest to it, so that you must continue cauterizing until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some leprous individuals receive considerable benefit from cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that person, consider if the leprosy is of recent onset and can be cured with what we have discussed in the previous section, and if not, and you fear the corruption will encompass the patient's entire body and constitution, then cauterize the area on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second slightly lower, near the forehead, one near the hairline on the back of the head, and one at the base of the neck, or behind the ears (where the neck curves).
And finally, press the cautery slightly into the bone, making a small indentation, and then gently scrape the skin, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is facilitated.  Then cauterize the spleen as necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly apparent, then you must cauterize the areas mentioned for the head; use cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheek, two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one large cautery on the vertebrae near the sacrum, one on the sacrum, two on the hips, one on each hip, two on the testicles, one on each testicle, two on the thighs, two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of each foot; cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on the heel of each foot, and on the bones of the hands.
Be careful not to burn the nerves on the heel.
And sometimes, cauterization is done with one cautery on the pelvic bone, another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is.  And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cauterization, as they do from lancets, because the body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, in accordance with the instructions given about the types of instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with flour of herbs cooked with honey, and use the other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of cauterization for numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep, and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes, numbness affecting the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back, and the nerves that control that limb are cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume upon this unless you are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves throughout the moving body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of ulcers that are morphea.
When an ulcer is old and does not respond to any medicinal ointment, then cauterize it with a cautery, heating it a little according to the amount of the ulcer's depth until the whiteness and its color are gone, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils, mixed with rosemary oil and arnica leaves, and with a part of pigeon blood or swallow blood—all mixed together. Then, place a linen cloth over the area and keep it there until healed.
Chapter 50.
Of the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, just as it has spread.
And the learned ones say that it should be cauterized with the back of the cautery in the middle of the area; however, I do not see this, for I fear it might be ulcerated, and I have seen this several times.
And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized in a circle around it as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.
Chapter 11.
Of cauterization of the diseased/afflicted area.
When a diseased area is delayed in maturation, and this is due to excess, or due to the age of the patient, as they are old and frail, with little blood, or due to time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the diseased area; then cauterize in a circle around it with many small pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten in maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and you place it on the middle part of the diseased area until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a place lower down, so that the limb's condition is eased; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Of cauterization of corroding [issues/sores].
A corroding issue is a wandering corruption in the limb, which corrodes it just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if that corroding issue is in a place that tolerates cauterization with fire, then you apply cauteries made of iron, small ones for small areas, larger ones according to what is appropriate for the location of the corroding issue.
And then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply a dressing of linen soaked in mixed oil to the cauterized areas until the scabs are completely removed and all corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days the flesh grows healthy where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on those remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes it is treated with a sharp medicine, for that serves as a substitute for cautery. However, cautery with fire is a more rapid cure.
And I have already described the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division, so take it when you need it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of sores and other similar afflictions.
Often, beneath the diseased foot, a condition called a sore develops, a large, deep wound, which damages the foot; and cauterization in these cases is done in two ways: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire involves heating a concave cautery resembling a small, sharp knife, made of iron according to the size needed to cover the entirety of the sore, and made of fine, thin pieces.
And then place that heated cautery on the sore, and then rotate your hand with the cautery around the sore until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it for three days until it begins to heal. And then apply a poultice made from crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you must apply cauterization with water.  Take a cannula of brass, iron, or even vulture's bone, and place it over the sore. Then, pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula.  Hold your hand, and rotate the cannula with pressure all around, ensuring the edge of the cannula presses on the root of the sore.  The hot water will find its way to the base of the sore.  Let the patient feel the effect of the hot water for an hour.  Then remove it, as the sore, with its roots, will be eradicated.
And thus do this to these and then to the others until you have applied it to all of them that have this issue in the body.
And then treat those wounds, now that the roots of the sores are eradicated, with ointments that promote flesh regeneration.
Chapter 44.
Of cauterization for tremor.
When someone has tremor due to cold affecting the nerves, or due to a cold fever, or another similar cause, then you should cauterize that person with four cauteries, or five, on the vertebrae of their back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-oil-soaked cautery.
And the tremor of the patient will subside, and the health from the cold illness will hasten.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization for white spots/eruptions on the body.
When white spots and pustules/open sores appear on the body, caused by corrupted, thick materials, then at the beginning, as soon as it appears, it is necessary to cauterize the top of each fistula with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, the tip of which is ignited; or with long, thin root of erestology; or with a lens-shaped cautery.
And sometimes, at the beginning of its expulsion, a cautery is used in this manner; and if it is not believed, the excess is broken and healed by these means.
However, this should be done soon after bloodletting.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the cauterization of accidental blood flow by arrow-shaped incisions.
Many times there is an arrow wound that is incised toward the wound, which is outward, or toward the incision of an abscess or cauterization of the limb, and similar cases, and it is difficult to heal that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you should press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your finger over it, pressing it many times until the flow of blood is stopped under your finger, and does not reappear.
Then place in the fire the olive-oil cauteries, small and large, many in number, and blow over them until they are quite ignited.
Then take one of those, small or large, depending on the area and the wound where the artery is broken, quickly placing it over the vein after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is cauterized and constricted.
And if blood is expelled from the artery opening when you remove your finger and press the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from the cauteries that are prepared in the fire, and do not stop doing this one after another until the blood is constricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and that another harm comes upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to constrict the blood, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it is not already extracted, because when it is extracted the ends of it are burned and the blood is constricted, or that it be bound with a thread or a bandage with a tight constriction, or that medicaments whose virtue is to constrict the blood be placed upon it; and be constricted by a cushion with a proper constriction.
However, the one who administers a proper constriction with a bandage and a tight wrap with cloths or by placing burning or similar substances, will only achieve success slowly.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor isn't present, nor is medicine available, then proceed with gently pressing the indicated finger on the opening of that vein, as we have said, and make a strong constriction until the blood is stopped from its outflow from the wound, and the finger is not removed from the artery.  Above the artery, sprinkle it with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and afterwards look into whether cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incisions and perforations, and cupping, and phlebotomy, and wounds, and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter all illnesses in which cautery with fire is suitable and with comburent medicine, and their occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments with the forms of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the supremacy of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way, so that the seeker of this may be relieved, therefore concerning what he has requested.
And before I begin this, children, it is necessary that you understand that in this chapter it is similar to what is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And for this, great caution is required, because in the operation described in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs, which is with blood, from which life depends, such as the incision of a vein, or an incision over an abscess, or the opening of a wound, or the cleaning of a sore, or the removal of an arrow, or the incision of a stone, and similar procedures. And all of those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in their hands lies death.
And I warn you that this should not befall you, for sometimes you will encounter the ways of men with many illnesses. And of them is some who will rage against their illness, and death is near them, and this is due to the intensity of their illness, and because of the duration of their illness, and with the illness is fear that signifies death.
And of those is the one who gives you their wealth and says, "You are hoping for their health," and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to those who come to you with such a condition; your caution should be greater than your greed and your haste; and do not presume any cause upon this without certain knowledge which verifies this for you and upon which a praiseworthy outcome is based.
Use prognosis and indication of the path to health in the treatment of all your patients, for in that is assistance for you in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold direction and protection from you, for that is in his hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by sections as was preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the treatment of the head to the feet, so that what you seek and need regarding this may be made easier for you.
First chapter.
Of the treatment of water which is contained in the head of children.
Know that this illness often comes to children after childbirth and when the nurse tightly holds the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it arises due to a hidden cause that is unknown.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those I saw, death resulted, and thus it seems to me to be a hopeless case for them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was constantly swollen until he could no longer support himself due to the size of his head, and that the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the bone and the skin, or it collects below the bone on the spine.
When the operation is on that area where the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should cut open the middle part of the head with a slit, the slit's length being about two inches until the moisture flows out.  This is the method of the "spatum.
And therefore, if the moisture is more extensive and the abscess larger, then there are two slits in this manner:
And if the moisture is below the bone, the sign of this is that you see the seams of the head open on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand in all directions; this is not hidden from you. You should cut open the middle part of the head with three slits in this manner:
Then remove all the moisture through the incisions.  Then, bind the incisions with cloths and bandages. Then, cover this with wine and oil until the fifth day. Then, loosen the bandages and treat the wound with dressings and ointments.  Keep the head compressed evenly.  The patient should eat dry, low-moisture foods until the affected part is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, where you consider the size of the abscess and the collection of water, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore, with the incision, aim for where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do this as best you can.
And be careful not to cut the artery, for if blood flows and the patient dies from that blood flow with the evacuation of the moisture.
Second Chapter.
When there is chronic inflammation or swelling in the eyes or foot, and the usual medications are ineffective, then the final cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incise those [arteries], if the patient is turning their head, rub the area with a rough cloth so the arteries are exposed, then firmly hold the patient's neck with a cloth; then, consider where the vein pulses; and locate the spots of each [artery] near the ears, and in some men they are hidden.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each with a sharp scalpel, making an incision that reaches the bone, and this should be done at the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and cut it in those places above.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers joined together, because when any vein is incised, the blood flows out with pulsating egress, which leaps out in frequent jumps.
But if the artery is not visible, then you must measure the distance of three fingers from the ear, and then mark it with a probe and proceed to the bone.
And the amount of blood to be drawn is about a wine-unc (a unit of volume), and more or less may be drawn from it, and all this depends on the patient's condition and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of inflammation remains on the bone, then cut away that so that a painful abscess does not develop later.
And then bandage the wound with lint and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
When someone experiences chronic migraines or sudden severe headaches, due to irritating moisture and inflammation in the temple region, or a persistent severe headache similar to those, and is treated using standard medical methods, and this does not help, then we have found in these cases that the extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have shown, is helpful.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those arteries is that the patient shaves the hair on their temples; and locate the artery visible in the temple area, as it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden from all but a few skilled persons due to its severity.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's head should be held firmly with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water until the artery is clearly visible to you. And then you take the instrument, of which this is the shape: And then you gently scrape the skin with that instrument until you reach the artery; and then cut around it, and extract it from its surroundings completely, until you extract the artery from the skin and expose those tissues that lay beneath.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with the tip of the instrument, and then cut a portion of it, proportionate to the length of its extension and contraction,  so that the blood flow does not increase, for if not cut, the blood will not fully recede.
And then evacuate the blood by one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with strong double-twisted linen thread or long cords, and do not cut it before the wound's healing to prevent blood flow.
And then cut away the excess tissue between the two ligaments; and do this at this time or at a later time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the bone is reached, or with a sharp cautery until its extremities are cut, and the work will be in the same place.
And it is better if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a heated temperament; for cautery is of those things that help dispel the excess moisture, and so it is better for helping this.
And it is necessary after the removal of the arteries, that the area be filled with old cotton, and that powdered medicines be placed over it, and then be treated with dry remedies that promote flesh growth and with poultices until it is healed.
And if during the work, blood flows again from the artery, then you must endeavor to stop that blood, either with a cautery or by filling the area with cotton, and pressing firmly with your hand until the bleeding stops. And if none of those things are available to you, then press your finger over the area until the bleeding stops, and apply water with a strong cold to the area until the flow subsides and the area is adequately constricted.
And the easiest method for extracting an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two knives, since you have marked the two points with a probe and place each one, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities of the artery is lengthened, because it is not entirely consolidated by this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two knives be equal. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two knives, it is better, for if it is sharp like two knives, it will cause a strong burn on each side, and will not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, because there is some thickness in those [areas], the heat of the fire is contained there and the flesh is cut easily.
And this work is better in every work and more easily done.
And let the space between the two knives be the width of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of bodies afflicted by sharp and acidic humors of the oils.
When the humors are acidic, and the body's veins around the top of the head are affected, and you find no medicinal cause for treatment, and the patient's face begins to redden, and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead as if ants were crawling, and the oils of the affected area are weakened, damp, and their skin is visibly affected, and the eyelids are irritated by the acidity of the tears, the ancient physicians, in the treatment of these cases, used a particular method, and named that treatment "spassa.
And you command the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead along the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers' width: the first incision should be equidistant from the nose to the middle of the forehead, the second should be a little less than the length from the movement of the eyelids next to the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the blood vessels that are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both the jaws. And if the space between each incision is the width of three fingers.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to absorb the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of the incision: which is from the side of the temples to the second incision. Scrape away all the clot that is between the two incisions with the spatula which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then withdraw this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp edge of this against the flesh adjacent to the clot, and the blunt edge on the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the heels.
But continue the incision to this extent from the clot, and then do this in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And since a quantity of congealed blood flows, express the places of the congealed blood clots.
Then place in each fissure a piece of old cloth, and place on them powders mixed in wine, oil, and sour wine, and take care that it does not become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of hot or lukewarm water, and then treat this with basil ointment with rubbed oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the treatment of sores (or wounds) by means of cauterization and for wounds descending from the parts within the head.
When a patient has sharp and persistent cauterization, and the wounds of the sufferer are small and weakened, and the care of them is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and hair falls from them, and there is acute pain and consequent exhaustion at the front of the head, then understand from these symptoms that the matter and cauterization come only from inflamed veins in the parts within [the head].
And the best treatment in such cases is this: command the patient to lie face down, and then make an incision in the middle of their forehead, a small one in width (and begin with an incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision go through to the bone; and keep your hand away from the lacerations of the temples, which are prone to damage to the jaw), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the two sides of the incision with old cloth or bandages. And then press on top with powders mixed in wine and oil, so that a painful abscess does not form.
And when you have done this and see that the abscess has begun to diminish, then it is necessary to rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh, in the same way that if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and make a plaster from them and apply it to these wounds for the generation of flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what afflicts the ears.
Every affliction of the ears belongs to one of four types: either it is a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron or glass; or it is from a plant, such as a thistle or a bean; or it is a flowing substance, such as water and sour wine and their like; or some kind of animal.
And therefore, when a stone or other similar substance that does not grow or adhere to the ear enters the ear, and you place the ear in the sun, and the stone moves, then instill into it some kind of olive oil or saffron, and then apply a technique of extraction, and make the person sneeze with a remedy, and close the nostrils during the sneezing event. Then place some cloths or wool around the ear, and gently stretch the ear outward, for frequently these things are driven out by these methods.
And if it is not expelled, then apply extraction using the instrument called a *gesti epicicarios* (a subtle/delicate extraction tool) of which this is the shape:
And if it is expelled with the instrument, it is good; and if not, then apply extraction with a small, thin probe (a small, slender, slightly curved probe).
And if it is not expelled by that, then make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole and seal around the tube with softened wax and oil so that only the tube is open. And then pull it out with your hand with strong traction, for frequently with this method it is extracted.
But if it is not expelled in this way, then take a heated splint or a similar device with which birds are caught, a small quantity, and place this on the affected area, and then wrap the splint gently around it. And then carefully insert that into the ear canal, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then you should consider cutting it out before it develops into a painful abscess or spasm.
And the method of cutting it out is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and draw blood according to the patient's constitution, and then make an incision with your hands and turn the ear towards the upper parts, and make a small cut at the base of the ear near the patient's head in a well-pressed area. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone, and, finding the stone, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision quickly, and treat it until it heals.
And if the cause of the affliction in the ear is a growth that swells and is inflamed, then administer the cure and extraction of it; but if you do not succeed in this way, then you should take a subtle, thin poultice, following this method: And apply that to remove the growth that has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this if you think that it is already moistened by the ear's vapor, but rather put it into small pieces, and carefully extract them with your nails or with subtle manipulations, or with a cut as we have mentioned, because extraction will be easier that way.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should initially use sneezing remedies, and fill their ear with some old cloth, and lie down on the side of the affected ear, if this expels the water, that's good; and if not, then take small, smooth stones, the length of your finger, warm them slightly in the fire, and the patient inserts one into the ear canal, puts their foot on that side, and strikes the stone inside the ear with another stone. So continue this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
So continue this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And once the water is expelled, you should take paper or linen, place one end in the ear and hold the other end to a fire until it burns at the ear's opening.
And then put more linen there and repeat this as many times as needed until all the water is expelled, and remove it using a tube, as was described above for removing the stone.
But in the case of a small animal entering the ear, such as a tick or similar, treat it as we described in the previous section. However, if a larger creature causing swelling is in the ear, remove it with instruments and hooks. This is the easiest of all the things that can enter the ear.
But in removing a worm that has grown inside the ear, if you treat it as described in the section on distillations and your treatment doesn't work, then you should expose the ear to the sun.
And therefore, if any worm-like object is present, remove it with delicate instruments or hooks.  However, if nothing is visible, take a tube that is narrow at the bottom and wider at the top, which is shaped like this: Insert the narrow end of the tube into the ear, according to how much the patient can tolerate; then, suck strongly with the tube, repeating this many times until all the worms are removed.
But if it doesn't respond to this treatment, then apply a plug of wax to the tube's opening, as we have described.  Then, apply distillations that have been proven effective against worms in the treatment of worms, which can be found in the treatise on distillations.
And your application should be using the instrument to pour medicinal oils into the ear, the instrument's shape being like this: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and a flat top.
And therefore, it should be fitted to the cavity of the tube so it is continuously present where needed. And if you wish, take a reed, wrap its end properly with cotton, then pour oil into the cavity of the ear, or the juice of any herb, or whatever other medicine you choose into the tube—and that is in the ear—then gently insert the reed with the cotton on top and press with your hand until the oil has been forced into the ear's cavity, and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is put into the ear should be warmed slightly with fire. And be careful that the substance you are distilling into the ear is not too cold, for ear remedies cannot tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Of the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children inherit this from their mothers' unperforated wombs, and this also occurs in some men, a blockage in the ear canal due to a plaque or a growth within; and this blockage is sometimes formed at the entrance of the ear canal which prevents drainage, and sometimes is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the entrance, which does not allow drainage, is in the most difficult cases to cure.
And in those cases where drainage is possible, you should place the patient's ear towards the sun and watch it. And therefore if a blockage appears, open it with a subtle instrument, of which this is the form:
If its end has a small width, with one part sharp and the other not; and the instrument has two thin strands so that it does not injure the ear.
And therefore if the blockage is due to flesh growing in the ear or its canal, then remove it with fine forceps, cutting out the flesh with forceful ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the front of the ear, then take a thin, sharp reed and slightly warm it over a fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have sensed a blockage that the patient finds difficult due to the difficulty of hearing, ease the blockage with care; and be careful not to harm the nerves of the ear.
Then place a cloth of a size fitting the hole you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing, or you take a poultice and place it in boiling water, pulverise it over, and use it; and if the ear is already suppurated, then you must remove the poultice and replace it with another poultice wrapped in a compress made of roasted oil, until the abscess subsides; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cool water and place it on the ear, and use another treatment that constricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on bleeding.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of a boil that forms on the eyelids.
Boils that appear on the eyelids of the eyes sometimes are moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or tweezers, and cut them away from their roots, and then apply a poultice to the areas.
But if pain with blood flow occurs, then cauterize those areas with a thin, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is done near the incisions, and often they return if any part of the roots remain; and when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids.
Often in the eyelids there is some cause which resembles a swelling in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called swelling.
And it is a collection of thick moisture on the eyelid below and above.
Therefore, the operation for them is to consider whether the swelling is proceeding from within the eyelid and is spreading in all directions; and its cause is slight.
Therefore, make a slit across it in the width, and then gently scrape it from all sides until it opens, and then suspend it with a forceps and cut it.
And if the figure (swelling) is large, then you adjust it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not experience any harm from it, because the ointment will restore it and cause it to heal.
And if the swelling is located towards the inner parts of the eyelid, near the surface inside, then lift the eyelid and suspend the swelling with forceps, in order to make an incision, and press on it from all sides.  And if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, this causes no harm.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with something that promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the treatment of a boil on the eyelid above the eye.
A boil is a painful swelling that forms in the eyelid tissues above the eye, and it's particularly common in children.  It irritates the eyes of those afflicted and frequently causes them discomfort in the morning.  They cannot look at the sunlight due to this, and their eyes become watery.
And therefore, you see them lying on their faces constantly, sleeping on their faces.  The eyelids below their eyebrows are swollen, and the presence of a boil is apparent near the eye.  And when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the boil within them.
And a method of treatment is that the patient rests their head on your lap, and you place a cloth over them and apply heat.  Make a circle around the boil that encompasses the entire swelling, and place that over it, pressing with your fingers to force the boil to the center of the circle.  Then, make a small incision in the center of the inflamed area, using a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than the one made in a bloodletting procedure.
But in the incision, you must break open the skin entirely until you reach the boil, for in many cases the boil is caused by a white pus-like substance.
Then remove that [pus] with cloths that you have wrapped between your fingers, working it out and turning it between your right and left hands until it is gone.
And be careful not to push too hard into the incision with the lancet, so that you do not pierce the boil and damage it.
But if the boil does not appear at the beginning of the incision, but rather you must push a little into the incision with ease until pus comes out; then remove it as we have said; then soak cloths in warm water and vinegar and place them over the area and bind them with powders.
And some sprinkle salt and place it in the cavity of the incision, to absorb any remaining moisture.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if you encounter a hot abscess in the area, then treat it with cooling plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of ways of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural skin, and they become hardened,  these press on the eye and cause various illnesses, like constant tears and softening of the eyelids and tissues, until this becomes the cause of the eye's destruction, which is called 'tactimir' of the eye.  It is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization; or it is treated by incision and suturing; or by using canes, as I will describe.
And therefore you should place the patient's head on your lap; then, gently hold the eyelid with your left hand, and if it's already repositioned, good.  Otherwise, insert a needle under the eyelid, where the tissue is most prominent beneath, and push the needle through, with the thread above it. Do this close to the edge of the eyelid, near the base of the hairs.  Pull the thread up and out from beneath the eyelid, and reposition the eyelid using the needle.
Then, using a sharp instrument, cut into the tissue under the eyelid's hairs, from the main tear duct down to the smaller one.  Then, remove the thread and place small, powdered cotton or cloth under the eyelid.  Next, gently compress the eyelid with a bandage, forming it into a shape like a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be adjusted according to how much the eyelid is raised, as this varies greatly between individuals; some require a larger portion of the eyelid to be cut, according to the amount of swelling.
And then use the instrument on the two lines you have drawn, starting from the main tear duct and moving towards the smaller one. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, it should be as large as the king's finger.
Then place the bone forceps at one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape that entire area.  Next, using suture material (like fine wool thread), bring the two edges of the wound together. Clean the blood away, and if desired, use any available sticky substance to glue any excess thread or material to the two eyebrows. Otherwise, don't worry about it.
And leave the sutures in place for three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised towards the sealing of the wound and its adhesion; but sutures are better.  Therefore, the ancient physicians say this.
However, be diligent in your care of the patient, and it is a good procedure, and there is no need for fear.
There is another method in treating this, which is to shape the eyelid like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three separate and joined forceps, in this shape:
However, if this is not possible, hold the forceps, and if this is not suitable, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other suture near the major lacrimal duct, and the second suture near the minor lacrimal duct, and join the sutures equally between your fingers, and then lift your hand with a lifting motion, lifting the entire skin flap in the shape described.
Then bring the two edges of the wound together with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if an abscess arises near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with poultices and similar remedies, and with ointments.
And sometimes the eyelashes turn inward at the eyelid; then you should use what we have said about incision on that, but sutures are more suitable in each case.
To treat with canes is according to this form: And you are to turn the eyelid and cut the figure inside as I have described; and then, with skill, make two thin canes or splints whose length is equal to the length of the eyelid and whose width is smaller than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you hold the threads.
Then carefully attach each one to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly bind the canes to each part, and leave it for some days, because the flesh will die and become useless and rotten until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised and the skin is not sore.
And this is the method for two canes, which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of lifting sore skin in the eye with a needle when the skin is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough hairs, irritating the eye, then the operation on it is that you take a fine needle and place it on that fine linen cloth, and then you adjust the extremities of it, and tie each end very subtly. And the length of the threads should be about the length of one palm.
And then you attach another fine thread below it, and tie the ends of that if you wish.
And then position the patient's head on your lap, and close to the sun so that your work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then, insert the needle into the root of the hair that needs to be removed, and pierce the eyelid quickly until you pull that hair out over the natural hair.
And then pull the hair out over the top and place it in the container, and there should be one or two or three hairs, but no more.
And then pull your hand with that until the hair is removed, along with any other hairs adhering to the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the follicle is pulled but the hair isn't removed, you will pull the follicle in different directions with the ointment you prepared, until the follicle is removed from the opening.
And you will observe this with the eye's vision.  Then you will remove the follicle and the ointment, and everyone will clean and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a longer hair from the natural hairs, and raise it with that, or leave it until it has grown to a reasonable length, and then you raise that.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of a scratch that occurs on the upper eyelid.
When a scratch appears on the eye, and there is a contraction of the eyelid, whether on the upper, right or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cauterization, and it is called leporine, this scratch or abrasion is either natural or accidental and is caused by the poor healing of wounds, incisions, or cauterizations, or similar ill-treated injuries.
The method of treatment in such cases is to break apart the scar tissue and separate the edges, and place a piece of soft linen between them, and bandage them until healed.
And you should not use treatments that dry out or constrict it, for if you do this, the scratch will return worse than ever before.
Use remedies that soften it, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice made from water in which mallow and linseed have been boiled, or diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil, and soak a piece of cloth in it and treat it with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you should break open any unhealed part according to its initial shape.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing more than a correction of a scar that does not restore the area to its original form.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the treatment of a scar on the lower eyelid.
This scar on the lower eyelid, truly called a scar, may be either of natural or accidental origin.
But an accidental scar is caused by a wound, or a cut, or a cautery, or other similar injuries.
And the method of its treatment is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and pass it from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then, gently pull the flesh apart with the needle and stitch it together with the needle, and cut with a wide spatula. And so if the eyelid's shape returns as necessary, it is good; and if not, take a strip of cloth and place it in the split, and with that, reposition the eyelid, and close the two gaps on the lower eyelid's edge.
And let the ends of the two slits, which you have made, be the two angles of the incision, until they meet, and let their joining make a shape when they come together.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then remove the flesh that is on the lower sharp edge of the eyelid.
And then join the separated parts together with the wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medicines and poultices we mentioned until healed.
And if a repair is required through a slit, suture, or cautery, then you must make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid, as previously described. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In summary of the treatment for a displaced eyelid, whether above or below, let the operation proceed according to the preparation of the displaced eyelid, and this is in various forms.
And the skilled craftsman always prepares each possible manner until he restores the figure to its natural form, or nearly so, and the patient, according to what is appropriate for the operation and the instruments in the best arrangements.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in such a way that the eyelid is firmly glued to the white part of the eye, and prevented from its natural movement and functions, then you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid, and lift it up, or extend it with forceps.
And then you carefully cut the adhesion with a thin blade, not excessively sharp, so the patient isn't distressed by the procedure, and leave the blade so it doesn't injure the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should be precise enough to easily sever the adhesion, until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is removed.
And then you apply salt water to the eye, with which you wash it; or apply distilled vinegar dissolved in water.
And then you gently separate the eyelid from the eye, and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye, and then on the third day use healing agents until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of incisions of the nail and the protruding flesh of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types: either it is nervous, and resembles a hard, fine chip; or it is non-nervous, resembling frozen white moisture, which when touched by an iron, or if forced to be taken with forceps, is separated and the forceps are not stuck to it.
And both types do not originate from anywhere but the large tear duct, until it gradually grows to cover the eye and blocks the light and movement of the eye.
But the way to proceed with its incision is that the patient places their head on your shoulder, then open their eyes wide, raise the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with forceps of little leverage and pull it away from the surrounding tissue. Then take a needle and insert into it a horse, ox, or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or repeatedly thin the end of the needle and place it in the middle of the nail, penetrating it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and pull it away from the surrounding tissue, and scrape the nail bed with the hair, which is touching the pupil. And thus you remove it with the hair until the back of it.
And then you cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a very thin scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the tear duct intact so that by cutting it, there is no continuous flow of tears.
Sometimes the nail with only forceps, or with thread, as we have said, and then be scraped with a lion's scalpel, of which this is its shape:
And be careful that with the scalpel you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then put a little crushed salt or a prepared powder in the wound, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with whatever is necessary until it heals.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it embedded in the nail bed, then often this type of nail is treated with medicines and healed as I have described in the division.
And if you want to dissect it, then you open the patient's wound and take a sharp, fine lion's scalpel of this shape: with subtlety. And if it is often inflamed and festering and has pus in it, then distil from your flask into the wound a prepared powder, or with rose water, or with crushed salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the operation until all that is pus is removed, unless a hot abscess remains in the wound; in that case, leave it, and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with care until it is healed.
If an inflammation of the tear ducts is found in the wound causing great discomfort, it should be suspended with a bandage; and cut a small portion of the inflamed area, but do not cut too deep, so as to avoid causing a flow of tears.
And then instill into the tear duct rose water and prepared powder until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of boils and of what arises from inflamed flesh in the wound.
Sometimes in the wounds of some people red flesh grows and spreads until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or tightens around the eyelids, and forcefully compresses the eyelids on the outside, resembling a row of small towers (or a balustrade).
But the procedure for him is that the patient rests his head on your lap; then open the wounds and gather all that flesh with appropriate forceps, and hold it with a forceps or pliers; then cut the flesh at the beginning until it is all finished with the scalpel, and be careful not to damage the wound during your procedure.
And your incision should be with the same instrument with which we described the incision of the nail, or with small forceps, with which the flesh is gathered according to the form required by this chapter.
Thus, when your incision is complete and all that flesh has been removed, then fill the wound with crushed salt, or apply red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place a poultice of egg white over the wound until a safe, suppurating healing has occurred.
And if any pus or foul blood remains, and you fear a suppurating abscess, then leave the wound and treat the abscess with whatever will resolve the abscess, and then again operate on it until it is healed.  Do likewise with the adhering flesh that you find in the wound of this kind.
However, you should avoid any treatment of the wound through natural or accidental means, such as using iron, and do not put your hand on any of these procedures until you see that the limb can tolerate that operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus in the wound.
Pus that forms, red and thick on the wound, and prevents its healing, and should be cleaned from the wound for many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the wound containing pus is strong and there is no other illness than pus, then you collect that pus.
And you command the patient to place their head on your lap, and then suspend those veins with a bandage or two, according to your judgment; and let that bandage be of a subtle double layer in this manner:
or two bandages gradually wrapped together in this manner:
Then gently collect those veins with subtle force, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins to be removed from the wound and are rolled up.
And be careful not to damage the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is in the middle of the day before the sun, be very firm in your operation so that you only cut those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill green or red vinegar into the wound, so that with its sharpness it corrodes what is left of the pus.
But if it is not possible for you to collect everything at that time, then you bandage everything with what relieves his pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is relieved and a hot abscess is assured.
And then repeat according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the shears:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nasal injury.
When you treat a nasal injury with a cautery or a sharp, burning medicine, according to the narrative that preceded it, and it is not healed, then there is no use in it, but you should make incisions on the abscess to promote its maturation, and remove all the moisture and pus from it until the bone is exposed.
And therefore, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness there, then you scrape it with an instrument whose shape is this:
And it is called a "sharp head," and it is made of iron, and the head is round like a nut, which is made pointed by puncturing with a file or a chisel (like in the following illustration).
And place that on the corrupted area of the bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And do this several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated, and good flesh has grown there, and the body is free from pus and remains for 40 days, and is not renewed and no abscess or accident occurs there, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a true cure, but rather to reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and in this manner:  and you must expose the second bone with iron or with sharp medicine, and once the bone is exposed, then you take a strip according to this shape:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and the shaft be thin and tapered towards the tip like this (or, in this way).
Then place that on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand a little away from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the strip until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient feels air escaping when you move their hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent, drying medicines, as was shown to you.
Then, as the flesh heals and the area hardens, the material that spread outwards returns to the nose, so this is easier for the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and you observe no harm or diminution in vision, then you should leave the patient alone, and then follow it, and then apply leeches to the neck without incision and suck thoroughly; and then apply a liniment made of aconite, aloe, and incense and sarcocolla to the eye, and then press the plaster on the eye with many powders.
And the method for the powders is to take very thin linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four folds; and make many of these.
And then place those cloths one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs. And then press on those with a firm cloth with strong pressure; and repeat the leeches with suction without incision; and then remove the leeches and keep the eye tightly covered day and night.
But if meanwhile the swelling has softened, then it should be very tightly bound.
And then remove the bandage every day and night, as we have said.
And if you see the eye already reduced, good; and if not, then repeat the poultice with powders, the pressure, and the leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the prominence of the uvea (or vascular layer of the eye).
When a rupture occurs in the uvea, and it is protruding and has become apparent outside the eyelids, resembling a grape cluster, and you wish to incise it, then the operation in that location is as we have described, that you insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then place another needle, on which there is a double thread from the tear duct area, and cause that to penetrate and let the first needle follow its path; and then you cut the spot where the double thread is, and with that thread you lift the portion of the uvea that surrounds the needle, and hold it firmly.
And then remove the needle and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white and leave it until the thread comes away with the grape-like protrusion.
And then treat the eye with that which strengthens it until the injury is healed.
And sometimes, gathering from all sides with a circular cloth, a large protruding area in the eye is contained, and then it is pierced with a fine needle that reaches the surface of the eye, and the white fluid flows out, and the eye descends and quickly recedes inward.
And then hold it firm until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of blindness.
This illness, called blindness, is nothing but a fluid that gathers in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, and then grasp their head with both your hands, and gently hold it until you see the fluid descend to the lower parts, and then it is dried up and does not descend, and the light is restored, and the patient sees things as before.
And if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid is not prepared by what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands, and then take a fine, soft, and gentle substance, and apply it over the affected area, just inside the transition between the conjunctiva and the cornea (on the empty part), until the fluid is expelled.
Then, once it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye, in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and which ones should be pierced with a lancet, declaring the reason, then according to the health.
Then you should place the patient between your hands on a bed, and tightly bandage the eye.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their affected eye, if the eye with the water is the left eye; or with your right hand if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then place the tip of the almond near the brow bone, along the thickness of the eyebrow, in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller tear duct, and then press on the almond gently and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has now reached the empty space.
And the distance from the almond to the [desired] point should be the same as the distance between the pupil and the end of the black part [the iris], which is the brow bone of the eye; for you will see through that pupil, through the clarity of the cornea, with the vision of the eye.
And then place the almond into the area where the water [presumably fluid] is, and then pull it down a couple of times, and if the fluid descends immediately, then you see the patient immediately focus their vision on it, and the almond is in their eye.
And then rest for a little while; if the fluid has descended, then you pause again before the almond is thrown.
And then, if it is dried up and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently rub it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it; and then apply to the outside of the eye lint or a bandage soaked in warmed oil and egg white and bandage the eye.
But we, and those of our time, put [something] on that crushed [substance] with egg white.
And if you cannot move your almond into the eye due to its hardness—for in some people the eye is very hard—then it is necessary to take the substance called *alberid*, of which this is the form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva with that, and do not insert your hand into the opening, and only do so to make a subtle path for the almond.
And then insert the almond, as we have said.
And then the completion of your work should be that the patient is prepared in a properly made sleeping chamber where they sleep on their back in a dark room, and all movement is forbidden.
And place this upon him in a way that his nature will be soothed, and he will not move his head to either the right or left at all.
And let the ligament be according to its disposition until the third day.
And then, remove it from that dark room, and remove the painful sight, and have him see some things, and then return the ligament until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the time of the cures or immediately after the infusion. Having done this, you should remove it, because water can easily be strong and forceful during observation.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the poultice before the seventh day, and treat it with whatever reduces the abscess.
Then you remove his sight and place a bandage over his face, through which his vision is directed downwards for several days, him remaining in the dark room.
And gradually he is released from that room and returned to his usual activities.
And know that in an emergency, the student is not excused from examining certain cases, and then you should be bold in your operation.
And it has already come to our attention that some of those who are in the Artach, and some said that a fire was made in the Ayrac, a large hole through which water was drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of the types of magdaam, so that the one who is ignorant of them may understand them:
And they should be made of iron or steel, precisely, and their extremities should have this triangular subtlety, the sharp end thus forming the shape.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various growths of flesh arise in the nose, some of which are caused by something akin to a very heavy scorpion or a large polyp; and this illness is called polyps because it resembles that depicted fish. And from it is cancerous flesh, ulcerated, dark colored; and from it is flesh that is like a lion, not of dark color.
Therefore, for that flesh which is leonine, not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands, exposed to the sun, and open the patient's nostrils, and pierce the affected flesh with your lancet. And then extract that outwardly, and then separate what you have grasped of it with a sharp, thin, pointed instrument, one piece at a time, until you know that all the flesh has been removed; that if any part of it remains from which excision is possible, then you should cut that away with one of the thin instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it is swollen with blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then cauterize and cut it until the blood is extracted and all cavities are cleared.
And then, after the incision, put vinegar and water, or wine, into the nose. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then you know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is still unremoved flesh in the pus, surrounding the bones of the nose, which have not been reached by the excision.
Therefore, you should introduce some thick, fatty material, and put many little pieces of it, placing the quantity of a finger or less between each piece.  Apply this to the patient and insert one end of the fatty substance into the nose, using a probe or any other suitable tool.
And after doing this, stimulate the patient's sense of smell until it reaches the nasal passages, and exits through their throat, for many times children are taught this at school and it is an easy thing to do.
Then hold the two ends of the fatty substance, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining inside, and carefully separate the flesh with the pieces of fat.  Continue doing this until you see that the flesh is entirely surrounded by the fatty material.
Then remove the fat, and apply a poultice to the nose near the area where the blood was drawn.  Do this for three days or more, until the poultice has dissolved any remaining flesh.
And finally, insert a lead cannula into the nose for several days until healing is complete.
But if you require a more thorough cure, use this method.
And this is the form of the instrument for nasal purging, with which oils and medicines are instilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or brass, resembling a small, open lamp, or a small shell, and the opening similar.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a reed, and the cannula of the nasal purging instrument be flat, open; to which there should be a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when heating oil or whatever juices and subtle substances you desire within it.
Chapter 25.
Of ointments applied to the nostrils.
Often an ointment is applied to the nostrils, and it is applied and augmented over several days until the healing of the area is very obvious.
And therefore you should intervene at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. And then place on the affected area either a cautery or a burning medicine that is suitable for that spot.
However, if its removal is delayed until it has become large, then consider if it is hardened, tough, dark in color, and insensitive.  If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a deep-seated abscess; because often the one who cuts into this abscess will cause great harm to the person who had it.
And if the abscess is easily touched and is not dark in color, and incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with that which dries and constricts it until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when the continuity is broken by plague or similar causes.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, little success is achieved in this operation except in some men.
Therefore, when encountering such a cause, consider if it is fresh plague with its own blood, and if so, you should join the two sides of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the break in continuity are already separated and each is healthy, then you must scrape each part of its apparent scab until blood comes out. Then, join the two edges with sutures and tighten them.  Dust the sutures with powdered dragon's blood and crushed herbs, and place a piece of diaphanous plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, over the powder. Leave it bound for two or three days, and then remove it, replace the plaster, and leave it until the pus is gone.  Then treat with ointment until healed.
But the method of suturing is that you either join the break in continuity with needles, as we have described in suturing the belly, or join the break in continuity with glue, as you have been taught.
Chapter 27.
Of extracting those things that appear between the two edges within the parts.
Often, hard abscesses resembling lumps of fat appear inside the lips in some men's mouths, and some are smaller and others are larger.
Therefore, you should separate the lips and cut away each of those hardnesses from all sides, and then fill the space with scraped sage until the blood is stopped, and then wash the area with sour wine and treat it with something astringent until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, flesh adhering to the gums, which the ancients called albulus, forms on the gum. Then, you should detach it with forceps or cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to drain.
And then place on the area scraped sage or other astringent or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then you must cut it again and cauterize it, for the cautery will not allow it to return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning toothache with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, there are hard, rough, black, and sometimes yellow or greenish crusts, which cause corruption in the gums and the teeth become decayed.
And thus, you must have the patient sit between your hands, and rest the patient's head on your lap, and scrape the teeth where those crusts and similar dark things appear, until no trace of them remains, and do this for the blackness, yellowness and other discolorations until they are cleaned.
Therefore, if that which is on those teeth at the beginning of the procedure has been removed, good.  But if not, then repeat the procedure on them the following day, and the second, and the third, until it reaches the desired state.
And know that teeth require many different kinds of scrapers and various shapes depending on your preparation for the operation. And therefore, the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the inner part is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, with other shapes, and these scraper shapes must be prepared for you, which you will see soon.
Chapter 30.
Of the eradication of teeth.
You should treat the tooth's pain with all diligence and take your time with any tooth extraction, for there is no remedy that can replace the tooth's functionality when extracted, as it is a sublimated substance that needs consideration in the extraction process.
However, when the patient insists on having that tooth extracted, you must be absolutely certain which tooth is the painful one, for many times the pain deceives the patient, suggesting it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one. Then the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have seen this in the practice of barbers.
Therefore, how should you be certain which tooth is the painful one, and that you know it well?  Then you must scarify the area around the tooth with a substance possessing some virtue, until it has loosened the tooth from the gum on every side. Then, gently remove it with your fingers, or with fine scissors, beginning small and gradually until you have extracted it.
And afterward, if needed use strong forceps for better grip or firmness, and place the patient's head between your knees to hold it steady so it doesn't move. Then, carefully pull out the tooth in a straight manner, so as not to break it, and to avoid causing further pain to the patient.
And therefore, if it is not fully dislodged, then take one of those instruments and place it beneath the tooth from all sides with ease, and exert the removal in the same manner as the initial attempt.
However, if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you must fill that crack with cloth and tighten it with the tip of a thin stick, so that it is not broken during your application of forceps.
And you must carefully open the surrounding gum with scarification from all sides, and be very careful to avoid breaking it and leaving a portion of it, lest you cause more pain to the patient than the initial pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their eagerness and rashness when extracting teeth, without following what we have described; for many times they cause serious illnesses in people, which are even harder to treat than the initial problem, leaving the roots entirely or partially embedded, or pulling the teeth out with some of the jawbone as we have often witnessed.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be rinsed with warm wine or vinegar with salt.
And if there is bleeding from this, as often happens, then apply a small quantity of alum to the wound, and if that doesn't stop the bleeding, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers used to remove the tooth at the beginning should be of a long end, a short and thick handle, so they don't bend when using them.
And they should be like thick handles so that when you squeeze with them they don't bend; the ends should be short.
And they should be made of Indian steel, with straight ends; on the ends of these are teeth which interlock and grip tightly by constriction.  Sometimes the ends of these are shaped like the beak of a stork (i.e., a kind of hook), and are very strong and constricting.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you need to remove a broken tooth that still remains, you should place a compress with a poultice on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; then use forceps, the ends of which are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or guanta (i.e., forceps).
Their ends should be made smooth like a file or a rasp.
And if you cannot remove it with these forceps or pliers, then you must cut into the root and expose all the flesh and insert the tool called a small lever, which is shaped like this:
And it should have a short, thick end, a little bit thick, and not be too thin so it won't break.
So, if the root is now fully exposed, good.  If not, use these other tools, of which these are the shapes: the first tool has a triangular end, of which there is some thickness:
The shape of the second tool should be triangular, with a more slender end.
And having helped with this tool, with two ramps whose form is as follows: and with other tools, which I will describe in the section on tooth scraping; for a good job is done using this instrument, which resembles a large scoop, and this is its shape:
with a triangular, curved or short end, with some thickness, and not too blunt so that it is not broken.
And further, know that the tools for teeth are similar to the other tools.
But the skilled and subtle craftsman in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not prescribe or give a specific tool, due to the diverse forms of these illnesses.
However, if the jawbone or other bones in the mouth are fractured, or decayed, then apply a steady pressure on it in its place, using appropriate tools and forceps, which we have described in the extraction of tooth roots, and assist it with a maneuver which is done like this:
And apply a little pressure gradually, and keep it held in the mouth so that it does not come loose or escape until the bone is fully set; and afterward, restore the area with appropriate medicines.
But if there is a small swelling on the bone, then remove that swelling and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth protruding beyond the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural position, causing an irregular shape, especially in women, and particularly in young women, then you must consider: if a tooth is directly next to another tooth, and separation or a ligature is not possible, then remove that one; but if it is not adjacent to another tooth, then you cut into it using this instrument, which is shaped like a pig's snout, and is made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And your incision should be gradual, over several days, due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that it doesn't damage other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And it should be entirely made of Indian iron, and easily shaped; and it should have many tiny points, just like the file used to make needles, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then, finally, line it (the tooth) and extract it with some razors.
And if a tooth has a broken part that cuts the tongue, then you must file it until the sharpness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue is not injured and the speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver fillings.
When teeth are damaged by impact and displacement due to blows or bites, and the patient cannot firmly hold what is missing, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then, because of their lack of solidity, restore those that are missing with gold fillings, and not silver, because silver turns green and can become spoiled in a few days, but gold is never altered.
And the filling should be of such a thinness and thickness according to the amount needed to fit between the teeth; and the method for placing it is to take the filling and place twice its amount between two healthy teeth, and then shape it with two curves of the filling between the broken ones, or if there is only one or many, until the material reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the process until you reach the starting point, and hold it gently and carefully until it is firmly fixed.
And your grip, with which you hold the filling against the roots of the teeth, must not be excessive.
And then trim the excess filling with forceps or scissors, and precisely shape it in each location, and blend it in and hide it between the healthy tooth and the broken tooth, so that it doesn't cause injury to the tongue. And then leave it in that tight, firm state.
But if it is loose or broken, hold it or them with another filling in such a way throughout the entire time.
And this is the method for teeth and the manner of restoration of two healthy teeth and two broken teeth, just as you would see these bound together:
And when one or two teeth are returned to approximately their socket, and they are re-grown as we have described, and they remain.
And only skilled and wise artisans can do this.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is prepared, shaped like a tooth, and placed in the space where the tooth is missing, and is fastened as we said, and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the constriction of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which sometimes lies beneath the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a wound that has healed.
And the operation on it involves opening the patient's mouth, their head resting on your shoulder; lifting their tongue, and then carefully cutting the nerve ligament along its length, until the tongue is released from its constriction.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting there, resulting from a healed wound, then you apply a cautery iron and cut along its length until you have severed the ligament and the knot has been loosened.
And be careful not to make a cut into the flesh that will cause a deep wound and lead to excessive bleeding.
And then wash the incision site with vinegar or cold water; and then place a linen pad under the tongue; this is a compress that the patient will wear under their tongue every night so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding continues, then cauterize the area with a suitable, blunt cautery iron. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula under the tongue.
Sometimes, a boil resembling a small tumor develops under the tongue, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows significantly until it fills the mouth.
And the treatment involves opening the patient's mouth facing the sun and examining the abscess.
And if you see it of a dark color or black, hard, to which the patient feels no sensation, then do not touch that spot, for it is a cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place a lancet on it, and make a slight incision, and cut it from all sides; and if blood flows during your procedure, then place a crushed piece of alum (or vitriol) on top until the bleeding is stopped.
And then return to your work until you have removed it completely, until it has been washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses from both ears, and of those that are in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When an abscess develops in the throat, these are glands that are collected together, which break open and are called the tonsils;  and when you treat them with what we have described in the division and they are not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, with little sensation, then do not touch it with an iron.
And if it is reddish in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron for the flow of blood; but let it remain until it has matured, and then either you will drain it, or it will burst open by itself.
And if it is white, smooth, and its root is thin, then that is what needs to be incised.
And the operation for it is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested itself with complete rest or if it has lessened with any diminution; and then have the sick person sit facing the sun, and their head be on your lap, and open their mouth, and the attendant, placing their hands around it, presses down the patient's tongue from below with a very delicate instrument, of which this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be thin like a knife.
So, as you press with that on the tongue and the abscess is shown to you, and you apply your gaze upon it, then take a lancet and place it into the opening, and pull it out to the sides as far as you can. Furthermore, when you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this shape:
Furthermore, when you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this shape: and it is like forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is in line with the other, very sharp, which should be of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a scalpel, of which this is the shape: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other side.
And after you have incised one opening, cut the other following the same method of incision, and after the incision, the patient will recover from the cold.
However, if there is bleeding, stop it with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaf, or similar astringent substances, until the bleeding is controlled, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat or near the two ears, and incise them as I have described for the incision of two openings earlier.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat.  This abscess was dark-colored, insensitive, and had almost completely blocked her throat.  She was breathing with difficulty, and had been forbidden from eating or drinking, and she would have died if it had gone on for another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so large that two channels had formed before it finally burst through two openings.
Therefore, I incised it surgically and inserted a lancet into one of the openings, and pulled out a large amount.  Then I incised the area connecting to the other opening.  Then I opened her mouth, held her tongue down, and then inserted the lancet into the abscess.
And then I excised a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Thus, the woman's throat was completely cleared, and she immediately began to drink water, and then eat.  I continued to incise the abscess many times over a long period of time, and another abscess formed in the same location, which I incised again and again until it resolved.
Then I applied a cauterizing agent to her throat, which also helped; and afterward I left and did not know what God had done in that place near me.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision of a boil when it is suppurated.
When a sore throat affects the uvula, and it is suppurated and prolonged, it is then called a perpendicular sore; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a boil.
However, when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and you do not confirm your cure, and sometimes the boil has already been softened and is subtle, then you must incise that which is swollen and round; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and is not sensitive to touch, then you must try to incise it, for there is fear of the patient's condition in that.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, then you should have the patient sit down, and press the patient's tongue with an instrument, to observe its shape, and then place a probe on it, pull it down, and incise it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of two sores.
And it is necessary not to incise it except what is aligned to the natural border without addition, for if you incise it further, you will damage their speech.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of two sores, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you must use a cautery without fear, and the way to cauterize it is only with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head on your lap, then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and take the water we discussed in the chapter on cauterization, and with that, apply a live, not thick nor thin, cautery, and fill the cavity of the instrument of which the shape is [described].
Let the tip of the cavity where the medicine is placed be like the cavity of a leech cup.  Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and the patient lies on their side so that any saliva or mucus from the mouth flows due to the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it onto their throat and irritates it.
And then, apply your hand with the medicine and press it onto the uvula for half an hour until you see it blackened and softened by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the tip of the leech, and dip the cotton into the medicine.  Insert the leech with the cotton in a tube above it until the cotton adheres to the tube.  Repeat this as many times as necessary to achieve the desired effect on the uvula's cauterization, and then leave it to dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  Then, after the cauterization, clean the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and remove any traces of medicine. Wash with cold water, and apply an external remedy and internal healing until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incisions and less likely to cause fear.
Sometimes the uvula is cured by something more subtle than cauterization or incisions, through fumigation in this way: take balm, hyssop, oregano, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, marjoram and similar herbs, combine them all, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them with vinegar, and boil; and the pot should be tightly sealed with proper clay, and a hole should be made in the middle of the pot, over which an appropriate concave brass instrument is placed, made of silver or brass.
And the end of the instrument should be inserted into the patient's mouth, so the vapor rises to the uvula, through the tube, until the uvula is considerably dulled.
And repeat this several times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, for it would only worsen the abscess, and it is not appropriate to do so, unless advised by a qualified physician concerning the nature of the abscess.
However, if this instrument is not available, then take a reed and place a hard-boiled egg shell on its end, so the patient's mouth is protected, because the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the removal of thorns and things that adhere to the throat, and of other related issues.
Many times, a thorn or fishbone or some other object adheres to the throat.
Then it is necessary that you remove whatever of those is apparent, upon which you fix your gaze, pushing the tongue with an instrument in front of a light, so that what is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which is hidden and unseen in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food has digested in the stomach, for a cause closely attached to the throat will be forcibly expelled by vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of bread, or lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; or have the patient take a piece of dried sea sponge, tightly bound with wool, and then the patient swallows it, because when it reaches the spot where the thorns are, it is expelled. Or take an eel and drink it, tied with wool, and it is placed inside, and quickly removed; or take a leek and quickly place it and quickly remove it.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
And it should be larger than a fingernail, and at its end is a cavity which you can easily insert into the patient's throat.
And have the patient raise their head, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that it does not cause them pain, and with that, you push the bone or thorn, or the doctor pushes it with their hand.
But the patient himself should do it, if possible, because of his knowledge of the place of the cause and push it down, and pull his hand with the instrument up, all according to the amount that is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When the leech is treated with what we have described in the division of treatment with medicine and you don't get a response, then consider placing the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed the patient's tongue with the instrument we have described.
Therefore, if you see the leech, remove it with a small knife or with skillful, gentle gestures.
And if you cannot remove it with that, then take a concave tube and insert it into the patient's throat.  Then place a heated iron into the concavity of the tube, and do this repeatedly (until the leech is dead and comes loose from the throat).  And keep the patient away from water all day.
And then take a bowl full of cold water, open the patient's mouth into it, and rinse the mouth with it.  And let nothing be swallowed, and hold the water over the mouth for another hour with your hand, because as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.
But if it is not dislodged by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with frankincense or asafoetida, using the instrument we described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall off.
And another method of fumigation for it is that you take a bowl containing burning coals, and the bowl is covered with a lid that has a hole in it, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.  Then perform the fumigation above the patient.  Have the patient put their mouth on the end of the tube, and they should close their mouth to prevent the fumigation from escaping until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will fall off soon.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation several times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and let them eat salty things and other foods, and do not let them drink water; and thus it is necessary that through this treatment it will be dislodged.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is treated when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, but it has some curvature in one part. which is placed on the leech, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is smooth, on which a file is used so that, when grasping something, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discussion on abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are many types, of many kinds, according to their recollection, each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is according to the type of abscess itself; and by what we acquire from the humors.
And the second way is according to the location on the body where it occurs, for an abscess in the head is different from an abscess in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy area is different from an abscess in a joint; and each of them has its judgment regarding treatment.
And further, some abscesses should not be pierced until the pus has matured in them or has reached fullness.
Other abscesses should be lanced when they are inflamed and not yet fully matured, such as abscesses near joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its development extends until what is in its vicinity is corrupted, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are severely damaged, thus causing a contraction of that limb.  Or if the abscess is near a major limb, if you delay lancing it until it matures, it may harm the main limb.  Or if it's near the anus, then lance it while unripe.  Do not lance an unripe one near the anus because of incomplete digestion, lest you endanger the anal passage and cause the abscess to extend to the interior regions of the anus, leading to a fistula, or to a condition that will not heal. However, you must know the time to lance the abscess, and that is when it is mature.
And you know it is mature when the pain subsides and the fever ceases, and with the decrease in inflammation and throbbing, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and the other signs.
And therefore, you must make the incision in the most suppurative area beneath the abscess and from the discharge coming from the prominence.
And the incision should always be along the flesh or the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and away from the tendons, nerves, and arteries; and, in short, in all similar places where there is no reflection; for in those that are reflective, use incision according to that specific limb.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave the incision until the digestion of it is confirmed by improvement, as we have said; for if you incise it before this, you prolong the course of its pus and much filth, and make the edges of it hard and deep.
However, some abscesses are incised according to the width of the flesh or body, as necessity dictates, or according to the needs of the affected limb.
And it is necessary to make a small incision in small abscesses, and a large and wide incision, or several incisions, in large abscesses, according to the difference in size of the abscesses.
And others are of abscesses in which the pus must be hollowed out and cut, when done so that it can be fully drained, like those that occur in boils and buboes.
And some are incised with a three-angled cut; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like abscesses in the groin.
And some of them are treated with a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones.
But in those cases where there is no such need, like superficial lion-like abscesses, you should only make a superficial, or flat, incision.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should perforate it and not try to remove all the pus at once.  Having removed some, then close the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and repeat this many times according to stages until it is fully drained.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or a decrepit old person, for the animal spirit is often weakened by the discharge of pus, and the patient is easily killed, and you must be careful with the treatment.
Observe this chapter with great caution, and when making an incision to drain these abscesses, you must cleanse the wounds and then consider if the abscess wound is small, or a simple flat incision, then apply a bandage of linen or old cloth.  If the abscess is large and the incision has many openings, you must place a medicament in each opening until they come together.
And if a portion of the skin has been incised or peeled away around the abscess, then you must fill it with old cloth or linen strips, like when you would dress a wound from a loaf or root, without moisture; and hold it in place for up to three days. Then, continue to treat and heal it with suitable ointments until it is completely healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar in which you have soaked a linen cloth, and place this over the bleeding area repeatedly.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer a regimen and treatment, and use the powders that are described in many places in this book and in different sections.
However, if it is wintertime and the abscess is located in a region with many nerves, you must mix powders with warm wine and oil, and apply them to the affected area.
And if it is summer, and the affected areas are fleshy, then you must apply powders mixed with cool water and oil, or with wine and oil, and keep it cool until the third day, as we have stated.  Then, you must lance the abscess, clean it, and provide the appropriate treatment until healed.
And this is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general; however, according to the method of distinction that I have already described, each type of abscess has a different method of treatment, which will be described separately in chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the lancing of abscesses that appear on the scalp.
Small abscesses form on the scalp, often as lumps (nodules) containing membranes that surround them; and these lumps contain pus.
And they contain pus, and that pus contains moisture similar to lime. And some contain moisture similar to dust, and others are like that; and some are stony, hard.
And in lancing them all, and in their removal, there is no fear, as their removal does not cause counteracting reactions.
And the procedure for lancing them is that you probe them with an instrument shaped somewhat like this, which is called a lancet, until you know what they contain.
If what it contains is moisture, then you divide that with a lancing motion along the length, by a superficial incision in this manner:
And begin the incision from the line of B to the line of G.  Then, as the moisture is evacuated, you scrape away the skin that contained the moisture, and do not leave any remnant, for it often returns if any remains.
Then soak cotton in Egyptian unguent, if present, or else in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, for by this you corrode any remaining skin film.
And then repeat applying the Egyptian unguent to the cotton a second and third time, if needed, until you are certain that no part of the skin film remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you should cut it in this manner: with an incision in the shape of a cross, and insert probes between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from all sides, and exert your strength in removing the membrane that contains it.
But if your efforts encounter resistance, then do what I told you first.
And similarly, do the incision and treatment of the calcified abscess as we have told you; and an incision on a calcified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that appear on the head of some men, which are not entirely moist; this is why I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if one were to strike it, it would hurt.
But in other abscesses on the head, this is not applicable, like abscesses that appear on the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, but the incision on all of these should be superficial.
And make the perforation of those from the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus to the lower parts.
And then treat them with what is appropriate for their treatment.
Chapter 42.
Concerning the incision of scrofulas that occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck and armpits and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that appear on the neck, and many are generated within them, and every scrofula of those is within its own membrane, and similarly as with the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant, which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that one which you find to be well-disposed upon touching, whose visible color is similar to that of a carbuncle, and is softened on all sides, and is not attached to the neck's nerves, veins, or arteries, and is not deep-seated, you should make a superficial incision, from the upper part to the lower part of the body, following a line from G to B, and drain it on all sides, and separate the carbuncle's edges with forceps, or many forceps if necessary, as we described for head abscesses, and extract it bit by bit.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And if the inflammation is not very sharp, do not injure the patient by your incision, or disturb the sick person, and cut only what is necessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and are hindered by your operation, then apply powdered vitriol or other powders that stop blood flow, and constrict the sore, and leave it until the inflammation subsides and the sore is softened and begins to become putrid. When the blood is drawn/separated/removed.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And now, using your index finger, check for any other small scrofulous causes, then cut and clean them.
And if a large vein is at the root of the scrofulous swelling, then you should not cut that swelling at its roots. Before that, you should tie that with a tightly folded cloth and let it remain until it falls away on its own without harm.
And then fill the wound with old wool, which you have previously soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it accordingly.
And if you cut the entire swelling, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch it as soon as there is no excess fluid remaining.
But if you see that there is excess fluid due to the size of the swelling, you should proceed to cut the root of that, draw it out, and administer the suture and other treatments as previously described.
And those swellings containing moisture, pierce them with a superficial incision at the location of their maturation, and place the incision so that it draws the pus down the body, as we have said.
And then administer a poultice, some ointment, or similar remedies, so that it corrodes any remaining corruption. And when you see the wound is clean, then you treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the boil or abscess on the neck.
The ancients wrote about this incision of the boil, and no one in our land has seen it done.
And this is the description of what they said.
However, in people with a spine problem, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, because it will not help, since all the veins and arteries of the patient are located there.
However, in those with hot abscesses in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the head, one should use the incision of the boil to avoid the loss caused by cauterization.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should cut into the boil below three or four circles of the boil's circles, using a small incision between two circles, and the incision should be made on the boil's core, not on the cartilage, and this place is suitable for the incision because it is free of flesh and the blood vessels there are far away.
And if the physician is cautious, then he should widen the throat's membrane with a probe and then slice through the membrane until it reaches the channel, but should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
And then cut the core, as we have described; and the incision of the channel is signaled by the pus which is expelled with what is broken off, and by the cessation of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
So, once the time for the perforation is past, bring together the two edges of the wound's membrane and stitch them together without including the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the procedure we have described is not complete until you see that some of these abscesses have already closed the patient's throat, and the patient has been brought to the brink of death, and the patient's breathing is cut off, and some people cut the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the wound for some breathing, and thus be saved from death.
And because of this, I command that the wound be left open until the illness's virulence is consumed; and its virulence lasts for three days; and then, I command to stitch the wound and to treat it until it is healed.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and placed it in her throat and cut a portion of the windpipe (the trachea), and I was called to treat her, and I found her breathing in the way someone does when dying, and I discovered the wound and found the blood that had come from the wound to be small.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was escaping from the wound, and I treated her until she was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant unless it was related to her voice, and after a few days, her conditions improved.
And now I say that in the section on epilepsy, there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the incision on an abscess occurring outside the throat, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no remedy.
And the accidental case is in two ways, one being similar to greasy lumps, and the other way similar to an abscess formed by the blockage of an artery, and in that case, there is fear (of complications). And it is not appropriate to apply a cautery to it (the abscess) with iron, except in the case of a small one. And you should try it and investigate it with the probe, and if you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it like tumors, and extract what contains it from the skin and pouch; but if not, then the whole nature of it should be explored, and then treat the area with the necessary cure until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already mentioned all the types of them in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount here the difference between a tumor and an abscess, in case of doubt.
Therefore, I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed; and when the putrefaction is complete, the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a tumor there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it has that specific lion-like appearance that is in the proper sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a blister and is made thus, like a swelling, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for either they are fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of moisture are many, as I mentioned in the division.
Therefore, when arriving at the treatment of a tumor, you should probe and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument called a probe, as its form will be shown in the chapter that is near this one.
And it is a method of inquiry into abscesses and all tumors, which is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid area you find within the abscess, and you will revolve your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the membrane.
And then, place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the probe and consider what has come out on its residue.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color it is, has been expelled, then you incise it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture from the probe's residue, then know that it is fatty (or, perhaps, "greasy").
And dry it with an incision shaped like a cross, following this shape: In the manner I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin completely easily, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it, and draw out that pus with the forceps.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and it often happens this way, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if any part, little or much, remains, the forceps will return to the wound.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders and tightly close the wound, and place a warm poultice over that which was an abscess, and treat it with the other cures until it is healed.
And if it is a large wound, then you stitch the two edges together and treat it with whatever promotes healing.
But if there is a pulsating artery there, or if it is not pulsating, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed verdigris (copper sulfate) and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound can be closed and the blood's inflammation subsides; and then return to dissecting any remaining parts of the wound.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for surgery and perforation.
Of those, the forms of the instruments, are of three types, some are large, some are medium-sized, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, or bronze, with sharpened edges, so that they readily penetrate abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and are called probes, and one of them is called a lancet.
And it is of three types, for one of them is large, medium-sized, and small.
The form of the large instrument, its shape:
The form of the medium-sized instrument, its shape:
The form of the small instrument, its shape:
It is suitable for those abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, and buboes, because within them are bones and other things.
And make them round, thick, sharp, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of citrus wood, or of horn, or of iron, or of silver.  The best are those made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which is believed to be suitable for opening fistulas, where there are reflexions [or reflections] within their cavities,  and that they can be reflected by their lightness with those reflexions.
And there are three varieties, for some are long, some are medium, and others short, according to the size of the fistula and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some are simple, having only one curve, and these are of three kinds: large, small, and medium.
And of them are hooks without gold, and these are of three types.
And of those are hooks having two curves, and these are of three types.
And of them are those having three curves, and these are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium-sized hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium-sized hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and cauterized, and they are of three types, namely large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium-sized scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are blunt, and they are not placed in such a way as to cause injury during the cauterization of the nodes; this is to avoid cutting a vein or nerve, and through this, the patient is healed and finds a little peace due to the cauterization which is applied near the incision of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of lancets, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and are similar to a ray, with which alcohol is applied.
And it has a pointed tip hidden by a sheath, and in it run channels both inside and outside, as you wish, just as you see.
The shapes of lancets, which are hidden among the fingers near the perforation of abscesses and are not perceived by the patients, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is drawn, are of three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and are thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be present, so that through them the flow of blood can be drawn quickly when necessary, and then, when initially, it is not medicine.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only on fleshy areas, such as the calf of the legs and thighs, the forearm and breast, the abdomen and knees, and similar fleshy and moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments like the skins of bladders are made in this form, through which blood is drawn when performed by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of male breasts that resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep, as they begin to grow hair, and the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and become inflamed, becoming sore.
And whoever sees this, should incise those with a lunar incision, following this shape, from line B to line G, then scrape away all the swelling, and then fill the wound with a flesh-healing medicine, and then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the nipple descends and is softened by its size, like those of women, then it should be split into two parts slightly higher, with two lunar-shaped incisions, each contained within the other towards the end of each, until the larger line contains the smaller one, following this pattern from line B to line G. Then scrape away the thick tissue between the two edges of the wound, removing the excess fat, and administer the suture and powders mentioned earlier, as necessary for the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision needed because of the patient's distress or bleeding, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive unguent, leaving it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the lancing of abscesses that arise below the eyelid.
These abscesses that arise below the eyelid are a type of scrofulous, hard swelling, which contains a pouch-like skin.
And some of these contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, following this figure: from line G to line B.  And when all the pus in the abscess has been drained, then you should fill it with old cloth and leave it until the following day.
And then the cloth should be removed and treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type found in nodes and scrofulous swellings, then you should make an incision upon it as we have described in the section on scrofulous swellings as well.
If the ulcer has spread so that it might break open, then administer cautery to it as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur due to archery or vein injuries.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the overlying swelling has become consolidated, abscesses often occur.  And the signs by which one recognizes that inflammation and abscess are caused by an artery or vein are:  when the abscess is caused by an arrow wound, it is often located superficially on the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a hissing sound.
And the one caused by a vein is round and evident on the body's surface.
And incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in those located under the armpits, and in the elbows, and neck, and in many other parts of the body; and if it is large, its surgical treatment must be avoided.  And those in the extremities, or on the head, must be avoided.
But on those that originate from inflammation of the arrow wound's opening, make a longitudinal incision in the swelling; then open the incision with hooks and extract the arrow, and free it from the tissues until it is uncovered.
Then place a needle over the wound and push it through to the other side, and secure the arrow with a double thread in two places—a technique I, your teacher, taught you in the extraction of two arrows that are in the temples.
And then puncture the area between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood is drawn out, and the abscess is resolved.
And then administer treatment in the affected area to produce pus until the ligaments subside; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as possible with a bandage, then insert the needle below the area you've held with your hand and pierce through; and tie it with a double thread until you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a strong bandage, as I have taught you about the grape-like bandage in two parts with two ends of thread.
But if you fear pulling out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle below the entire abscess, beneath the first puncture, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle until what is within it has come out; then you cut away the excess of the bandage and leave what is tied to it.
Then place a poultice, soaked in wine and oil, on it, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess resulting from nerve torsion.
Thus, as abscesses occur in the arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured by impact or excessive exertion, and by similar causes.
And it is most frequent in the areas of the helpers (or ankles) or in any place where the joints are inflamed.
And it is a serious abscess, and it is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in the majority of cases without clear signs, and when it is constricted with violence, the patient experiences a similar sensation of numbness.
And it is not an abscess that spreads throughout the body, and therefore remains below the skin, and it is inflamed in all directions and does not spread to the front or back parts of the body.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be treated with iron, for it will easily cause a contraction.
But that which is on the head or forehead should be treated with a poultice underneath the skin. But if it is a small abscess, then use the forceps and cut it out at its root.
And if it is large, then you should suspend it with hooks, and scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess that arises from a boil that arises in the belly.
Many times, these boils appear in the bellies of some people and other parts of their bodies.  These boils are called "fungal" because of their resemblance to fungi, whose roots are fine and whose heads are large; and the edges of these boils are often turned inwards, and some are small, while others are very large and prominent.
And I have seen one where two boils were in his belly, resembling fungi, and there was no difference between them; they were white, with fine roots.
And their edges were turned inward and split open, and moisture constantly flowed from it.
Therefore, I incised them and found one to be eighteen ounces in weight and the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider whether the patient is humid, and if the boil's color is white, moist, and with fine roots; then you should incise it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries present in the fire, for often much blood is expelled during the incision; and if you see blood, cauterize the area.
And if the patient is fearful and timid, beware of incisions with iron; but then take fresh lead plaster and apply it to the boil, in the manner we have described, and leave it on for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead plaster; therefore, do not cease tightening the lead plaster on the boil until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the boil has thick roots, then its incision causes some fear and apprehension, especially in one that is on the abdomen.
However, it is possible that you incise half of it and then cauterize that area so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to cut a boil that is dark-colored, insensitive, and with little regard, for that one is possibly cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer close by.
Chapter 52.
Of the treatment of a protrusion of the navel.
A protrusion of the navel is caused by various things; either by fissures in the skin covering the abdomen, and this is similar to the tearing or intestines that occur in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as already mentioned; or by trapped wind in the area.
However, if it is due to a fissure in the skin and the consequent protrusion of the tissue, then the color of the abscess will be similar to the color of the body; and it is painless, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then the location of this differs significantly from what we have described; when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden and then returns; and it is painful, and significantly more difficult near the groin and causes significant suffering.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is painless and does not recede when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it thought to be serious.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess will exhibit the signs of a darkening, leaning towards black.
But if it is due to putrefied flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, and hard, and it is situated in a certain quantity.
But if it is due to wind/gas, then the touch of it is painless.
And the operation for it is to consider whether the swelling at the navel is from blood of an arrow wound, or of a vein, or due to wind/gas. Then you should be forbidden from treating it, for in such cases there is fear and dread, just as was taught in the chapter where I discussed abscesses from arrow wounds and vein wounds.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestine or to the membrane, then you must command the patient to hold his breath and be standing upright.  Then probe the area around the entire navel, and direct him to lean over between your hands on his elbows. Then, circle the area around the navel with a wide spatula on the area you marked with the probe. Next, use a large incision to open the abscess on its upper side, and then tie it up in a circular fashion with strong thread or flax in a suitable manner.
Then, open the middle of the expanded abscess on the ligament, and insert your finger into that opening and search for the intestine. If you have found it and it is held by the ligament, then you should carefully remove the hold and push the intestine back to the inside of the abdomen.
And if you have found the membrane, then take it with an incision; and cut away the excess of it.
But if it is contrary to an arrow wound or a vein, then circle that area and return to your procedure; and take two needles and put strong thread in them, and insert the two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, and make them penetrate. Then, compress the abscess into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the expanded flesh can soften and fall away on its own; or cut it when it has softened and is ready, and then treat it with the appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the swelling of the navel is of flesh that has grown there or due to moisture, then it is necessary to open the abscess as we have said and drain the blood or moisture you find there, and then treat it with what is appropriate and that consolidates the area.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already said, in the division, about the types of cancer and how it can be treated with medicines, and that avoiding treatment with iron is important because it prevents it from becoming ulcerated; and we have discussed cancer originating in the breast and the precautions for treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a location where its removal is possible, like cancer on the breasts or the thighs, and similar locations on the limbs, removing all of it, especially when it is small and newly formed.
However, when it is old and severe, one should not attempt its removal, for I have neither been able to cure it nor have I seen anyone else do so, nor is it known to have been accomplished.
And the operation for it, when it is located as we have said, is that you should first let the patient rest and purge them of black bile on occasion, and then bleed them if there is an obvious accumulation of blood.
And then prepare the patient with preparations appropriate to the location of the operation, and then insert hooks into the wound that fit that location; and then, using a sharp-edged instrument (like a cautery or a surgical knife - the word 'codena' is ambiguous in this context) , excavate thoroughly around it until no remnants of the root causes are left. And allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it quickly, and express the areas, and wipe away the clotted blood with your hand or instrument that is appropriate to you of the tools available.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood through cutting a vein or artery, then cauterize the area until the flow of blood stops, and then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 154.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy due to water, and the signs of each type, along with the treatment of it using medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of dropsy of the 'alhitas' alone, and it is not treated with iron in the case of the type of 'timpanists' or the type of 'yposarcha', for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanist dropsy with medicines, and your treatment does not prove effective, then consider this: if the patient is already weakened, or has another illness, or another type of dropsy, such as in the lungs or belly, and similar to those, then be careful not to treat it with iron, for there is danger in doing so.
However, if you observe the patient with exuberant strength, and there is no other illness besides dropsy alone, and the patient is neither a child nor an old person, then the method of treatment is to raise the patient with your hands, and the attendant should press the patient's abdomen with his hand, pushing the water towards the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a spinos spatula in this manner:
It should be two parts sharp, long, with a sharp tip like a spatula; however, there should be some small shortness in its length, so that in the procedure you do not enter the intestine and damage it.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for then you must, using your incision, move away from the navel by about three fingers towards the lower parts, to the right of it, above the abdomen.
However, if the dropsy originates from a liver ailment, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be to the right.
And your incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that the excess fluids are not driven to that constricted area.
And then pierce with the instrument through the entire membrane, and then insert into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the skin, and scrape away that; and if it's the quantity of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then pierce the skin until the spatula reaches the empty space, and is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: And it resembles a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is cut in the shape of a feather, like this:
And at its uppermost end is a small ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately falls onto the instrument, thus evacuating a moderate amount of water; for if you evacuate more than necessary at a time, the patient will die quickly through resolution of their animal spirit, or you will cause the approach of death.
But evacuate it according to the quantity indicated by its virtue, and according to what the patient's condition, the strength of their pulse, and their constitution suggest to you.
And then remove the instrument, and retain the water, because it is immediately held by the cord that holds the hole that is above the sac, of which I have told you to pierce it in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure the following day, if the patient tolerates it, and withdraw a small quantity of water, and do this for several days with caution, and beware of error until only a little water remains.
However, if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of water, then cure that with burial in hot sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying remedies until it is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver after the water extraction, as I have described previously.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children born with non-perforated urinary passages.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is too narrow, or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to pierce it soon after birth with a very thin instrument, using this method:
And then place a thin lead peg in the opening, and bind it, and keep it in place for three days or four.
And when it wishes to urinate, it will be relieved and urinate; and then return it to its place.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine passing over the area will not allow this opening to close.
But that whose opening is narrow should be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in which the opening is not in its place, as said, which causes difficulty for them, that is, the opening is near the end of the penis tip, so they cannot urinate properly,  until you raise the penis with your hand to its proper position;  and it is not a generative issue, because the semen cannot reach the female according to the correct position, and is a very slow-developing illness.
And the method of the operation on him is that the patient is placed on their back, and then gently pull the head of the penis with your left hand, and carefully cut the head of the foreskin from the place of the prepuce with a sharp instrument, like a feather, or you remove any part of it, so that the opening of the penis returns to its natural place and the opening falls into the correct position as is required.
And be careful in your operation of blood flow, for many times this happens; and stop it with whatever you use to cut the blood, and heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the whitlow that occurs on the foreskin around the head of the penis, and its corruption, blackness, and adhesion to the head of the penis.
This whitlow often occurs on the penis, and it is a protruding, inflamed flesh.
And of those, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine thread and cut it back so that it is all gone; then place a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment over it; and thereafter treat it with diachronic ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a dark color, then you must apply cautery near its incision and its base.
But if the whitlow is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the whitlow is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you must remove the part of the whitlow inside first until it is healed; and then you treat the part outside, because when you treat both at the same time and the foreskin, there is no guarantee that it won't be broken/torn.
And if you see dark discoloration and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you must remove everything already blackened and about to rot or that has already rotted; and then apply a poultice made of honey mixed with ground pomegranate rind and crushed and sieved herbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
For a helpful cautery is useful in two situations at once, that is, for a flow of blood and for a plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed at once, then you must insert a lead cannula into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to plague or abscess), you must scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then you must scrape with a spatula some matter from the head of the penis and foreskin, because the foreskin, when thin, is easily pierced due to its thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
And then treat with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
Chapter 57.
Of the purification of children and the treatment of what happens to them during circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is our operation and our will, and its purpose is specifically in children, it is necessary to assign to it the best operation and easiest way to achieve health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws.  It is only after our experience that we have found most craftsmen and barbers using circumcision and purification with a razor and with cauteries; and they use ligatures with thread and incisions with the fingernail.
And I have already tested all these methods and find no better purification with scissors, with thread ligatures than with fingernail purification, because often the foreskin is pulled too far back, for the foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer remains, and a further incision is easily forced causing unnecessary pain and risk. And with the purification done by applying a tool, and it is digital, used by shoemakers, the incision of the tip of the male organ is not secure, because easily the tool can enter the opening.
But in the operation with a fingernail, it is easy to damage the skin and spoil the procedure. And the foreskin of the child is naturally short, and many times it is born in such a manner that it does not require purification, and I have seen this.
However, the purification done with scissors and thread ligatures, the goodness, experience shows me, for the scissors are for a proportional incision, because the sharpness on top is as sharp as the sharpness on the bottom; and therefore, when you press your hand, both sharpness are proportional, and they are cut in a way that is proportionate and is accomplished at once; and the tightness of the thread, shaping to contain the foreskin of the penis in every way, creates a sure way to prevent any errors.
And the first way of the operation is that you make the child lie down, especially if it's one that understands a little, and you simply tie the thread to its penis and leave it until the next day.
And then make him/her happy in any way that is possible, given his/her ability to understand. And then have him/her lie still and be prepared, and let there be no movement; and conceal the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child does not see them or any other instrument.
And then place your hand on his/her penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the tip of the penis is visible, and then clean it of any adhering dirt.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt, and the other sharp, so that the nail's head is not cut off, and the length of both blades should be the same as the length of two handles.
But the mistake in cleaning is that too easily you remove the entire foreskin, or a part of it, from around the incision.
Therefore, you should stretch that with your finger before the abscessing of the area and cut it according to equal parts.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then remove it with a forceps and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and that which is swollen below the penis remains abscessed, then you leave it until the hot abscess has subsided, and gently scrape that, and cut it according to your preparation.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not be good for him.
And therefore cure that with what consolidates wounds from the powders which we have recounted in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut from the vein to excess, and you injure the surrounding parts, that will not be good for him.
And further, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction, either by stone or congealed blood, or by pus or flesh, and similar to those mentioned in the methods of treatment in the section/division.
And if the urine is not released by the methods mentioned previously, and the cause is severe, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the form: It should be made of silver and be a subtly curved cone, like a bird's quill, with a slender, long, pointed tip, similar to a palm and a half, to which a thin tube is attached to its head.
And the method of extracting the urine with this is that you should take a doubled sheet of linen or cotton and tie it to the end; insert the ends of the linen into the area below the syringe; and cut away any excess linen with scissors, but insert it firmly into the tube with force.  Then lubricate the syringe with oil and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and lubricate the bladder and the penis with soft oils, olive oil, and water.
And then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the base of the penis; then pull the penis up towards the navel; then push the syringe into that area; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder, and this will show that the patient's cause is empty, and this is not done in this order, but in a meandering manner.
And then slowly pull out the linen with the cotton, little by little, for the urine will saturate the linen.
Now extract it and use the urine for treatment, and use the syringe, do not stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 99.
On the quality of bladder irrigation using a clamp and similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulceration or abscess in the bladder, or congealed blood within, or a narrowing of the urethra, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form:
but rather, at its end, it is closed, i.e. sealed. And in that, there are three openings: two on one side, just like times.
At the beginning, there is a concave space, in which is that which is pushed, and it should be in proportion to the amount that fills it, without addition, until when some cause is pulling from the humidities, it is pulled, and when it is expelled, with that is pulled, and when it is expelled far, according to the manner of a clamp with which naphtha is applied in naval battles.
Therefore, if you wish to introduce humidity into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the humidity, and pull with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clamp.
And then, insert the end of the clamp into the penis, as we have recounted in the treatise; and then push the humidity with that which you push, for that humidity will reach the bladder quickly, and the patient will recover.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is treated, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the highest part resembles a small feather, and below it a tube is enclosed within it.
And then take a bladder, and place in it the humidity you want to treat in the bladder, and then tie it between two things with a strong double-string bandage, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And then insert the end of the instrument into the penis.
And then press your hand on the bladder with the humidity with a descending pressure until the patient feels that the humidity has reached the bladder.
However, if you do not have a bladder, then you take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and pierce it all over its roundness; and then insert strong cords into those holes, as if they were twisted; and then attach the circle as if it were attached to a stand, and put in it whatever humidities, oils, and waters you want.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones, their treatment with medicines, the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed stones in which manual operation and incision are needed.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly the one that is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children; and among their signs is that the urine expelled from the bladder is like water in its fineness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs their genitals, frequently bends over, and is often straightened up; and with this, they defecate frequently.
And the cure for children is easier before they turn fourteen years old; and the cure is difficult in the elderly. But in young people, it is easier because it is within them.
And the larger the stone, the easier the cure; and if it is small, the opposite is true.
Therefore, to arrive at the cure for this, it is necessary at the beginning to cleanse the patient with clysters, which remove all the inflammation in their bowels; for this inflammation sometimes hinders the stone's expulsion from the body.
And then the patient should be lifted by their feet and shaken and beaten gently underneath so that the stone descends to the bladder's area, or jumps out of its position.
And then, place that bladder stone, prepared between your hands, and the patient's hands beneath their thighs so that the entire bladder is drawn downwards.
And then, extract it and everything from the outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you should immediately apply a cutting action on it.
And if it doesn't fully descend with your touch, then you should anoint your left index finger (if the patient is a child), or middle finger (if they are a grown-up) with oil, and insert it into their anus. And extract the stone until it is beneath your finger. And move it little by little until it reaches the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it out of the area from which you extracted it.
And tell the attendant to press on the bladder with their hand; and tell another attendant to use their right hand to pull the genitals upward, and their left hand to hold down the pubic area, near the site of the incision.
And then carefully insert a spatula, the shape of which is as follows: And cut through the tissue between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but along the side of the left thigh; and let the incision be on that stone, and your finger be inside the anus, and make a transverse incision so that the incision outside is wide and inside narrow, according to the amount of the stone's protrusion that is possible, and not more, for if you forcefully press your finger in the anus, the stone near the incision will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that there is a certain angle or margins to the stone, which makes its extraction difficult because of that.
And that which is of that nature, resembling a testicle, is round, and is easily extracted.
Therefore, if it is one with angles and margins, it is wedged in the fissure.
And if it is not easily expelled, then you should gently press on it, or grasp it with a suitable instrument, whose tip is like a file with which you press on the stone, and do not injure it; or you should insert underneath it a delicate curved instrument.
But if you cannot remove it, then you should enlarge the opening a little, and if you see blood flowing, cut it firmly with crushed vitriol.
But if the stones are more than one, then first you press your hand against the opening of the bladder, and then cut into it; then press a little further; and do similarly if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is foolish for you to cut it with a large incision, for you cause the patient one of two things: either death or a continuous dribbling of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer expulsion of it until it is expelled, or apply force to its fracture with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in heated oil and cold water, so that a feverish abscess may be calmed.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have loosened it, apply water and oil to the area, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a feverish, burning, and corrosive abscess arises, and it is similar to if the blood is frozen in the bladder, and because of it, urination is prohibited (and this is known by the blood coming out with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it causes the bladder to rot and consequently putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with sour wine, water and salt, and with any other suitable remedy for the healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all the treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the remedies that are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, and is lodged there, and urination is also prohibited, then treat it with what I have recommended before, rather than resorting to surgery, for many times this treatment has been accused of needing surgery; and I have already tested this, and it is for you to take a sharpened iron drill, of which this is the shape of it:
with a triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take a bandage, and tie the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing easily until the drill reaches that stone. And turn the drill with your hand against that small stone little by little, and you widen the hole until you make the other part penetrate; for then the urine is immediately released.
And then press your hand on what is remaining of the stone from the exterior part of the penis, for that is broken, and it is pushed out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for any reason that prevents it, then tie a bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then you apply heat to the stone on that penis between the two bandages. And then remove that (stone/object). And then loosen the bandage and clean the congealed blood, which has formed in the wound.
And a bandage below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other bandage on top is only for that reason. For when the bandage below the stone is removed, the stone returns to its place and heals the wound.
And therefore, when you tie the bandage above, you must lift the stone to the upper parts, or it will return to its original position, and it will heal the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
However, if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited by many methods.
One of them is because the woman is very young and a virgin.
And the second is that you don't find a woman knowledgeable enough to reveal herself to the doctor when she is chaste, or is one of the married women.
The third is that you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision, over a stone in women, is far from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and in that is fear.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a knowledgeable female physician, and few are found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skillful and subtle male doctor, or present a matron well-versed in the treatment of women, or a woman who has specialized knowledge in this art.
Therefore, present her, and instruct her to do everything you command her, from the examination of the stone at the beginning; this is to ascertain if the woman is a virgin, then it is necessary that she place her finger into her anus and seek the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it,  she must grasp it under her finger, and then instruct her to make an incision over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and pressing it firmly.
Therefore, if it is found, then it is necessary to gradually draw it from the bladder opening to the lower parts, with the strength of her virtue, until it reaches the root of the thigh.
And then make an incision over that portion of the vagina near the root of the thigh where it is positioned, and extract the stone from that area, and keep her finger pressing against the stone.
And the incision should be small at first; then insert the instrument over that incision, and if you feel the stone, then deepen the incision according to the size needed to remove the stone.
And know that there are many kinds of stones: some are small and large, some are jagged and rough, some long and round, and some with projections.
Therefore, you know how many types there are, so that you can specify what you want.
And if you see blood flowing, apply powdered vitriol to the area and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then resume your operation until the stone is removed.
And prepare the instruments needed for removing stones in men, so that you may be aided in your operation.
And if you see blood flowing, and know that the blood is coming from the cut artery, then apply powder to the area and compress it with bandages and a tight dressing, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will likely die easily. And then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area has healed, then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which is below the pubic bone containing the testicles, and is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper covering that nature prepared in the area of the testicle, until it is clear that there is another testicle; and the pubic bone is between the white sac we mentioned, and this is nothing but a delay.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that affects the testicles, so that this matter is discharged into them, and sometimes it is caused by a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has various colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black, or whitish, watery, and that is what is most common.
And the signs by which one knows where this accumulation of water is are these: if it is in the white sac we mentioned, then the abscess is round, slightly elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle appears to be partially covered by the moisture on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper covering, then the abscess is round, with a part of the testicle, and for this reason one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the scrotum and the white sac, then it is felt below the testicle.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the abscess with a small, sharp instrument, the shape of which has been previously specified; and according to what appears on the residue of the instrument, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary to order the patient to be bled, if possible, and to see if the body is full.
And then lie him on his back on something slightly elevated, and place soft cloths beneath him.
And then sit you on his left side, and command the assistant to sit on his right, who should place their hand on one of two sides on the scrotum and the abdominal groin area.
And then take a sharp knife and cut the scrotum in the middle lengthwise, up to almost the groin.
And the incision should be made, following a straight line equally distant from the line of the scrotal skin, until it reaches the white fibrous tissue.
And scrape that away, and observe, and be careful not to cut into that; and your scraping, with which you scrape that part, should be delicate and carefully done, scraping according to the quantity possible for you.
And then pierce the water-filled sac with a wide opening, and remove all the water.
And then separate the two edges of the incision with forceps, and spread the sac outward; and do not touch the scrotal skin/tissue, but cut the sac in a way that is possible for you. And cut it [the sac] completely or in pieces, and especially its fine/thin side, for if you do not carefully examine the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the egg [hernia sac] comes out of its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sac, return it inside, and then rejoin the two edges of the scrotal skin/tissue with stitches, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the egg [hernia sac] corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are above the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two distinct areas, for example, then understand that there are two hernias; therefore, cut that area as you did the other one; and if it appears to you that it is a single operation, then you should do it.
And then you clean the blood, and place in the incisions wool soaked in oil or rubbed oil; and place another piece of wool soaked in wine and oil outside, and spread that over the scrotum and the area of the belly; and place over folded cloths and powders, and bind them together with a bandage that is in this manner/form:
And then two cloths are taken and filled with  medicated wool according to this resemblance; and their extremities are made with cotton or damp wool, and attached with a bandage to the breeches/undergarment, and one extremity is pulled from the buttocks to the groin, and the second extremity is pulled towards the thigh, and two extremities on the thighs below, and two other extremities above the groin/knees, and the entire bandage is secured around the undergarment.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of cutting with iron; and you should take a sharp knife-cautery and cut the skin of the genitals with it, and heat it as we have described until the white pouch containing the fluid is exposed, and then you take a cautery in this form: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce that pouch, and heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then pull the pouch open with hooks, and scrape it with heated, sharp cautery; and cut it as much as possible until you have removed everything; and be careful that the egg [testicle] does not get burned.
And know that this procedure is safer and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with a cut.
However, if you encounter a suppurating boil during the process of incision or cauterization, or blood flow, then you must treat whatever problem arises, using a treatment appropriate for the situation as described.
However, if the patient is frail and does not tolerate a second operation because of its unpleasantness, then perform the perforation as I have recommended; and it is when you are certain, from what we have said about the significations, that the hernia is acute.
Then you must place the patient on a slightly raised surface, and then pierce the abscess in the lowest part of the body with a wide spatula, and position the opening in line with the body's length.
And keep the opening wide until all the water drains out.
And then apply a cloth to the area, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
However, if there is resistance to the water draining, at that time you pierce it: and this is done because the white membrane in the wound's opening creates resistance and prevents the water from exiting, then you must place into the wound a tool or instrument with which water is extracted from hydrops, the form of which is previously described; or apply a small compress to the wound's pressure point.
And know that the water returns, and is collected again approximately six months or around that time; and when it is collected, then it must be pierced according to the same method, for the illness will thus pass its days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision on this hernia there is fear of causing harm in the majority of cases; therefore, I have seen the dismissal of it and the patient being saved by this better method.
And I am recalling the operation on that and the kinds of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the parts of which the tissues are composed, and this is caused by many things: either by a sharp, harmful excess, which is discharged into the tissues, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and pain is not found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And a very serious abscess is the petrified one, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by the knotting of the arteries, and by the inflammation of those, just as it is perceived in the memory, or by the inflammation of the veins.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and it is not appropriate that you touch it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the vein is not dispersed by any means from it due to pressing with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this type [of abscess] a section be made, and on the other flesh; and that you incise the skin around the genitals, and then spread the testicle towards the upper parts, and extract it from the white sac, and free the supporting vessels, and tie them, and cut the supporting tissue more thoroughly than you free it from all parts around the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already in those hardened tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and cut it open.
And if there is adhesion between anything in the sac, or between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut all of that away, and extract the testicle just as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in heated oil and wine; and then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of a hernia that is of the groin.
The groin is an abscess surrounded by some sort of swelling similar to a boil, accompanied by softening of the testicles.  This makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, fear is overcome by the remembrance of that which preceded it.
However, it is necessary to describe the operation in the same way that the first [operations] were done.
And I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on a raised surface; then, gently pull the supporting structures of the testicles downward; then, grasp the base of the genitals with your fingers, using instruments that are reliable for the penis; another assistant should hold these, and extend them vigorously.
Then, with a sharp, broad scalpel, make a transverse incision along the side of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then, scrape away everything, just as we described in the extraction of arrows that are in the temples.
And then place a needle with a double point into those [incisions], and tie it to the first of the places where you cut, then tie it again to the back of them. And then cut them [the affected areas] in the middle, along a straight line following the length of the body, and remove what is accumulated of the foul and corrupted moisture.
And then treat the wound with the remedies for other wounds where you want pus to be generated, so that the vessels that feed one of the two veins might rupture, for it is not harmful.
However, if you cut all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be blocked by the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the cutting of the vessels, and that they are hardened, or that they are blocked so that there is no improvement with them.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture in the stretched diaphragm above the abdomen, on the side of the abdominal muscles, causing the intestines from that rupture to adhere to some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the diaphragm or of its extension, and these two types occur due to various causes: either from a blow, or from a fall, or from shouting, or from lifting something heavy, or from similar actions.
And the sign of this, when it's due to a stretching of the diaphragm, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and not suddenly; and it is a gradual swelling towards the navel because the diaphragm is pressing on the intestine.
And the sign of it when it's due to a rupture of the diaphragm is that initially, it causes sudden and intense pain; and there is a different type of swelling appearing under the ribs close to the surface, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body being outside the diaphragm.
And sometimes the intestines are expelled along with the tissues, and this is called an intestinal hernia, or a "zirbal" hernia.
And sometimes it's caused by gas, and sometimes a tear develops in the intestines, and it's retained there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illnesses with iron, there is danger, so it is necessary to avoid using it in that situation.
And the method of surgery for this is to tell the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity with their hand if it returns, and then carefully place the patient on their back, holding their hands, and elevate their legs.
Then, carefully dissect the sheath that holds the testicles, opening it from above, and cut the sheath of the testicles all along its length; then, with a pair of forceps, separate the two edges of the incision according to how you need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision is sufficient, you will be able to remove the testicle from it.
Then, scrape off the tissues underneath the sheath of the testicles, until the hard, white tunic of each part is exposed.
Then, insert your finger into the area surrounding the testicle, between the white tunic that lies beneath the testicle's sheath, and the surrounding tissue, and separate any adhesions located behind the testicle.
Then, pull the sheath of the testicles outwards with your hand, and, using your left hand, pull the white tunic upwards, raising the testicle with the tunic towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle up while you break down any adhesions behind it with a suitable solution.
And use your fingers to check that there is no intestinal tissue entangled in the hard white tunic. But if you find any such tissue, then you push it back into the abdomen.
And then cut into the area below the testicle sheath, so that blood and pus flow out, as we have described in the previous section.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the bandage we described (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we said is applied near the incision to prevent blood flow, because often this happens) and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the inflammation is delayed, then hot water should be applied, and kept on it until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with other wound remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of the windy hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that has been burned with iron as a cure.
And the earlier ones would say it is done like we have described for the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels close to the section above it with ease; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with whatever opens it up, until the vessels fall away.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that occurs in the ankles.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the ankles as we have said, and you must remove the place (or object).
And do not leave any cause of intestines in the groin; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is created in the groin until the intestine descends into the groin; and this happens because of the extension of the groin, which is in the ankles, as we have said.  This is because the groin is stretched, and then the area becomes softened and inflamed, and you remove it.
And the cure for it is with cautery, as previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with a hot iron in this way:  the patient lies on their back, with your hands on them, and then dry the area of the rupture and inflammation, removing it with a cut across its width, according to the amount of three fingers.
And then press down on the white groin below the groin until it is exposed.
And then take a stick and place it on the prominent area of the groin, and press it against the belly button.
And then stitch the two prominent places on the end of the groin stick together, and join one to the other with stitches.
And then remove the stick, and do not cut the groin completely, nor extend the testicle, nor any other such thing, as I teach you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and as you would cleanse the sores, cleanse and restore the wound until it is healed; for the groin is constricted and the rupture eminence is not mended.
And cautery is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
On softening the scrotum (or testicles).
Often the scrotum in some men softens because the flesh between the testicles softens, and its appearance is suspect.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one attending to the cure to have the patient lie down according to their side, and to separate the entire softened tissue from the natural scrotum; and then to join the two flaps together with sutures.
And if you wish, stitch the excess softened scrotum tissue first with three or four firm sutures.
Then, make incisions between the sutures; and then treat with healing salves until the wound heals and the pus subsides.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our law, is forbidden, but by reason, it is permitted to me to remember it in this book; and this remembrance is not necessary except in two ways.  One is so that the physician, when questioned about it, may know how to treat the afflicted; the other is that we often need to castrate other animals for our own benefit, such as oxen, goats, pigs, and similar beasts.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by slitting and cutting.
But in that which is done by crushing, the method of the operation is that we should immerse the animal in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then grasp them with your hand until they are broken and no longer appear beneath the touch.
However, in castration by slitting and cutting, you must hold the animal and press the scrotum with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut into each testicle with a cut until both testicles are separated.
And then cut those further, once each is skinned. And do not leave any cause of the scrotum's outer layer, but only the delicate lining that covers the vessels.
And this method of castration, by rubbing, is better, for strong rubbing leaves no cause of the testicles that makes the animal desire mating.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when a space appears in the scrotum, between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs.
And sometimes urine flows from the area between the testicles.
But in women, it's a single type: the woman's vulva over the pubic bone is like two male testicles, slightly reduced in size, positioned externally, like the male foreskin, and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: for two of the types in men and one type in women. And it is necessary to cut those adhering tissues until the pressure is released, and then treat those wounds with the treatment for other sores.
And in the second type in men, where urine is in the area between the testicles, there is no cure nor surgery for it.
Chapter 21.
Of lens-like swelling and protruding flesh due to (afflictions of) women.
A mild swelling is often caused by natural causes until it is compressed and becomes less noticeable; and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it spreads just like in men and interferes with sexual intercourse.
Then you should remove the excess swelling with your hand or with a lancet.
And do not cut deeply, especially at the base of the root, so that you do not cause excessive bleeding.
And then treat it with the treatment for sores until it is healed.
But flesh that is born within the womb of the mother until it fills it, and easily emerges from the parts outside resembling a tail (and therefore some early writers called this "tail disease"); thus, we must cut it as we cut swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of [a disease called] alratica.
Alratica is when the opening of the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that has preceded it, and that illness is caused either by improperly aligned flesh or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it happens either in the mother's groin, or in her ribs, or in the highest part of her womb, or in the lowest part, and you prohibit coition, and impregnation, and childbirth, and strongly prohibit menstruation.
And the knowledge of that is obtained through observation of the midwife, if the blockage is apparent, treat it quickly; but if it is not apparent, then you seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the blockage is due to a thin membrane, and is close to the two lips, then you cut and break that.
And you should place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers of both hands together on top.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully extend the two lips until that thin membrane is broken and the blockage is open.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it over the area, and let the patient rest with a man by their side that day so that the incised area doesn't heal.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you must cut it with a sharp blade or a myrtle leaf.
But if the blockage is due to a clot, then suspend that with forceps, and cut it.
And have with you the remedies that stop blood flow without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and fennel, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it for a few days and apply poultices of dry herbs.
And then it should be treated with another healing method until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the major birth of other flesh, and then it is necessary to cut according to this method. However, if this is due to a cranium abscess, no iron should be used to treat a cranium abscess in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and of the cut and red inflammation that occurs in the vagina of women.
Hemorrhoids are the enlargement of the openings of many veins through which much blood continually flows; and when hemorrhoids are long-standing and fistulas are formed.
And I have already stated in the division the species of those [hemorrhoids] and their signs, and will now say which ones receive treatment and which ones do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and fistulas, when they are deep within the rectum and do not appear on the surface,  then no treatment with iron should be done on them.
But those which are at the opening of the rectum, where one can feel them, are those which can be cured.
And you must place the woman in a cool place and then carefully cut away the fistula with scissors, or with a harsh cloth, and cut them away with the roots.
Then, sprinkle over them the flow of blood from one of the cutting powders without biting, like acacia and similar things.
And then bathe their feet for an hour, and afterwards place them in cool water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then have them sit in a decoction of sumat, and of quince bark, and of berries, and of similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a poultice with this on their back.
And if the blood has stopped, good; and if not, apply two leeches, and to the breasts without making incisions.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or juice of arnagloza, or juice of rue, mixed with diluted wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a bone fracture in the arm.
Many types of abscesses occur in the arm, such as cancer, stone-like abscesses, ulcers, swellings, eruptions, fistulas, hemorrhoids, sores, and other types of abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses and their types, their symptoms, and their treatments in the division.
And it is necessary for me to discuss in this treatise a particular abscess that comes to the arm, when it is one of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you wish to know how the operation on it is performed with an iron.
Therefore, you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with percussion, phlegm, and fever, and if it shows redness and if, when pressed upon it, you feel the inflammation, then do not treat it with perforation, but cure it with what aids maturation until the sharpness of the condition subsides.
And then you should have the woman lie on a stretcher with two supports; and lean her on her side and position her feet near the lower part of her abdomen, and her thighs should be spread open, and place her arms under her armpits, and tie each of them with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife, standing on the right side, administers the instrument with which the opening in the arm is made, the form of which will be explained in the subsequent discussions.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you should insert its point into the arm of the woman, and the part of the instrument that enters the arm should only reach the arm's point, and ease the patient's suffering. But if the instrument is larger than the arm's point, then you should place powders on the surface of the arm so that the instrument is prevented from entering the arm.
And you should place the liquid that runs through the instrument on the topmost part, and have the attendant hold the instrument and rotate the liquid until the arm's opening is made.
And when the discharge appears, and it is touched by the hand and is slimy and moist, then you should dry that area around the head with a linen cloth.
And when the pus is evacuated, then you should place a medicated cloth soaked in rosemary or green oil (in which there is some astringent), and put the cloth on the affected area on the arm.
And place outside the arm, and over the forearm, a clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And it should be treated for approximately two days with the ointment appropriate for this purpose until it is healed.
And sometimes the arm and the wound are washed in such a way that they are cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long-stemmed iris has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep within the arm, then you should be prohibited from treating it with iron, following the treatment described in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living embryos when their development is not natural.
It is necessary for the midwife to know the natural pattern of childbirth from its signs.  When you see the woman pushing from below, desiring to breathe air, and is relieved from the pressure on her from the delivery, and hastens the delivery of the embryo, know that this birth is natural, and the delivery is of the embryo over its head, and the afterbirth attached or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then the woman's abdomen should be compressed so that the embryo descends easily, for when it descends over its head, it leaves the afterbirth, which is cleansed of those superfluities with proper cleansing.
But if the birth is different, it is unnatural and undesirable.  For when the embryo emerges feet first, and the body comes out before the head and feet, or one hand or foot protrudes, or the head is delivered and a hand is delivered, or a foot is delivered and a hand is delivered, or if the body is delivered with the head, or if it turns sharply around its neck – these are signs of unnatural, undesirable births.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these things, and the ingenious methods in them, so that it is signified by this and what has happened.
When the fetus emerges over its head through natural expulsion, and the labor is difficult and the woman's strength is weakened, then apply this treatment: or if the women have it, and evaporate the conh with collected fenugreek and moist oils.
And the midwife should insert her fingers into the small space and fissure, and with that remove the afterbirth, or cut it with her nail until she removes the moisture from it. And press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it doesn't descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be treated with poultices of ptilli and poultices of fenugreek with cumin.
And then order the patient, apply the poultice, that it be pressed and make the patient sneeze with force; and cover the patient's mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled soon.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then it is necessary that you return them gently, little by little. But if you don't succeed in bringing it back inside, then place the woman on a stool and raise her feet up, and then push the stool down to the ground; and hold the woman so she does not fall during the pushing.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then cut them and remove the remainder of the fetus, or tie its body to the woman's hand with cloth and pull it out carefully, for that will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must push them upward, and then turn the fetus gently, and then swallow it, and then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you tell her to strain, and make her cough with force, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then return the fetus slowly until you place it in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with a gentle exit.
And if it is still not expelled by all of that, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, grind them thoroughly in a mortar, and then apply this mixture to the woman's vulva, the lower part of her abdomen. And then apply a compress in lukewarm water until the hypochondria (the sides of the chest) are relieved.
And when the parts below her are soothed, then apply a fumigation of myrtle and place it under her. And when the fumigation has been applied for an hour, then make her sit on a stool, and make her sneeze and tightly close her mouth, and remove that, and press the lower part of her abdomen gently with a compress, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
The fetus emerges lengthwise, using one of her hands. Be skillful in reducing (returning) the fetus with your hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if walking is not possible, then have her lie down on the bed, and forcefully compress her thighs, and then administer remedies which I have previously recommended (or listed)  made from mucilages.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, and then carefully attempt to reduce the fetus with your hand, and gently coax the fetus into the natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it is expelled.
The fetus emerges onto the mother's lap, with its arms outstretched and its face turned towards her. The midwife should hold the baby's hand and gently and progressively turn it, helping it along.
And when it is properly positioned, then apply what we have recommended of oil and mucilage to its head.
Then instruct her to gently push it out, and when you have done that, have her sit on a stool and instruct her to lean to her right side, and then instruct her to bear down; and make her sneeze with (appropriate) encouragement. The prepared fetus is delivered onto the side.
When the mother is delivered of the horrifying thing (fetus) in this manner, consider it, and then you cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
And if the fetus is hanging from the face and neck, then you cut it from the umbilical cord, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus into the appropriate parts until you place it as is proper, and instruct the woman to bear down a few times, and it will be expelled gently, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and difficult to explain; but these are things outside of nature, and not alive.
And count them, whether they are multiplied, a second one, and separate them by the cord, distinguishing them at the umbilicus of each.  And sometimes they are expelled as if a single fetus, by gentle natural means, and sometimes by unpleasant means, as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver and come to what we have said about unnatural formations, then treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is ingenious in accordance with every form suitable to the person's preparation for healing.
A recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  It has been verified by me that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all formed, the cause of which was determined by the learned men's measurements.
And all this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for it is easily recognized by such small signs, and therefore she should treat it accordingly.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus using what we have discussed in the division of medicine, and it has not emerged naturally, and you are forced to use manual procedures, then you must consider whether the woman is of healthy constitution and is not suffering from any of the conditions that cause fear of her loss.
Then the woman should be positioned on her back on the bed, with her head tilted downwards and her thighs elevated.
And the attendant should hold her in those two places, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body does not move or stretch away from the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils and with mucilage of marsh-mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where she can hook her fingernails onto the fetus.
And suitable places for this:  Then consider if the fetus is ready to descend headfirst, and then you should hook your fingernails into its scalp, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or in its armpits, or in the appropriate spots on the ribs, or under the lower ribs.
However, if the descent is feet first, then in the perineum, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the fingers with the right hand, and place the curve of the finger in the area between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and hook the finger into any of the places we mentioned, until reaching the empty cavity (or opening).
And then place and hook another finger, or a third if necessary, in close proximity to the first, so that it is a pulling action, and is not just an extension of the previous one.
And move it in all directions, so that its extraction is eased, just as a tooth is extracted.
And it is necessary in that area between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary for the midwife to grease some of her fingers with oil and insert those fingers and twist the retained part.
Therefore, if the part of the object is forced out, then the fingers should be moved to a higher location; and do this until the entire object is expelled.
But if the hand has slipped out before the other, and it is not possible to return it by retracting it, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is completely expelled, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus it is necessary that you do the same for the other hand and both feet.
But if the head of the object is large, or if constriction is applied to its protrusion, or if water is accumulated on its head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the spines, split the head, and remove the water, or to break it with an instrument called "alundat," the shape of which will be found with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
And similarly do so if the object has a large head by nature: and then it is necessary to cut it with a knife, or to remove it with an alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has protruded and is constricted towards the fork, then it should be split until the moisture that is in the feet is drained away.
But if it is not complicated, nor obstructing a protrusion, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscess-ridden or hydrops-affected, then it is necessary for you to puncture it until the moisture within it is drained.
But if the object is on its feet, then the pull on it is gentle and its direction towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is constricted towards the belly and feet, then you must remove it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut the belly and feet until what is inside is released.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she inserts her hand into the air space, searches for the head with it, and pulls it with her fingers towards the mother's mouth. Then she inserts a finger, or two fingers, and pulls it with them.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by a boil or ulcer that arises inside, then it should not be forced; instead, it is necessary to administer a poultice of greasy, moist substances. And apply plasters; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if possible, it should be turned; and administer what we have said about the living fetus.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed.
And it is necessary to not leave any cause within the afterbirth.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of the boils which occur in the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then apply styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman whose belly contained a dead fetus, and soon after, became pregnant again, and another dead fetus resulted. A long time ago, an abscess appeared near his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and medicated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied some strong-drawing plaster to him, and a bone came out of him, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised, as there are no bones inside the belly.
And then I thought that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I treated the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in her usual condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, getting better little by little.
And I did not consider this strange, but rather that in this lies knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician administers with his hands for healing.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary for extracting the fetus.
Form of twisting with which the womb is opened:
This is the form of tightening in which the books are bound, to which binding are two twists at the two ends of two cords. However, this twist should be more subtle than a constricting one, and should be made either of a ribbon or a wooden stick.
And the width of each stick should be about two fingers, and the margin of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two sticks are two attachments of that same stick, which are already fastened, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb so that it is opened with those when you revolve the two prescribed twists.
Another similar form, more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of wood or ivory, similar in shape to forceps. However, at its extremity, there are two additions, just as before, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the womb with these, then you have the woman lie on her back, her feet hanging, and open the space between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, as with forceps, likewise, according to the amount you want to widen the opening of the womb, until the midwife does what you want.
The form of dizziness, which the ancients said:
Form of impulse by which the fetus is propelled:
Form of friendship/affection/love with which the large head is contained.
And it resembles forceps, which have teeth at the extremity, as sometimes happens, and sometimes it is made long, like forceps of this shape, as sometimes happens, with teeth like saw teeth, with which it is incised and contained. Form of slight affection/love/friendship:
Form of a hook having a spine/point/projection:
Form of a hook having two spines/points/projections:
Form of a spatula with two ends, with which the head is severed/cut off.
Form of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments are used, and the more the varieties of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the lighter their operation is and the more esteemed they are by men due to their quantity.
And you should have those instruments ready, wherever you are, for the need for them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should command the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a remedy, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils.  If by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a bowl and perforate a hole in its cover, and place inside it herbs, opening the mother's mouth, such as mint, rue, fennel, chamomile, Arabic gum, cinnamon wood, and St. John's wort. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the bowl, and place that bowl over the fire.
Then place a reed cannula into the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the cavity of the mother.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if, despite this treatment, it remains lodged and does not come out, then you command the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or in a mixture of marshmallow, and then introduce it into the vagina and use it to seek out the afterbirth.  And once she has found it, then she should pull it out gradually. But if it is attached to the womb, then she should introduce her hand as we have described, and when she has found the afterbirth, she should remove it slowly and cautiously so that the mother does not suffer from undue traction. Beforehand, it is necessary that it be moved from side to side with ease.
And if the mother's cervix is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and with herbal poultices.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then be careful not to strain it further by pulling, but rather it is necessary that whatever has come out of her vagina lies on the woman's thigh, and then anoint it with ointment and a four-drug compound.  For that will cause it to decompose after a few days and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it decomposes, there is a foul odor rising from the head and stomach, which weakens the patient; and then fumigations and appropriate remedies must be administered.
But some of the ancients have already tested fumigations with narcissus bulbs and dried figs.
Form of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for retained menses and afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And place the thin end in the container and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed above the fire's flames.
And keep it until the fumigation is consumed and then repeat another one.
Treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which are already tight and obstructed. Then the midwife should perforate that obstruction with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the sphincter.
And then place some wool soaked in wine and oil over it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it is obstructed, then insert a cannula into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wishes to swallow.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a plague or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the cure and lead.
Of the treatment of fistulas that develop afterwards.
The fistulas that develop in the lower area, swollen and large, which develop near the anus externally or in the space of the lower area.
And it is a fistula or multiple ones.
And when that swelling is old and originates from watery white moisture or a subtle putrefaction, and sometimes these fistulas are even penetrating.
And those that are penetrating are known because of what has exited from them through excretion and by flatulence; and sometimes the patient experiences excretion, and often worms emerge from them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some of these penetrate into the hip joint and into the knee joint.
And how one recognizes a penetrating fistula in the anus, as opposed to a non-penetrating one, is that you insert your index finger into the anus, and gently probe for a narrow opening or metal rod within the fistula, if there is no twisting or distortion.
But if there is twisting in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair against your finger.
And if you do not feel any of this at all, nor does any discharge of matter, worms, or flatulence proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know it to be non-penetrating, and then dedicate yourself to the cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then the sign of it is frequent urination and preventing it until the area is healed with medicine.
However, if it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then the sign of it is that the probe passes through until it reaches the bone, if there is no twist inside the bone and pain in the surrounding area; and that it will likely always be sore; and that treatment for it is ineffective, nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the cure for them is the effort and vanity of learned physicians, on which it depends.
However, in those that are not penetrating and are not old, healing with iron is expected, as I have told you, and this I have already tested.
And it is necessary that the patient lies between your hands on his back, and elevate his legs upward, and the thighs should be inclined towards his stomach, and then insert a lead probe or, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe passes through.
And if that sensation is around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe penetrating by itself on your finger, or if you feel something between your finger and that tissue or flesh, then know for sure that it is penetrating; and therefore do not work on it, for there is no cure in it, as we have said.
But nevertheless, some might say that it heals in some men slowly.
And the treatment by which improvement is expected in him is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously described, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fleshy, fistulous areas resembling a bird's feather shaft have been cauterized.
And then treat it with some bandages until all those cauterized tissues have healed, and then treat it with medicines that generate and strengthen the flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate to your fingertip in the anus, and between it and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula's opening is on the surface of the anal canal, then cut the anal canal from the beginning of the fistula, and cut with the probe, and let it remain in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the tip of the probe arrives, and by the probe it is released and extracted.
And then clean those fistulous tissues, which resemble the shaft of a bird's feather, and leave no cause for concern.
But if bleeding occurs between you and your procedure when cauterizing those tissues, then the best and most straightforward instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire has two good effects: it is the cauterization of those tissues and the excision of blood, removing the moisture.
And then treat it with bandages or a finely woven cloth until the area heals, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and strengthen strong flesh.
And those medicines that include astringency and excision; when it is thus restored, it is already healed and you need not fear a recurrence.
However, if the fistula extends to the anus and is distant from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And thus, if you feel a resistance, and between you and it there is a covering of tissue or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no surgery to be done there, but rather only a route of trust and hope.
Which condition can be addressed in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or excise it until you reach its cavity, so you can insert medicaments and promote healing; and do not perform much excision, lest you injure the surrounding tissue containing the gut, and cause harm to the patient without their consent; and then treat it with what we have said, for it will be easily healed; or, separate the membrane and drain the pus that you excise close to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp end, and then clean the fistulous flesh that you have excised, to where you can use cauterization; and then endeavor to restore the entire wound with excision, and if the opening above is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the anal region, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is completed in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the fold of the anus near the body's surface, with the tissue and at the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a pointed end, which is like a needle for preparing the skin in this form:
and insert into it a fine thread wrapped with five threads, or around them; then insert the thread with the probe into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it is penetrating at the margin of the anus close to the inside, then you pull the thread from that opening, as if you insert your finger into the anus; and extract the thread's end and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you further cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh is cut between both ends of the thread and falls away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in any way you are prepared, but not too far into the perineum, for it is not for you to do this so that you do not cut the ligament; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the spatula with which the fistula is opened: the curve of which is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are like lumps of coal on the anus, or they are like grapes. And they are small or large, and the blood flows from them continuously, and are one or many, and are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the measures of little moisture, from which flows yellow water or a little blood with a continuous flow, and this is according to the color of the flow.
And the treatment of those inside the anus is to tell the patient to sit and strain until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grasp them and suspend them with tweezers or hold them with your fingernail, and then cut them off at their roots.
However, if the tweezers are not holding them due to their moisture and softening, then grasp them with a rough cloth or cotton or a wool pad, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them off and sprinkle some hot powders on their cuts, so that they are in the place of cautery; or cauterize them as is detailed in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not open, then prick the patient with a prickle in which there is a small bite, and wash it with what is in the anus, and that it opens slightly when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause of them is mild, and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or with tweezers, and cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And for the incision you have made, you should apply sutures to them like this: take a thread wrapped around it, and insert it into a needle. Then pull the hemorrhoids apart.  Push the needle through the base of the other side. Wrap the two ends of the thread in a horizontal line, just below the needle. Tie the hemorrhoid tightly with the thread, and then remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one, and do not sew it, so that the excess blood flows from that one.
And then place a cloth soaked in warmed oil or ointment on the anus, and put it on the patient's rear and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it until it drops out; and when it has fallen out, treat it with ointments or other remedies until it is healed.
And if they are old and do not respond to that treatment, then you should scrape them with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist and the pus-covered skin above is removed, which prevents their healing; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then remove them with a more forceful scraping than the first until a lot of blood comes and they are scraped clean; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that fistula, this is the key, and it is not anything but a round swelling the color of the body, like the head of a nail, and it appears throughout the body, but especially below the feet and in the fingers, and due to those pains, one should investigate the swelling.
Then it is necessary that what is around the swelling be incised, and held with forceps or tweezers, and the root of the swelling be removed; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round elevation on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to spread and incise it, or to squeeze it with a file or a needle until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But a pimple is a small, ulcerated or fistulous, thick elevation on the body's surface, often appearing on the genitals.  When the cold touches it, one feels a sensation similar to an ant bite, and it is spread around the body.
And its treatment is to take a hollow tube, made of a bird's feather or a vulture's feather, and it should be strong. Place it over the pimple until the tube encircles the affected area. Then, rotate your hand with the tube to cut through the pimple's surrounding tissue, and press it into the flesh to eradicate the pimple from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube made of bronze or iron, following this method:
Let the part above the tube be thin, solid (that is, not perforated), and wrapped so that the grip on it is firm and its rotation is smooth.
And if you wish, cauterize the pimple as described previously in the section on cauterizing boils in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the forms of instruments used for providing care.
Sometimes care is provided with silver or brass or bronze, cast or hammered; and sometimes small or large instruments are used, depending on the patient's needs.  The instruments used for treating small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are sore or painful, the care instruments should be small as well.
The form of large and small care instruments:
The head of the cannula, upon which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a clear distinction where the bag is tied, as it is done often.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the anus, should be very firmly closed (that is, not open), tapering to a narrow point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little larger on one side.
And the bag, in which the bladder medicines are placed, be it of animal bladder or sheepskin, should be one palm in depth.
And it should be pierced with many holes, as it is rolled; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong, potent, raw bile, which should be ten parts, or roughly that amount; and fasten the bag with that.  When the bag is placed on it, tightly bind the top of the pouch between two distinct points with strong constriction. Then bind each hole with that binding.  However, the manner of binding it is that you fill the bag with medicine, that is to say, warmed to a degree commensurate with the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
And now the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs up and place a cloth or sheet underneath them; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then insert that into the anus with ease, and the attendant should then take the pouch and squeeze it with both hands forcefully, until all the contents are evacuated into the bowels.  Then remove the pouch and the patient lowers their legs to the side.
And if the medicine causes him to sweat, keep him in that condition for as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is better for his recovery.
However, if you cauterize for illnesses of loose bowels and sweating, then you repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the anus, then the cautery should be very fine and gentle, like the cauteries used for children.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of plagues what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of those with hand and with medicines according to their condition.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diverse depending on how they are created and on the location on which the plagues occur.
And the causes why plagues are often made are like the throwing of a stone, or cutting with a knife or sword, or striking with a lance, or with a club, or with an arrow, or similar to these from many causes.
But the plagues that are in the parts of the body are like the plague that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the stomach, or the liver, and similar to these in the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the recollection of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is caused by a thrown stone or similar, and only the skull is cracked, and it is a serious wound, and you fear the development of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should quickly bleed the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract from him blood according to the extent of his strength, unless some cause prevents bleeding, especially if the blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And the bleeding should be on the opposite side of the affected part; and the patient should be guarded against repletion, and against strong food and drinks.
But if any reason prevents the bleeding, then the diet should be reduced, and he should not approach meat or wine.
And if an abscess develops on the wound, apply a poultice made of oil and herbs or wine with astringents.
But if you are certain of a hot abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and if the air has not changed the powder that I will shortly recount.
And if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is caused by a cut or similar injury, and its edges are not brought together by sutures, then bring them together with stitches, as I will explain about their suturing.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and it's not a serious injury but rather a small detachment, then cut away that part and treat the wound with medicines, and restore the flesh in place of the tendon, and tell the patient to eat foods rich in fat: heads and feet of fowl and similar things, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the tendon and it is not adhering to the bone, then you cut away all the putrid material and discard it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood might flow, and it is not severed by medicine, then you look for the artery, and if you find it not severed, then you cut it with a scalpel, or tie it off; and if necessity dictates that what we have said is not sufficient, then you cauterize until the blood is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; thus you powder them with this powder, for it will solidify them before the air spoils them.
And the recipe for the powder is this: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched lime; all finely ground and sifted, and apply it to the wound, and firmly bind it until it adheres well to the wound and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it over with bandages and leave it, and do not remove it until it is healed, for the medicine is not effective until the wound is healed.
And sometimes it is sufficient with just a cautery, if you do not have  oils and dragon's blood at hand.
And you do this same treatment for large wounds when it is necessary to apply it to them and bind them, especially fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not yet altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then this powder application is not appropriate.  Instead, treat them with the remedies mentioned earlier.  Or, apply digestive ointments to them, or a poultice of barley flour mixed with water and honey until it hardens; then follow up with the other treatments until the wounds heal.
But if you encounter a wound with a fractured bone, and it's small, then you extract it with skill.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of wounds to the neck.
But if the wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple head wound.
But if the nerve or artery of the neck is cut, if it's a nerve, then there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with anything that causes intense astringency, such as zinc or vitriol, or similar things that damage and constrict the nerves. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if this is treated with mild medications, such as washing with fresh water, sometimes infused into oil, whether rubbed or not, and a poultice when washed with fresh water and other minerals according to this method, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or close its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or extends to the lowest part of the bone, then perforate it in the most depressed place.
But if an artery is already cut in the wound and blood flow is occurring, then separate or cut off that artery, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or the entire neck are already cut, and the veins of the neck are spared, then you must suture the edges of the wound along the spine of the neck and do not touch it; rather, align it and restore it to its natural form, and then tightly bind it with appropriate bandages, and leave it for several days; then treat it with ointments that contain astringents and stimulants until it is healed.
But if the wound has already reached the bone, you must clean it, and if there are bone fragments, remove all those you can; and whatever you cannot remove, leave it until the wound is suppurated, separated, and the pus is eased.
And if the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder that has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what the recollection will bring forth in its chapter.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if the wound produces windiness when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is deadly.
And if there is no great depth, and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you place on it, in the first hour, powder, and do not press it, so that the blood is not retained in its depths and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply a drawing ointment, and renew it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available to you, then you place old cloth on the wound opening, so that it draws out the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that whatever is accumulated there may drain out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound, and you do not see spasms or tremors in the patient's heart or constriction of the throat, nor other bad signs, then know that the wound is safe; and then cure it with poultices and other remedies until it is healed.
But if the healing is hindered, and it is always open, then know that a fistula has formed; thus treat it by its own chapter.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or a sword, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with what is prescribed for sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if the wound has already penetrated the bone, and you have already cut out pieces from it, then you should squeeze the wound and try to remove those pieces, if they are detached. But if they are not detached, then leave them until the wound can close, for their removal is eased.
And for other wounds occurring in other limbs, the guidance in treatment is the same as what we have said.
Of wounds of the belly.
The ailment which occurs in the belly is either severe, or mild, or moderate.
And a minor rupture is more difficult to repair in another way, and it is seen that the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not return the intrusion of them to their place promptly, for it will open up and become swollen, making the re-entry difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is a moderate one, for in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two aforementioned types.
And know that the suture of the belly is according to four methods, but two sutures are common, which apply to sutures of other wounds in the body.
And two other specific sutures are applicable to other wounds, but nonetheless are more specific in the suture of the belly.
And I will explain each to you with exposition and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has protruded through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is so, then you should warm it in this way: either you immerse a damp sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or you infuse it in water with squinant, cyperus, and spic, and apply it to the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, this works better in cases with astringency, and it's better than plain water in resolving the inflammation.
And when you see the inflammation resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallow have been cooked, for this eases its condition with little effort.
But if the condition of the intestine is not eased by this treatment, then carefully cut the rupture slightly with an instrument used for hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better, when it is properly applied without resorting to incision, and there should be no need to dry it excessively or cause further damage.
Of the instrument, take its shape (or form):
One part of it is sharp, the other part blunt, and the tip is fine, but not as fine as a needle; rather, it is slightly blunt.
And therefore, if the rupture is extensive and the intestine is protruding, then the reduction must be done in the natural way, returning it to its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and in the lower part of the abdomen, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then raise the head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then always focus your attention and consideration on ensuring that the part containing the rupture is higher than the other.
And thus you must administer this in large and medium ruptures.
And in small ruptures, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant stand between your hands, holding the rupture with one hand and gently bringing the edges together, and then examine for any other cause requiring further stitching.
And this is the common method of suturing: take a needle, or several needles depending on the size of the rupture; then place one at the edge of the rupture with the ring finger, and hold the needle in such a way that you do not put tension on the two ends of the thread, with the two ends of the suture material under the thread of the edges inwards, until you cause it to penetrate into that part. And now you have joined two ends of the thread and two ends of the suture material, which makes four stitches.
Then tighten with a double thread around the needle, sometimes from two sides simultaneously, and then bring the edges and the rupture together properly; then leave the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, and then tie it with thread just as you tied with the first needle; and do not stop doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completely closed the rupture.
And the needles should be medium in thickness between coarse and fine, for the fine needles pierce the flesh too lightly; and the thick ones are difficult to thread, therefore they should be medium in fineness and thickness.
And the needle should not be placed too close to the two ends of the thread, so that the flesh is not pierced too lightly and the rupture is opened before its healing.
And the sutures should not be prolonged, so that the rupture is not hindered from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not bother the patient during their rest; and you will place over the suture expanded powders on all sides, holding the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the rupture is already healed.
And this type of suturing with needles is most appropriate for small wounds, for in their suture only one or two, or so, needles are sufficient.
However, the second method of suturing is more common: and it is that you suture all four ends of the thread and two ends of the bandage, all at once, using a needle that is tightly wrapped in a delicate, yet substantial, way.
And then, after you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same point you started, so that the thread pulls back from the most profound part of the wound, so that the suture will be firm, like the way fabrics are strengthened by weaving.
And place between each suture the width of a little finger.
And this suture pleases the people (or is known/used by people).
And with this method of suturing, I healed a wound that had befallen a man in his abdomen, where he had been wounded with a knife.  The wound was a gap of more than a palm, and intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle of the wound, rupturing the middle of the internal organ.  I was able to return the intestines which had been outside the wound after 24 hours.
And the wound healed in about fifteen days, and I cured him. He recovered, and lived many years thereafter, and his condition improved.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not recover;  it was a miracle, for I did not treat him with ointments, for it was in a place where no ointments or medicines were found, but I applied warm wool to the wound twice a day, and continuously washed it with honey water until it healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures, proper according to the word of Paraula.
And it is that you begin with a suture using a needle, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus, as the needle pierces the thread and the same wound, following its length and the entire body, and leaves the tip of the thread where you inserted the needle; and push the needle from the inside to the outside of the other end of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make that penetration again in that same end of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this wound, and insert the needle from the inside to the outside of the other end.
And insert with that your penetration, with which you make that penetration into the thread at the wound's end that is on his side until all of that is penetrated.
And then, starting from this same side, stitch that with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the thread you pierced, and then return that to that thread and stitch the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the wound; and remove that from the thread that is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once more until you have sewn all that is outside according to this example.
And the sum of this method of suturing is that you sew with a method of skin stitching, with which you sew the skin, in such a way that you stitch the thread once from the end of the wound, and leave that again until you have completed it.
But the second kind of proper suture, which some call Gaulish suture, and this is told to you in detail, is that you stitch it according to a similar method as some physicians stitch it, so that they add each part to its corresponding part to him conveniently by nature; and they apply the end of another of him and the end of the wound to the other end of him, and this is done as I told you.
You must put the needle into the end of the wound near the external part, and make it penetrate to the internal part of that single wound, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in the two ends of the thread.
And then turn those (threads), and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other ends of the wound that are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common light suture, and it is a suture of which the memory precedes.
This is the Gaulish method.
And some might say, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, which means that you insert a thread into each of them, and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who know how to heal the skin equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle part of the belly, then the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of plague treatment is the same as for other plagues.
Which means that when you capture the plague fresh with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestines and stitch it and fit it properly, then apply the flesh-healing powder over it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply some ointments that you have present until they form a hard stone and the pus falls out, and are consolidated, sound and healed; and then treat it as the treatment for other plagues until it is healed.
But if the remedies are not present, then apply immediately, once it begins to cast off, old cloth, and change this twice a day, as taught to you, until it is healed, for you do not need other treatment in many cases when plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague may spread to the vital members, then you should soak lion's wool in oil of good quality, or in rubbed oil, and place it around the areas between the armpits and under the arms.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in his intestines, as often happens, then cauterize it with black astringent wine, especially if the hardness has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating opening into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is easier to heal than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called "jejunum" does not receive healing from plagues that strike it from all sides; and this is because of the vast multitude of veins in it, and by the magnitude of its volume, and the subtlety of its substance, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
But if the matter proceeding from the plague is the tissue, and you find it recent, reduce it according to your method used to return the intestines to their place.
But if it has spread to the surrounding tissues and is already green or black, then you should apply strong pressure with a poultice over the darkened area to bring blood flow, since the tissue contains veins and arteries.
And then cut the tissue around that ligament, and place the two ends of the poultice hanging down on the side of the plague, so that the pull of the matter from the diseased tissue and the emission of the plague's branch is alleviated.
A reminder of the plagues when they occur in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it is possible in some cases to restore it.  For this reason, I have seen someone who had been afflicted in their belly by a lance wound, and the plague was on the right side of the stomach. The plague was old and had become a fistula, and there was discharge and gaseous emission.
Then I considered the cure, knowing it was not a sure cure, but I attempted to refine the treatment until the area was healed and the location solidified.
And after I saw the area healed, I told the patient that further injury to their abdomen was to be expected; and no further mishap occurred and they remained in their proper state, eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and was put to exercise according to their needs.
And some experienced persons have stated that when a small rupture occurs in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner:  Take large-headed leeches.  Then bring the two edges of the rupture together and place a leech with an open mouth on the edges of the rupture.  Thus, when it has attached itself and closed its mouth, sever the leech's head, as it will adhere and not dissolve.
Then place another leech near the first, and do not stop doing this with leeches, one after another, according to the size of the entire rupture.
And then you reduce the swelling and the rupture; and those leech heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and you do no harm to the patient.
And it is possible that the intestine be bound with a fine thread, which is made from the intestine of an animal, connected to it, since it is threaded onto a needle; and you should take the end of this intestinal thread, and make it very thin, and then tie the end of this thread with the thread of the ligature, enveloped, and then insert the thread into needles and close the intestine with it, and reduce this into the rupture.
This method of suturing with leeches is only by way of trust and hope.
But if the rupture is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, for then there is no cure but a small alleviation, and it is not complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of sores and fistulas.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and is not healed, and discharges pus constantly and is not incised, then, in any limb, it is universally called a fistula, and we call that a sore.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hard, white, fibrous swelling, without pain, and with a cavity like the cavity of a bird's nest; and therefore we call that ulcer a "rized" ulcer, that is, a nest.
And in some cases it is moist, discharging pus; and easily the moisture is incised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes it is thin, and sometimes it is large, and sometimes it is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of those, and the treatment of them with medicines, in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you aware of the treatment of a fistula, which is done through surgery with the hands.
And know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that reach major veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spinal cord, or the intestine, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to any of the vertebrae of the spine, or to any of the joints formed by this connection, such as the hand and foot; and those that are close to the main part of the limb and similar ones.
Therefore, those fistulas of this type are among the illnesses with difficult healing, and they do not receive cure, and working on them is a waste of effort and ignorance.
And if any of the fistulas is not deep to the areas I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and you seek it out with it.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily guided and curved towards the winding path.
And if the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to locate them with a probe.
Then irrigate the orifices with their orifices, for the moisture with which you irrigate it goes toward the other orifices and runs through them.
And then inquire meticulously, by what means you can ascertain if there are bones or nerves, and whether the cavity of the fistula is distant or close, or if it is a fistula with many orifices and is all about this, with the utmost of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the location of the pain by your pressing with your hand on the area, and similar to the meanings and accidental causes of an abscess.
And when you have considered all those matters with true judgment, then proceed to the cure according to your confidence;  and you should consider whether the fistula is a superficial, close, or exposed fistula; or in a salty place; distant from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have told you about.
Then you should dry the fistula as previously described in the narration, and remove that which is in that filtration and putrid flesh, and that which has grown in the opening of the flesh, or of the boil and the like, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the fistula is of deep origin, and is of a severe nature, then it is necessary to incise it at its depth as much as possible for you, and then clean it of all its putrid flesh; and then administer some wraps in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have grasped with iron.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes everything that remains in the fistula's cavity of corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
However, if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not find any cause of a vein, nerve, or a major limb in it, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that promotes flesh growth until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and still discharges pus, as before, then know that you have not achieved complete eradication of the corruption; and then you open it up again more carefully, thoroughly scrape it and cleanse it with your most powerful tools, and then restore it.
And so, if it is healed, it is good; but if not, then know that the corruption lies in the distant depths of the body, which has not been reached, and so there is no remedy but to leave it alone.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then you remove it with delicate forceps suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully remove all of them, and leave nothing behind with your strength.
But if some difficulty arises from the humors, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then cut through those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if there is no preparation to remove the bones at your hour, then apply to the wound something that can hold the wound, and leave it until it is about the bones, the flesh, and the ligaments, and keep the wound from becoming consolidated, and make the incision you have made in your operation constricted.
Furthermore, if you are afraid, apply to it cotton soaked in heated oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, because when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is eased.
However, if it is a large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone or similar to those, and only the surface of it is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only from behind until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
However, if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and cut entirely to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is consolidated.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, around 30 years old, who experienced pain in his thigh, and the matter (disease) from within the body had spread to the thigh, and it was a matter of a large abscess, and it was not an external cause.
And then the condition was prolonged by the error of the physicians until the abscess opened, and many materials (pus) escaped, and its cure was delayed until the leg was fistulous, and many orifices were created in it, all of which discharged pus and the body's humidities.
And then a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and none of them were skilled in the art, until I was called upon.
And I saw his leg and the materials that flowed from those orifices in large quantities; and the man's body was already emaciated, and his complexion was yellow.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices, and the probe reached the bone.
And then I probed all the orifices and found that they led to every part of the leg.
And then I cut and incised on one of those orifices until I exposed part of the bone, and found it corrupted, already decayed and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, having penetrated into the marrow.
And then I closed what had been exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I judged that it was not in the bone, but that corruption which I had incised and closed, and I had already extracted it.
And then I applied restorative medicines to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I reopened and exposed the bone a second time over the first exposure, and found continuous corruption within the bone.
And I closed what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was forced to perform the healing and restoration of it, and it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to dissect the bone little by little, specifically, forcing its restoration, and it was not restored until I incised it around a palm's width, and extracted it with its marrow.  Then I restored that with medicines, and it was slightly consolidated and healed.
And no further repetition in the operation and sectioning of it is necessary except for the weakness of the patient, and the patient's low tolerance and fear of death, for the patient had fainting spells at all hours due to excessive evacuation, a bad syncope.
And so it was healed entirely, and there was no soft flesh in the place of the bone; and its condition within the body was good, and its strength returned; and it was restored to its original condition, and it caused no difficulty in walking or harm in any way.
But if the bone is protruding from its place in the body, then you should section it in this way:  You should take a bandage and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone, and order someone to extend that outward; and place a thicker woolen bandage over the first bandage; and then bind it over the flesh beneath the bone, and extend the end of the bandage to pull the flesh back into its place, and you should uncover the flesh in the area you wish to cut so that the cutting doesn't harm the flesh.
And place a stick or board under the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut is not prohibited from severing the corrupted flesh.
And the incision should be made on the corrupted area little by little, because if the corruption is in the hollow of the bone and not apparent to the senses, it will need to be incised again.
And if the bone is corrupted but not protruding, with one part continuing into the other, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you should uncover all the flesh; then place a stick underneath, and then cut along the first part where the corruption is until the incision continues to the other part.
And let the incision be along the area of the corruption, a little bit at a time, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and cut the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not a reasoned thing but rather an unnatural process.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever way appears to you, and cut and cleanse it according to every possible method, and by any means rectify it, as long as it doesn't injure any vein or nerve.
And know that the incisions and saws to cut these bones are very specific to the placement of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, size, and smallness, and their hardness and rarity.  Therefore, you must prepare instruments appropriate to every type of operation.
And know that this operation indicates to you the type of instrument you need; when you have great study, long experience, and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience with the nature of illnesses, then you yourself will already know what instruments are appropriate for each illness.
And I am now providing you, at the end of this chapter, a list of the instruments you will use, along with simple instructions, for your procedures, which you will test on others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of ray: Let the head of this ray be in the shape of a star-shaped key head, and its points be in the shape of the points of an alstefegi.
And it is not fitting except that with that [the ray], the heads of the joints be rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth [of the joint] is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a lateral razor:
Shape of another well-made saw:  Its arch should be made higher, and its cutting edge should be of iron, and its handle of well-made wood. Shape of it:
Shape of a razor that has a concavity:
Shape of another very thin razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved end:
Shape of a small razor resembling a tentacle:
Shape of another smaller cutting tool:
Shape of another cutting tool; this one resembling a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is found in many places in the treatment of bones:
Shape of a ray which is appropriate for the treatment of a bone that has been perforated:
And its end is triangular and has a sharp tip.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, all the things we have described about razors, cutting tools, and saws should be.
Of the cutting edges and the sawing of bones.
The extremities can be damaged either by an internal or external cause, or if your treatment with these medicines does not improve the condition, or sometimes the damage moves towards the limb not affected by any cause.  Then, you must cut into that limb, up to where the damage has spread, to make sure the patient is saved from death or severe injury, which is a greater harm to the limb.
And the sign of the affected area is that the limb becomes black, as if a fire has already burned it, or the blackness can spread until the hardness affects that limb and the entire body; and therefore cut it with a surgical incision.
And similarly, if the cause of the damage is a blow from venomous things, such as a scorpion, a viper, or a weasel, and similar creatures.
And if the damage or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger and do not allow the damage to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if the damage reaches the hand, then you cut the hand from the base of the wrist, and do not allow the damage to spread to the arm's socket.
And if, instead, it affects that area, then cut the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the damage goes beyond the elbow, then in that case, death of the patient is certain; and administering any other remedy for this is a waste of effort.
And similarly, do the same for the foot. When the damage reaches the toe of the foot, then you cut it down to one of the joints.
And if it spreads to the sole of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it goes up to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the damage has already reached the knee, then there is no cure for him but to let him go, and leave the patient to die.
And the way to cut or sever the limb is to tighten the ligament in the part below where you want to cut, and tighten another ligament over the spot; and the surgeon should extend a ligament to the lower parts, and extend another ligament upwards; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a wide blade until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be cut or severed.
And it is necessary to place cloths around all parts so that the wound does not touch anything, and that the patient receives a well-fitted and carefully treated abscess.
But if you cause a flow of blood when you operate, then you cauterize the wounded area carefully, or put some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I relate to you what happened to a man on his foot, this same accident which I and you have discussed, which is that he got a blackening on his foot with a burn that resembled a fire's combustion.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it spread to the entire foot.
And then the man himself prepared, because he saw the healing of the limb proceed with the intensity of what he felt in pain and burning, and he incised that foot down to the joint, and was healed.
That same corruption happened to him for a long time in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to counteract that excess with what I could place on his hand, to cleanse his body; but the excess was not repelled, and it began to spread to the other fingers until it began to affect his whole hand.
And he urged me to cut his hand, but I did not want to do this, hoping for the expulsion of that excess, and fearing that the incision of his hand might cause his death, for the patient's strength was at its lowest ebb.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and word reached me that the man prepared himself and incised his whole hand, and was healed.
And I have not related this story except to be of help in understanding this disease, and that it might serve as a sign by which it is recognized and treated according to its nature.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs on a fleshy part of the body and the space of the abscess has enlarged to collect pus, and it has been broken and perforated, and pus has been discharged, leaving the area empty like a vessel, and the skin over it is thin like a fine cloth, and it has not progressed to deeper corruption, and has not affected the bone, nerves, or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
However, if the space has enlarged to the point that the corruption has spread to another part of the body, then it is called a fistula, and not a sinus.
And the treatment for it is to cut through that skin completely, just as it is involved, especially if it is thin and like a cloth, and make sure that it does not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
But if you expect the skin to adhere and that corruption has not yet spread deeper, and the skin has an opening on the surface, then treat it with an enema.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large, and the discharge has a foul odor, then irrigate it with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of oil, vinegar, and honey in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and heated over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and resembles honey.
Then take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and irrigate the sinus with that, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine there for two hours.
Then extract that with a sponge; and do this for as many days as are necessary until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.
And sometimes it is irrigated with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and you should take the ash of wood, and pour water over it; then filter that and irrigate the sinus with it until you are confident that the sinus is now closed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then irrigate it with water and honey, and add crushed herbs.  Or, irrigate it with wine and honey mixed, because the property of honey is to cleanse and wash, and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when the wine contains an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are confident that the sinus is already healed, then irrigate it with something that promotes the growth of flesh there.
And you should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with warmed oil and astringent wine; or irrigate it with other medicines and ointments that have the properties I have already described in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, preventing the enema tube from entering, then gradually widen it with a small iron, and place warm, Egyptian or basil ointment there, until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the lips together with sutures, leaving just enough room for the enema tube to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the fistula comes out is elevated to the upper parts, then you should dissect it down to the lowest point possible, so that the fistula runs downwards, for when the fistula is obstructed deep inside the sinus, the flesh will grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to dissect the sinus to the lowest bone as desired, then you must prepare the affected limb with a method that allows the fistula to drain slightly, according to what is appropriate for you, and that nothing is obstructing the fistula's passage.
But that which is over the sinus opening, must remain in place at all times, to prevent anything that is causing the fistula from coming out. And so that you may know if what is draining from the fistula is much or little, or is digested, or undigested.
And by this, consider the location of the sinus, whether the patient feels pain there, and if there is an abscess.
And when your treatment has continued in this way, and you see the matter discharged over the sinus opening is beginning to adhere or stick, then on the third day, loosen it, and when you loosen the scab, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle, thin virus has spread, then do not despair of the adhesion of it, for healing of it is on its way, for there are some people in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and in others, the opposite is true.
And if from the sinus for many days undigested matter has come out, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the medicines towards drying, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and their virtue, they become dry like a diafinicon ointment, when in it a superfluity of zegi (a type of medicinal ingredient) has been added.
The final advice for healing is to take diafinicon ointment, dissolve it in rose oil, and add old wine to it, in its substance, and then mix it thoroughly, and use that.
And similarly in this treatment, if there is no matter, use diafinicon ointment, or honey when it is cooked until thick, and apply it; or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind them all into powder, and sprinkle them over the honey while it is on the fire.  Then spread this mixture on a cloth and press it onto the sinus; or apply the thick, cooked honey to a cloth and press that onto the sinus.
Sometimes, aristolochia longa, roots of lilies (and it is *lilium celesti*), and the powder of eryngo and centaury are administered.  Grind and sift these ingredients, and mix them into the honey I have previously described. Use this mixture.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone or other hard members, or in the ligaments. Then you should treat it with a fistulous cure, as described above.
Of the treatment of whitlow, and of a bruised nail, and the incision of a swollen finger, and the cutting.
Whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of a finger or toe, and frequently arises on other fingers.  If it is prolonged and its cure is less likely, or is an abscess of a hot abscess, or is corrupt, it will produce matter until it eats away the base of the nail, and often entirely corrupts it, and often spreads its corruption to the bone until it has a foul odor, the end of the finger is blackened, and its colour is dark.
And therefore, when you have done as we have said in the division and your treatment does not succeed, you should cut away all the excess flesh remaining around the nail with an iron and then cauterize the wound with that, for cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail's appendages have already begun to press on the flesh inside, and start to prick and irritate it, then you should place a thin strip under the edge of the nail that is pricking the flesh, and push that flesh up and cut it easily, and apply the remaining flesh with burning, corrosive medicines until everything is removed. Then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut into and remove that bone, for a bone that is corrupted will never heal.
And if the erosion and corruption have spread to the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to the anticipated restoration, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail has suffered blows or friction, and there is intense pain, you must first bleed the patient, then dry the nail with a sharp lancet in a transverse cut from top to bottom, and be careful not to cut into the flesh under the nail, as you will cause the patient intense pain, and will cause the excessive inflamed flesh to grow in the area. Then treat the area with whatever soothes the pain.
However, a swollen finger, which is found in some men's hands, is easily fleshy, and is easily found in the bones, or is easily found in the nails.
And some of them are born at the base of the joint, or their origin is in some of the finger's joints. But that which is born in some joints of the finger is not harmful, and that which is born in the joints is easily inflamed.
And for those that are fleshy growths, the incision is gentle, and you should cut into that from its base with a broad lancet.
But for that which is born at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of the excision of it.
But for that which is born on the finger at the joints, you should first cut the flesh around it in a circular incision down to the bone, then use a suitable saw to sever it, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the fingers become fused together, either by the nature of the person's birth, or due to a wound, burn, or similar cause, then it is necessary to separate that fusion until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And then place linen strips soaked in warm oil between them to prevent them from fusing together, and separate them or put a thin lead plate between them until they are properly healed.
And similarly, if fusion occurs between any finger and the palm, then you should separate that fusion according to the appropriate preparation and the shape of the limb.
Concerning the cutting of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are large, twisted veins filled with melancholic excess that appear on various parts of the body, most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purge of black bile from the body several times with a strong expulsion, and afterward, bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, the cure for them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are incised and the black blood is drawn out, and the other method is that the vein is raised and entirely extracted.
The cutting of it is done in this manner: first, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, phlegmy blood in the leg is resolved; then, firmly bind the patient's leg from just above the knee to below the knee with a bandage; next, cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision; then, lift the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and downwards, until the desired amount of blood has been drawn out, which will reduce the power of the ailment.
And then bandage it, and order the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the cure by phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and this is useful to the patient.
But the raising of them is done in this way: you raise the patient's leg, if it is very hairy, and then place them in a bath and soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins are prominent; or, if a bath is not available, it is done by vigorous exercise until the limb is warmed.
And then cut the cord along the vein, either lengthwise or behind the knee, or just below the heel.
And then open the cord with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears, and it is near the appearance of that redness changing to blackness.
And then, as you empty it, you see from the cord that white thread which is a string.
And then you put a ray under that [the string] so that it is raised and pulled away from the cord, and suspend it with a hook or a lion's claw.
And then make another incision near that incision, after three days, and then scrape the cord on the part above the vein until it appears.
And then raise it and cut it in a posterior incision toward the heel, and then extract it and raise it until it is out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until all of it is out; and then cut it.
And if you are unable to extract and elevate it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread and tie it and pull it out, or insert a stick/rod under it and turn your hand around in every direction until it is thrown out. And be careful not to cut it; for if it is broken, it will be difficult for you to elevate it and it will have caused harm to the patient.
And when all of it has been expelled, then place on the affected area wool soaked in mixed oil and unmixed oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having tortuosity to which it is wrapped in parts, and is not straight as we have said, then you must cut along every part of its tortuosity and in the places where it is wrapped, and then suspend it with hooks until you have elevated it entirely.
And be careful in your incision not to cut the vein and not to harm it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not sharp like the hooks, nor does it have a sharp tip so as not to damage the vein; and it is of great flexibility, like a lion's, because if it were delicate, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; it therefore has an excess of thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like in the land of the Arabs and in the hot, arid lands of India, where there is little moisture and in which no grass or tree grows.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that arises under the skin, like when snakes, worms, and grubs, and worms that breed between the skin and the flesh, enter the body.
A sign of the onset of this condition is a violent inflammation in the leg where the vein occurs;  then the area becomes blistered;  and then the vein begins to emerge from the blister area, appearing as a sprout or plant root.
And when its extremity appears, then it is necessary to wrap a lead weight of one drachma (or two drachmas) around that area and bind it to the leg.
And as many times as any cause of this appears on the outward parts, wrap it in lead and bind it. And if it is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of it and wrap the remaining part; and do not cut that part off by the root until it has come out, for if you cut it by the root, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing abscesses and deep ulceration in the area.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from the body, and no trace of it remains within.
And from this vein, there have been cases of it growing to five palms and ten fingers in length, and it has been reported to me that one grew to twenty palms in length.
And if it is incised during its treatment, then insert a probe into the wound and perforate it with a long probe, until everything within the matter is evacuated. Then apply putrefaction-reducing remedies to the area for several days.  Afterwards, treat it as one would an abscess.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears near the joint of the foot or on the foot itself.  It has multiple openings, and from each opening sprouts a branch.
And therefore treat it in the same way as we have described in the division and with the aforementioned methods.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
This illness is called "bovine disease" in some lands near us, because it often affects cattle.  It is a small worm which is born between the skin and flesh, and it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, manifesting itself in the patient's limbs until it breaks through the skin and exits.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, serpents, maggots, and ascarids are produced in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it travels through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches the eye, it frequently causes a severe inflammation there and enters, destroying the eye.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it can only be done according to its movement and appearance as perceived, and then you must tightly bind and constrict that which is above it and that which is below it, and then you should cut open the skin over it and extract it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the most feared consequence is the putrefaction of it, which corrupts the area as we have stated.
And if you see that creature has reached the head, near the eye, then tightly bind above the eyebrow with strong constriction, and then cut open the skin over it and extract it.  The patient should use medicines to cleanse their body of bad, putrid humors, and avoid foods that produce putrefaction.
Of the section concerning the illness of the nose.
This illness is called "nafir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes upon certain limbs, and then it moves from one limb to another.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein near the arm's elbow, and after an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm ascending, but more quickly than a worm would, like liquid silver moving from place to place.
And then the pain moved to that location and settled into the muscle, and then I stayed there for an hour.
And then it moved to the other arm until it reached the other arm.
And then I observed that it was moving throughout her body as I saw; and I was very amazed by its movement from one limb to another and the speed of this movement. And I had already seen this before with my own eyes in this way, although I have seen many cases where pain moves from limb to limb. But I did not see this with my eyes in this way as in the woman.
And I did not consider it to be anything else than this, because the woman was old, with dry body and exposed veins, and in this condition, this windy sensation appeared and moved.
And it is necessary that this type of reaction does not appear in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to treat him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eyes as we have said, so you gently and lightly press on the area until this trapped wind leaves, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat that with remedies for the body and with those that expel winds, and cure them with stinky pills and with pills of serpent and similar remedies.
Of extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types, and according to the places of the body where they strike, for their diversity is that of those with large points, and small, and concave, and blunt, that is, solid; and of those that have three angles, and of those that have tongues; and of those that have fins.
And the signs of the brain are when an arrow strikes it, and pierces the bone, and exits from the skull which is above the brain, for it causes sudden violent pain, and scotoma (blindness), and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of thought and vomiting of bile, and the voice is often lost and the voice is destroyed, and white moisture resembling dust comes out from the wound, and the area looks like the flesh is rotting.
And therefore, if you see these signs, then you abstain from treatment and from extracting the arrow, unless it is on the outside.
But the signs of an arrow striking the heart, are that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were lodged in a hard, not hollow, substance; and quickly the arrow's movement is like the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and the extremities become cold, and there is cold sweat, and fainting; and thus you know that death is certain without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are the expelling of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck become inflamed, and the patient's complexion changes, and the patient breathes with great difficulty, and seeks a draught of cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the feet, the pain will be near the small ribs, and there is great suffering with violent pain and sighing, and all the muscles throughout the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then quickly there is vomiting of undigested food from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is lodged there, there is either a wound of the intestines, or the stomach, or a rupture of the intestines.  There is no hope of a cure if the arrow is not extracted.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine leaks outside, and there is some cause for it to flow out, and there is sudden pain on the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, back, vertebrae, ribs, hips, legs, and similar parts of the body, are saved depending on the greater disposition [of the patient] when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery, and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I will tell you this, what I have seen regarding these arrows, so that you can consider this in your treatment.
Which is why, in a man, an arrow struck the tear duct in his nasal cavity, and I extracted it from the other side, below the ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the region of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already buried, and only a small part of it was retrieved, with which I adhered to its shaft.  It was a large, pointed arrow, like those of the sharp-shooting Turks, with a lion's head on the tip, and lacking fletching.
And the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat.  It was an Arab arrow, and it was the kind with fletching.  I then incised above it, between two tendons, and it was already submerged in his throat.  I then carefully worked around it, and extracted it. The Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his abdomen, and I thought that he would die from it.  Then, after thirty days had passed, and no change had occurred in his condition, I incised above the arrow and worked around it, and he was healed, and no further harm befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound healed over it.  But after approximately seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her belly, and the wound healed within her, and there was no change in her bodily functions.  The woman suffered no harm in any of her natural bodily processes.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face, and the wound healed.  The arrow remained embedded, causing not much pain, and there were many such cases like this.
And I extracted the arrow from the king's prince's man, which had lodged in the middle of his nose and had already shifted slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow's lodging, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; and then I probed it with a fine probe, but I felt nothing; however, he felt a prick below the right ear, and therefore I surmised that this prick was caused by the arrow's tip.
And I applied a plaster to the area with a plaster having attractive and digestive properties, confident that the wound would become suppurative, so that the arrow's position would become apparent, causing it to dry.
And no significant complication occurred in the area where the arrow had lodged; and I continued with the plaster for many days and no complication occurred; and the wound healed meanwhile, and the patient remained from the extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened, and with the probe I tested it, and found the sharp tip of the arrow, which was adhering to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the application of that sharp medicine to the wound until the arrowhead became visibly apparent, and it took me time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, since the wound had become enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and it remained, and did not yield, then I did not cease to work and devise ways to remove it with instruments, until one day I began to remove it with specifically made forceps, as will be described in the end of this chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed that wound.
Some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound healed, and the patient recovered to full health, and there was no lasting damage.
I relate to you the method of extracting some arrows, so you may have this rule and meaning about what I have not said, for the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not understood through narration, nor does the book contain them.
A skillful craftsman compares the little with the much; and what is present with what is absent; and finds new operations and instruments necessary for the removal of foreign objects in the art when it occurs.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the limbs into which they are inserted in any other way than two: either by traction from the place where they entered, or by the opposite action from the other side.
That which is expelled from the place where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled and expelled.
And if you do not follow this procedure at the time of the wound, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh around it can heal, and the pull on it and its exit can be eased.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow the procedure, leave it for a few days and repeat the pulling and movement each day, and it will be expelled.
And if you do not follow the procedure for a few days, then you must pierce the area surrounding the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine drill until the space around the arrow is enlarged, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body, and is beyond reach, then you must search for it with probes, and if you feel it, then pull it out with instruments suitable for extraction.
And if you cannot access it due to the tightness of the wound and the depth of penetration, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should enlarge the wound until the arrow can be extracted.
And if the arrow is held by the ears, then you should carefully separate the flesh it is lodged in from all sides, using all the skill you can; and try to remove it, if you cannot by separating the flesh, then fracture the ears and twist them until it comes free.
And when you are extracting the arrow from any location, then use twisting motions of your hand and forceps on all sides to make it yield; and with the utmost skill, ensure that the arrow is not broken, and that its extraction is not difficult for you.
And if you cannot remove it immediately, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues calm down, and then attempt the extraction again when it is less inflamed. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then use the treatment methods described in the relevant chapter.
And exercise caution in cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use any possible means to extract the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, patience, and firmness, as I and you have discussed.
And therefore, reposition the arrow so that the patient is in the same posture as the arrow's impact, as this is more beneficial. But if this is not possible, then use the methods that are possible, taking into account the various positions.
However, if the arrows are projecting outward from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow extends outwards, or if the arrowhead becomes crooked due to the impact against the surrounding bone and sometimes projecting upward; then cut it there.  Make the incision according to the size of the forceps, then extract it, for it is now easily removed.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist the blade against the resistance until the arrow is drawn into the bone, and then expand it further, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is inside, then you should push it out with it.
However, if the shaft is lodged and you want to administer an impulse, then you insert it, if it is blunt, with a hollowed instrument so that the cavity is inside the arrow shaft, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument inserted into it, because the arrow is made easier to remove by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you dissect all the flesh in which the poison is, if this is possible, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow strikes the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close enough to be touched with the probe, and it is possible to cut around it, then cut around it, and beware of cutting a vein or a nerve, and remove it, then close the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Shape of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let their tips be like the beak of a bird, made like a saw, so that when they grip the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And of these (forceps) many varieties are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and the tightness of the fit.
like a ray, so that the insertion of it into the concave arrow is eased, and is pushed by that.
Of bloodletting from the veins.
The veins for bloodletting, of which there is a custom of bloodletting on 30, from which are in chapter 16, are two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the temples; and two veins in the tear ducts, called *aspicientz*; and the vein in the middle of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose; and two veins at the neck; and two veins on the upper lip; and two veins on the lower lip; and - these are called *algelic*; and two veins below the tongue. But the veins that are bled in the arms are five; of those, one is the cephalic, and is on the wild side; and the people call it "the vein of the head," and it is smooth, and a mixed vein, and it is composed of one branch of the basilic and another branch of the cephalic; and the people call that the "vein of the whole body"; and basilic is the vein that is on the domestic side, and is called "citillar," and the common people call it "the vein of the belly"; and the forearm, and it is on the forearm, and that is where it is bled, and that is the one that appears on the arm through obvious visibility; and *salvatella*, and is the vein between the said ring finger and the little finger, and is in two folds.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of them is below the bend of the knee on the wild side; and the second is *sophena*, and its location is below the leg on the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the wild side; and in the leg are other veins similar to these.
The bloodletting of the veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, fevers, and sores of the head, old evils.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is to smooth the patient's head, and rub the patient's head at the occiput in the place of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then firmly grasp the patient's neck with a bandage until the two appear, and their locations are near the ears in two depressed areas of the head; and search for that with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then you bleed with a lancet.
Then take the lancet, and it is the one that is sharp, and then insert it under the vein into the groove until the bloodletting reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and the groove to the upper parts and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers joined together or around that; and let the blood flow out as much as you want.
Then compress with cloths and leave it until it is healed.
And already, in the beginning of the book, the incision of those [veins] and their cauterization have been discussed.
But for the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the remedy for phlebotomy is for chronic migraines, and for frequent eye diseases and a flow of acute superfluities (excess fluids) poured onto the eyes.
And the procedure for phlebotomizing those [veins] is as I recommend to you:  press the patient's head with your hand until the two veins become visible to the touch, and the pulse of them is felt beneath your finger; and then you should seize them with forceps.
Then you raise the skin over the vein with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy instrument beneath, and elevate the vein upwards; and incise it as you did the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the amount needed.
Then release the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then apply a compress and powders, and tightly constrict that area, and leave it until it is healed.
And the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction is already preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the remedy of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is appropriate for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in old diseases of the face, and for migraines, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the method of phlebotomy of the patient is as I recommend to you:  the patient should tightly bind their neck with a bandage until the vein appears;  and then take the instrument, which is called a "fossor" (digging tool), of which this is its shape:
Place the pointed end of the fossor on that vein, and strike it with a hammer or other suitable tool in a manner like this, and let the blood flow according to the amount you desire; and then release the patient's wound and compress it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however, it is not appropriate for the phlebotomy to be of a sharp end like other phlebotomies, but rather of a blunt end;  and phlebotomize it across, because the bone is close and strong, and would easily break the phlebotomy if it were thin.
But the remedy of the two veins that are near the lacrimal ducts, for scabies of the eyelids,  for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for facial diseases.
The procedure for phlebotomy is that the patient should bind their neck with a bandage, then the phlebotomy is performed, and you should be standing over the patient's head.
And the phlebotomy should be performed transversely, a little lengthwise with a shallow incision, for there is little flesh in the area; and if the phlebotomy is thin, the point of it will easily be broken.
And then allow the blood to flow as much as you need, and apply a compress, and bind it for a night, and then loosen it.
However, phlebotomy of the nasal vein is appropriate for acute fevers and violent headaches, and for facial ailments, migraines, and redness that appears on the face, especially if it is chronic.
The procedure for nasal vein phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck, and you should hold their nose with your left hand, take a thin, long lancet and insert it into the middle of the bridge of the nose, along a straight line, because the vein is not easily seen there, and because the blood will start flowing immediately.
You should gently move the small lancet and allow the blood to flow as needed; and then bind it for a night, for it will heal easily.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins applies to tightness of the chest, the beginning of leprosy, many illnesses, and impetigo, as well as malignant, corrosive ulcers, and herpes.
The procedure for phlebotomy of those veins is that the patient should hold each side of their neck with a bandage; and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a stool.
Then, phlebotomize the vein with a wide lancet, slowly; and then extract blood in a moderate amount, or as needed; and then do the same to the other vein.
Then untie the bandage and apply a moderate constriction to the two veins, so that the patient is not harmed, and leave it until morning, for the wound will be healed.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the veins in the head, helps with small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and gum rot, and malignant ulcers and fissures, and malignant ulcers that are on the nose and around it.
The procedure for phlebotomy of those veins is to have the patient sit before you, and tie their neck with a bandage, and then pull their lips apart and locate two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left; and the identification of each is by the darkness of each of them, and this is because around these are small black veins; and then cut each one with a precise incision.
But if there is doubt, and you don't know which is which, then proceed with the incision of the largest and most obvious of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
However, for two veins below the tongue, the benefit is often in phlebotomy of the cephalic veins near the throat, for diseases of the uvula, and for illnesses of the mouth.
And the method of phlebotomizing them is to have the patient lie between your hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look beneath the tongue.  From one side, one vein, and from the other side, a vein.  The color of each is tending towards black.
And then phlebotomize each one; and beware that you do not injure your hand while phlebotomizing them, for below those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which are customary in all men, and their phlebotomy is performed in two ways: either with a lancet dipped in mirtle or olive oil of subtle decline; or with a knife lancet, and is called `alnessil`.  And this is its form:
Its shape is such as the other times, and it is appropriate to open the concave, full veins, those appearing thick, and those which contain thick, troubled blood.
And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and a more subtle extremity, and is appropriate for phlebotomy of thin veins containing thin, citrus-like blood.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it draws blood from illnesses below the throat and neck, and from those affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, to be very careful and cautious, for there is an artery below it.  If he errs and misplaces the phlebotomy incision, he will cut the artery, causing a flow of blood.  Therefore, one should not phlebotomize this vein with a sharp instrument; instead, it should be incised with a scalpel.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you should leave it and move to another vein, or look for a branch of it, or phlebotomize in a visible area of the arm, because that is evident.  And cut that vein with a scalpel phlebotomy, as we have said.
However, if you want to phlebotomize the same vein, then you should first constrict the arm until you find the location of the pulse, and then gently press on it with your hand.  Then, bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel, as we have said.  Be careful that the incision does not extend near the artery.
And when you squeeze the ligature, if swelling occurs at the spot you marked with your hand, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is arterial blood.  Then you should stop and place your finger over it for a while.  Then remove your finger, and if the blood is separated (often it is), then you should tighten the arm and leave it alone.
And watch the patient closely, and take precautions for them and do not allow them to move about for a few days until they are healed.
However, if the blood is not separated, and you find you have no suitable medicine for this, then you should cut the artery if it appears to you; since its extremity is constricted, and the blood is separated. Or take the bark of a fig tree, and powder it, and take one half and press it on the vein's location with a descending ligature, using powders until the next day.
And if the blood is separated, that is good; and if not, then treat it with whatever was mentioned earlier for remembering the spot of the powders separating the blood flow.
And the separation of the blood is difficult in many positions because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of the arm's binding.
But from the deep vein, phlebotomy is beneficial in that you draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious in their phlebotomy, because below it is a nerve; and if he hits the nerve while puncturing for the phlebotomy, it will cause the patient stupor, and the healing will be difficult, and often the injury will not be fully healed.  And this nerve often shows itself to the senses; but if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and not visible, then it is necessary that you perform the phlebotomy with the instrument you use for phlebotomy with a cutting edge of steel and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you make the incision along the vein's length.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for illnesses of the eyes.
And in this case, if you want to perform phlebotomy, use an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped lancet; for it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, in some men, a boil is easily formed if it is not lanced on the first attempt, yet you should not do anything about that abscess.
The first thing to know is that phlebotomy is administered for the preservation of health, with hope and caution for the prevention of illness, and it should be performed on one of the veins in the arm, that is: cephalic, basilic, and median cubital veins.  Phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, after fasting in spring and autumn, and in winter shortly after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day or as soon as three hours have passed.
But phlebotomy, when administered due to necessity and appropriateness, can be done at any time, night or day.
And children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and pregnant women should not be bled until the fourth to seventh month, and the elderly, who have already passed sixty years, should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled in any way, they should cleanse their bowels beforehand with a leaven clyster, if they have much retained filth, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the bowels, which are impure, and that they do not harm the principal limbs.
And patients suffering from nausea, vomiting, or indigestion, or recovering from illness or drunkenness, should not be bled until this is resolved.  Nor should patients with dropsy be bled.  Moreover, phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, bowel issues, increased sexual activity, labor, exercise, fasting, or vigils, or any cause that weakens the body or spirit.
And consider, beforehand, the constitution of the humors, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if possible in that case.
And if no cause forbids it, bathe, or exercise, so that the blood might be refined.
And perform the phlebotomy on them in the morning, around the third hour (of the day), as we have said.
Ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful animalistic influences, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all bodily ailments, such as excessive work, pain, sexual activity, and similar things.
And have present at their bedside things used customarily by men, with aromatics and scents, and balsams and similar things, according to the possible quantity.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion of the one who is to be bled.
Then, gently pull the arm and rub it with the phlebotomist's hand two or three times; and then bind the limb with a bandage, wrapping it twice.
Let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not severe, or if the constriction is with excess, then prevent the flow of blood; or if it is with softening, then prevent the blood from flowing easily.
And then, with the constriction, it is necessary that the person to be bled rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and are apparent to the touch.
Then the phlebotomist anoints his lancet with a little old oil, specifically; and then places his left index finger on the vein, below the site where he wants to make the incision, so that the vein bulges slightly, and the pulsation ceases, for of the veins it is the one that you find thus, like a fleeing cord away from the incision, and of those is one that is full of air and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts toward the incision and the phlebotomist is informed; and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does, that one is tight.
Therefore, for this reason, the phlebotomist needs to be careful and attentive to all these points.
And then, apply the lancet again; but if the vein is opened in one attempt, it is good; and if not, you repeat this again a little below that spot, or above it with haste, if the spot isn't suppurating.
And if the spot is suppurating, or the patient is frightened, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not bind the limb tightly, for that will cause a very hot abscess, nor should they enter a bath.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out as desired, then you repeat the phlebotomy at that same point, slightly adjusting the opening, and do this quickly before the spot becomes inflamed, for many people develop an inflammation from a small opening.
But if that spot is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure on it, for it will not benefit you in any way; and put some oil-soaked linen on that spot, for it relieves the body of the blood. And it is better in this case than other oils.
And similarly, apply linen soaked in oil to any phlebotomy site.  This is done for veins that are obstructing blood flow, and practitioners use theriac, alhefadoc, and sagzenea (presumably ingredients/remedies) when these are placed on the site. This is because the blood is refined and flows better when it is diluted/made less thick.
And if a large abscess is formed at the phlebotomy site, as often happens, especially in those who have not been bled before or where the vein opening is small, then you should apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the affected area and firmly compress it for an hour, for this will help dissolve it.
And it is necessary to do this near the site where the blood is leaving the vein, by means of its own flow or another vein's.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the area for a few days, do not be concerned.  If desired, apply something containing aloe and myrrh (dissolved/mixed), or something like mint or balm extract to the area.
And many times abscesses and swellings occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And therefore, place your hand upon it, and if you then find softness under your pressure, then that swelling is harmful and bad; and then be careful to place upon it something like what we have mentioned, for blood will easily flow from the artery.
Make a poultice with something astringent, so that the area is hardened, and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
It is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their constitution and according to the color of the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is dark, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you find it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is diminished.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one session, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the incision be broad.
And in someone who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood in several sessions, and the incision should be narrow.
The best method in vein bloodletting is a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safer from blood flow and nerve damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the length or width of the vein.
And to whom fainting is prone following bloodletting, you should treat this beforehand with a small piece of bread infused in wine of pomegranate or simple oxymel heated; and take out a small amount of blood in three or four sessions.
And if there is a coldness of constitution, then before bloodletting, let him take bread infused in myrrh syrup or honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar, or a highly fragrant aromatic syrup.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is caused by the outflow of much blood, then he should drink water of flesh and a very fragrant, subtle syrup; and use aromatic substances with camphor, and let his feet be soothed with it.
And use the other remedies mentioned in the section on fainting from evacuation.
And whoever wants to improve their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, needs someone for whom bloodletting is a substantial evacuation, and its virtue is slow, to evacuate the blood little by little, according to the amount of virtue in the continuing days.
But if someone wants to improve their arm, and expel their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But if someone wants to draw the blood of their body to the opposite side of the part to which it inclines, it should be improved on the second or third day.
However, in a body where much blood is already heated and is inflamed and causing a fever, the blood must be expelled in one go, a large quantity should be expelled, and the procedure should be amplified until fainting occurs, provided that all the conditions of bloodletting have been observed; and you must place your hand on the pulse of the patient's body to regulate the blood flow so that death occurs instead of fainting, for this often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not appropriate, when you want to improve the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, if the vein opening is already closed and the blood flow is difficult, that you press upon it with force and the limb is stretched slightly, for that is very bad.
Leave it until it has been blood-let a second time; or remove the inflammation of the blood clot from the vein opening; or apply theriac, alfarach, or sagzenea and compress it gently until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed from that spot or the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called the "cord of the arm" is bled in place of the cephalic or basilic, when these are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of those veins.
And the quality of bleeding him is that the patient immerse his hand in warm water until the vein becomes red and clearly visible.
And then tie it tightly with a moderate ligature; and then bleed along the small transverse vein, not longitudinally or laterally.
And if the opening is wide, make your incision with the lancet just a little above the wrist joint.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you repeat the process of immersing the hand in warm water and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your desired outcome.
However, if you are during the summer months, then you are excused from the process of immersing the hand in warm water, and during winter months the body of the patient is placed in warm water.
And bleeding from this vein is safer than from any other vein, because below it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerve.
And bleeding from the vein of the right wrist is beneficial for illnesses of the liver.
And the technique of bleeding from that vein is that you hold the hand firmly with a bandage or your hand, after placing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then bleed across that vein; and if you cut it all the way through, that will not harm anything.
And be careful not to extend your incision too far with the phlebotomy, because below it are the nerves of the fingers, exposed (bare of flesh).
And then return the hand to the warm water and allow the blood to flow, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be prevented.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the necessary quantity, then apply oil and salt to the vein so that it doesn't close up quickly; and similarly, you should do this at every incision point.
However, the benefit of bloodletting from the left hand is that it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen.
And do the same in the bloodletting of him/her as you did on the other (hand/arm).
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for illnesses located in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.
And the procedure for bloodletting from him/her is that the patient should immerse their foot in warm water and apply friction until the veins appear clearly; and tie the area around the ankle with a strap; and the location of the vein, visible just below the toe, has many branches radiating out across the foot's surface.
And therefore, bloodlet the widest branch, either below the leg towards the heel or near the ankle, because it is better and more beneficial.
And if you are bloodletting on the surface of the foot, then you must be careful of the nerves that are beneath it on the foot's surface, and perform your bloodletting across the vein, as if you were cutting it.
And let the bloodletting be done skillfully.
However, if the escape of blood is prohibited, then you should repeatedly immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow out until it is evacuated.
And if the bloodletter errs the first time, then repeat the bloodletting slightly higher up, because the spot is healthier; and do not fear harming the patient, but be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly, do the same to the sole of the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, beneath the bone of the outer side.
And the benefit of bloodletting in this case, when it is due to hot blood, is relief from hip pain.
And the procedure for bloodletting in this case is that the patient enters a bath, and tightly wraps the thigh from the groin area up to above the heel with a long, thin bandage for four days, because it is only visible through this.
And therefore, when it appears, then you perform the bloodletting, according to each method available to you and along the vein—and that is better—either by incision or by section, because the area is inflamed.
And it is often deeply hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it doesn't appear to the touch, then bloodlet a branch of it, which is the one that appears on the back of the foot between the said auricular and anular [tendons/areas].
And be careful of the nerves, and let the blood flow out in the amount you want.
And then loosen the constriction and place a cloth over the bloodletting site and compress the area, for it will quickly heal.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping vessels are made of horns, or of earthenware, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with incision and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cupping with incision and blood extraction, there are fourteen locations on the body.  One is at the nape of the neck, the back part of the head; and one in the middle of the two sides of the neck together; and cupping on the chin below the jaw, further down from the mouth; and cupping on both shoulder blades; and cupping on the elbow, and it is on the end of the forearm; and cupping on the two forearms; and cupping on both sides of the chest; and cupping on both thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood from only the large veins, but from the small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and thus does not weaken the body as much as bloodletting, nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by fullness until the whole body has been emptied.
However, if necessity compels cupping for illness or for a chronic condition, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, in the middle of the month, or at any time.
And therefore, when any of these conditions occur, especially if it is in the middle or third of the month, then we command cupping to be performed after two or three hours have passed.
Cupping the neck is helpful when it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is clouded in the eyes, but this should be done after emptying the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advised to use it for those with cold conditions, or those with a cold, as it gives them great harm.
And therefore, it is not suitable for use on the elderly, or those with cold illnesses in their heads.
But for those on whom it is continuously used, numbness is caused;  and therefore you should instruct the cupper to gently move the cup slightly downward in parts, to prevent the generation of numbness.
But cupping with alcohol is in place of phlebotomy of the deep vein (vena fusca) and the basilica vein: and thus it is beneficial for asthma, and for constriction of the chest, and for splitting of the chest, and for coughs, and for congestion.
And the alcohol cupping should be gently raised, for if it is positioned too low, it generates weakness in the body and the stomach.
And cupping with Alhagdahan (a type of cupping) is beneficial for accidental head pains and for ophthalmia, and migraine, and fever, and for toothache; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press too hard with the scarification, so as not to cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth, and for gum decay, and for similar ailments in the mouth, and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the veins that are in both lips.
But cupping done above the two shoulder blades is beneficial for heatstroke, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on both sides within the armpits is helpful as a substitute for phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilica, the cephalic, and the basilic veins, for it draws blood from all the smaller veins within the flesh, and those smaller veins draw from the larger ones until the drawing is directed toward the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply with the scarification, for the area is lacking flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping treatment applied to the buttocks is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers located further down.
And you should instruct the cupper to use a large, bronze cupping glass, for the area needs a strong suction;  and delicate, thin cupping glasses are easily broken and should be avoided, along with excessive scarification.
However, cupping of the legs should be done with careful consideration, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are beneficial for long-standing pain in the kidneys and bladder; they induce menstruation, and are helpful for fever and inflammation; they are a substitute for bloodletting from two arms, and in that case, two fingers or two tubes.
However, they significantly weaken the whole body and can cause fainting in many people.
And the benefit of cupping in this instance is comparable to the benefit of cupping both legs.
And the proper method for applying cupping is to initially place an empty cupping glass and gently draw the suction, and do not prolong the cupping, but instead place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors may gather to the spot through natural accumulation. And do not cease repeating this and continuing until the area appears reddened and swollen and the redness of the blood is visible.
And then you make incisions and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the condition of the body's disposition.
For a person with delicate skin and prone to bruising, you should only incise once, so that the area is not ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the incision slightly, and to moderate the suction gently.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to incise twice, because on the first occasion the path for thinning the blood and its watery components is opened. But on the second, the scrutiny gained from the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made to achieve the final result.
And finally, when we want to extract blood slowly or a little bit, a single incision is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make deep incisions.
And the depth of the incision should be just the thickness of the blade.
If the skin where the cupping is to be applied is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, the sites for the cups should be anointed with soothing, opening, and resolving oils.  If it's summer, use almond oil, violet oil, mild rose oil, or chamomile oil; if it's winter, use narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or bloodroot oil, and similar remedies.
And if the excess is thick and cold, the oil should be of amaranth, balm, almond, or fennel, and similar ones.
But if the patient has wide pores and soft skin, the use of oil should be avoided.  Instead, the sites for the cupping should be washed with water or cool water from the sorrel plant, or with water from the pomegranate, or with water from the wild lettuce, and similar liquids.
And for those whose blood is excessively moist, wash their cups with sour wine, or with water mixed with myrtle and sumac, and similar remedies.
And for those with thick superfluities, wash their cups with old wine, or with water from yarrow, or a decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar remedies.
And the cupping should be avoided before a bath;  it should be administered shortly after the bath, for an hour or two, and the patient should rest after the cupping.
What is it that should be governed (or controlled) in the ventosation or bloodletting before the cupping?
One must consider at the outset: if the person being cupped or bled is choleric, and has hot blood and inflammation, then they should take cooling things, such as  milfoil (or possibly mugwort) infused in vinegar, endive, lettuce, secanabin, and similar cooling drinks (juices or infusions).
And give them foods such as poultry, and the flesh of birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and similar things.
And for those with a cold constitution, they should drink syrup of almug, or syrup of alsecanabin, or of seeds, and sumac, and a light-smelling wine between new and old;  they should be advised to consume little food and drink, and their diet should be limited to foods like poultry, hempseed, small birds, and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more substantial than the food.
And it is necessary to give certain people, at certain times, theriac, or medications containing musk (or musk-scented things), or alchelite, before cupping or bloodletting or shortly afterwards, so that the principal limbs are strengthened and the blood is refined; and they should not take them hot.
However, cupping without incision should be placed over the liver, spleen, gout, navel, and the joints of the knees and the side of the hips, for these limbs cannot tolerate incision upon them.
And this is not desired for drawing blood from a limb, but rather for drawing blood away from the limb, just as we place a cupping glass over the nipple during a bleeding from the nose; and we use it so that a cold, viscous wind trapped in the limb is dissolved, just as we place it on the abdomen and navel; for that method thins the limb, warms it, and relieves the pain by resolving the wind.
And it has already been placed on the ribs when there is a blockage or congestion in them, for through the power of strong suction it easily breaks up the blockage and eradicates the congestion from its place.
And similarly, it works when placed on the liver and spleen to remove wind trapped within them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty, with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and larger, either with warm water alone, or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass administered with fire:  The width of the opening should be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and the amount of the opening should be half a palm; and it should be on its side, in the location in the circumference, half of it, the hole should be small enough that a needle can barely enter it.
It should be made of red or citrus wood, with thick edges, lion, oak, and other hardwoods so that it does not damage the limb when placed on it.
And there should be a transverse rod of wood or iron in the middle, upon which the candle with the fire is placed.
And this cupping glass should be significantly larger than the one previously described; and the smaller one should be smaller, according to the illness and the age of the person using it.
And the cupping glasses for children and the weak are different from the cupping glasses for young people and those with strong bodies.
And the way to place this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to heat the cupping glass with a decent fire of wood before a small candle of wax, and place that on the middle of the transverse rod in the center of the cupping glass, so that the fire is kindled around the lower part, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be placed over the hole we mentioned, until when we have applied the cupping glasses and don't want the finger to be exposed and the vapor to escape through that hole, the cupping glass will quickly be dissolved.
And heat the cupping glass according to its method, and repeat as needed.
But a cupping glass used in a pleurisy ailment, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or hole, is administered only by filling it with water and placing it directly on the limb.
And this is its form:  And the larger this cupping glass is, the better, because it can receive a larger quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where the application of cupping glasses is not possible due to their small size, such as the feet and gums, and similar parts; or to a limb devoid of flesh, such as the penis and nose, and parts similar to them.
And the quality of using those leeches is that you should find them in clean, clear, spring water.
And then they should be left in clean water during the day and night until they are hungry and no residue remains in their stomachs;  and then the body should be emptied at the outset by bloodletting and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it becomes red; and then the leeches should be placed upon it.
And when they are full and drop off.
And if suction of the area is possible with a cupping glass, it is better still for treatment.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged around the attachment of the leeches, and if it is oozing, then you soak a cloth in cold water and place it over it until the oozing stops.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle crushed vitriol, or other similar styptic substances, upon it until the blood is stopped; or place the roasted halves of beans on the area, and leave them until the beans adhere to the area, and the blood will stop.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, when possible changing them.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being used, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood flows; and then place them, for when they sense blood, they will immediately attach.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle a little crushed alum, or salt, or ash, on them, and they will detach immediately.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of the bones that occur by accident.
O, son, know that foolish and common physicians, and those who have never studied the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them, boast of this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of learned men in our land is hidden; and I have not forgotten any of it, nor have I embraced it hastily.  Instead, I have acquired it through the lengthy study of ancient books and the intense examination of their understanding, until I extracted this knowledge from them.
And subsequently I have applied myself to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that my knowledge contains and upon which my experience has been applied; since I have abridged this for you and freed it from lengthy explanations; and I have condensed it to the very end of the summary; and I have shown it at the conclusion of the explanation; and I have presented various forms of the instruments used in it, as is done by adding explanations, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
A summary and collection of the essential elements of bone fractures, before we begin to discuss the repair of fractured limbs and their various types. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with a summary of the subject matter; and the chapters, which the craftsman must understand at the beginning and stand upon the truth of these, that is, you and those who are eager to learn or learn this noble art from you.
Therefore, I say that when a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or fall occurs, then you should begin with phlebotomy or alleviation, or both together, if no reason prevents it, such as weakness of constitution, or if the victim is a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or if the time is one of extreme heat or extreme cold.
And afterward, let his diet consist of cool herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and avoid fatty meats and foods that fill the veins with blood, until you are certain of a healthy abscess and if you do not fear the outflow of matter to the limb.
And then, restore the patient to his former regimen, with which he is accustomed.
And therefore, when the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nourishing foods, substantial and heavy, which have viscosity, such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and porridge, and calves' feet and belly, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar to these, and with this regimen, the fracture is more easily and better coagulated.
And know that broken bones in those who are in the prime of life and in the aged, cannot be joined and consolidated according to their nature because of the wasting of their limbs.
But nevertheless, nature joins and brings together over the broken bone some substance similar to glue, which is thick and adheres to and tightens it until it is completely glued and bound together, until it reaches the point of strength and firmness, like a fire at the beginning, until nothing hinders it from its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient eats foods that are heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and the fracture of the foot bone is different from the fracture of the arm bone; and similarly, all the other limbs are different from each other.
And I come with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is diverse types of fractures within themselves. And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for there is a curved fracture, and those that occur in a star-like pattern; and sometimes a fracture runs along the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the bone, jagged, and splintered, and compound and incomplete, just as happens when a writing pen is prepared, and there is a fracture with a break and a crack in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for every type, there is a particular method or treatment for restoring it, according to the distinct memory of it in its proper places.
Various signs of bone fracture. And by these things is a bone fracture known:  its twisting, and the prominence and appearance of it to the sense, and that of it when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor is it made apparent by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation and the patient does not experience great pain, then there is no fracture.
However, it is possible there might be a twisting or small crack, so you should not waste your effort pressing on it with your hand and a full compression.  Instead, put on some of the medicines that bring memory to that moment, which are suited to that place, and then carefully bind it with a subtle bandage.
And know that when the place is bent but not split in two, or otherwise damaged in its arrangement, and when all parts of it remain in their position, then it is necessary for you to begin straightening it immediately, for fear of a harmful abscess occurring there.
And if an abscess forms there, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then heal it in any way you can with gentleness and ingenuity.
And know that restoring and healing the soft tissues is easier than the bone in which damage has occurred.
And then strengthen it according to the memory of the method.
But if the bone is damaged, then it is necessary to extend that broken limb in two parts, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords, or with one cord and the hand.
And be careful in positioning the limb back in its natural shape, while the broken limb parts are extended, then you must make every effort to return those additions to their proper places with ingenuity and in any way you can.
And guard yourself from causing further pain or injury to the patient during your treatment; and endeavor, using your skill, to apply one bone to its corresponding partner according to their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch that [bone] with your hand, and if you find any other reason, then correct that and make it even according to your skill.
Avoid excessive stretching and compression, as some foolish doctors, who often cause abscesses and contractions in the limb through their treatment, have been observed to do.
The type of binding for the immobilized limb is what I recommend; so that you understand that broken limbs vary in their smallness and largeness and in their shape.
And for those that are small, such as the arm, finger, or foot, and similar parts, then the wrapping should be of a thin, soft cloth.
However, for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, a strong and firm wrapping is needed, for a firm bandage connects the large limb, tightening it all around, so that no gap remains.
And then, proceed with applying suitable bandages to the fracture site, using three or four wraps, depending on the limb's needs; and slightly tighten the bandage with your hand.
And then move to the highest part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did at the fracture site. And then slowly loosen the wrapping of the fracture site, gradually relaxing the tightening, until you have pulled a significant part of the limb back into place.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken area with a wrap, and then move the wraps to the lowest part of the fracture; and your procedure should consist of tightening the bandage and loosening it, following the method described for the first wrap above.
And then place between the wraps a pad of linen or cloth to address any twisting of the fracture, if there is any twisting; otherwise, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over these carefully applied wraps, if there is no inflammation or festering sore in the area; otherwise, apply something to soothe the sore and reduce the swelling; leave that on for several days; and then tighten the wraps over that.
And the splints should be made from half of a sturdy, well-shaped branch, or of pinewood, or palm fronds; and the width of each splint should be in this shape and form:
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly larger and wider than the others, and the splint's length should match the limb's size; and then tighten the splints with another bandage according to your initial tightening; and then tie it securely above that, as previously described for tightening, and your tightening should be firmer closer to the fracture site, and the further you move from the fracture, the looser the tightening should be.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and made of linen; and if the threads are too thick, as I have seen some foolish surgeons use, using ropes or thick twisted threads, that is a big error, as the tightening will lack uniformity.
And similarly, very thin threads are not suitable, because you will not be able to tighten them as you would like, and there should be at least a finger's width between the splints.
And if the patient is irritated by the edges of the splints near the tightening, at the affected areas, then put some soft material like wool or soft linen under them, to prevent injury.
Sometimes the fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption of the continuity occurs; and I will discuss that in more detail in the second chapter.
And know that not every broken limb should be fastened with splints on the first day; for, if the limb is large, you should not apply splints until perhaps 3, 5, or more days have passed, depending on your judgment about the possibility of a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters with which the ancients treated fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A common method of plaster for fracture repair, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it neither causes heat nor cold: take powdered flour, specifically the fine flour that collects on the inside walls of the mill after grinding.
And prepare it just as it is, but sift it with egg white, and make a paste of it that is neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster for treating fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take asafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and wild carrot root (which is the herb called "mignar"), all 1/4 ounce each.  Myrrh and aloe, 1/8 ounce each; aloes, 1/2 ounce; all ground and sifted, and mixed with warm water or egg white if the patient's constitution is heated. Then use this plaster, for it is a good composition, healing slight fractures, and beneficial to many people.
Another method of plaster, useful for fractures and sprains: take wild carrot (migrach) and white marshmallow root, 1/4 ounce each; myrrh and aloe, 1/8 ounce each; acacia, 1/6 ounce; and Armenian bole, 1/2 ounce.
All are ground finely in a mortar, sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and for pain and cracks and fractures: take wool, soak it in sour wine and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoring, but rather provides a hot poultice to expel pain effectively.
Another method of plaster to restore a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy;  mix them together and make a plaster from them.
A quick plaster method, used for the restoration of broken bones and when you want to resolve remaining pus: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and yarrow flour, all in equal parts; grind all together and mix with wine, unless the affected area is inflamed.
However, if it is inflamed, then treat it with damp coriander water or water and use that.
Another, stronger plaster for resolving stubborn pus before the limb is restored: take roots of marshmallow, flax seeds, balms, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all in equal parts; grind everything together and mix with willow water, fresh water, or wine, depending on the limb's condition and the color of its complexion.
However, Hippocrates in his book does not say that a plaster should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration, but rather a cerot (plaster) made of wax and oil, and nothing else;  he recommends it to be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is seen that plasters are placed on the broken limb during restoration, and in cases where there is drying out with a little warmth, such as myrrh, incense, and similar substances to those we have mentioned.
A plaster for healing wounds and pain: take equal parts of crushed figs, human skin (or bird's skin), marshmallow, and salt; grind and sieve them, then mix to form a plaster.
However, regarding the amount of time the bandage should remain in place and when it should be removed, consider whether the injury causes pain, swelling or if the bone is broken and displaced.  If not, then you should not remove it for several days. And if the area experiences intense pain, swelling, or inflammation, then you should remove or loosen the bandage immediately and remove the plaster from the area.
And take a clean cloth and a wet sponge, soak it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the swelling subsides and the pain is eased.  Then, let the limb rest for an hour, and afterwards place a layer of wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rubbed oil on top, and bandage it for a night until you are certain of any heat or inflammation in the limb, and the pain is reduced.
Then apply a thin layer of this plaster again, and a small plaster, and do not apply the first constriction tightly; use a subtle approach until healed.
And if the abscess, stiffness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely subsided, and you no longer need the plaster and bandage, then you should reapply them in the same manner as you did initially.
And if no symptoms of those we have mentioned appear in the limb, then do not loosen the bandage for three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes this is left on for twenty days, as you deem suitable based on the healing of the limb, as we have described, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh around it consolidates.
Then, increase the tightness of the bandage more than in your initial application, and increase the patient's intake of nourishing food, according to the patient's recovery.
But if you find the fracture site is becoming too dry and weakened, more than is appropriate, know that nourishment will not reach it.  Therefore, moisten it with warm water every time you loosen the bandage, for three days.  Ease the bandage a little, and through this action, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
However, what those foolish healers do, restoring the fractured limb a second time when it was not properly restored at first, according to what is required, but rather restored in a crooked manner, is a mistake in their procedure, and great folly.  If they had done it correctly, the ancients in their writings would have explained it, and would have practiced it correctly.
And I have not seen any of them do this, which makes it more reasonable that it should not be done.
Second Chapter: Concerning fractures when they occur to the head.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their shapes are diverse, and their causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a blunt instrument, and the blow crushes the entire bone down to the skull, just as it does in a log, and thus this type is called a comminuted fracture; or the blunt instrument cuts a portion of the bone and cuts the flesh on it, and does not pass through to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called a simple fracture.
And the severity of these two fractures is either great or slight, and a fracture that is a crushing or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone or falling on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two fractures is either great or slight.
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the fineness of a small hair, and therefore this type is called a capillary fracture.
And a fracture is caused either by falling or by a blow from a stone, and similar things, that causes some plate of the bone to be driven inward, and is made in the hollow place, as happens to the ribs when they are struck, and part of their entrance is driven inward.
This is more common in the bones of moist bodies, such as the heads of infants.
And in all these types of fractures, the pieces are scattered, like separated stars. And I will come to restore all of that to its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing them, and by investigating them with probes and the removal of corrupted flesh that is on them.
A particular type is recognized because it is uncovered on the bone, and is cleaned and rubbed with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's symptoms.  Then, if you see symptoms that indicate significant danger, such as vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, swelling and stiffness of the limbs, and similar severe symptoms, the patient is in doubt, and will not likely recover.
And if you see less severe symptoms, you expect recovery, then you begin the treatment.
The reason for this is that if the afflicted person came to you at the beginning of the affliction, as in the winter months, you should consider removing the bone before the 14th day, according to the patient's condition.
And if it is during the summer months, then you should remove the bone before the 7th day, lest the area beneath the bone be corrupted by swelling, and the symptoms we have described occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the soft tissue covering the brain, and is with broken and crushed parts, then you should incise the broken and crushed parts, as I will explain to you.
And you should shave the head of the afflicted patient, and uncover the bone according to the custom and method appropriate to you, based on the nature of the affliction, and so that it is gentle on the patient.
And if you encounter bone exposure, blood flow, or a painful abscess, then you should oppose it with whatever is necessary, filling the area with cloths soaked in warmed wine and oil, and allowing the affliction to rest until the abscess subsides and the blood flow ceases; then begin with the cleaning of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow, sharp scalpel, and this is its form:  And then apply another scalpel, a little wider than the first; and this is its form:
And then apply a scalpel wider than the second one.
And it is necessary to have several different scalpels at your disposal, some wider than others; and some of them shorter than others, with sharpened edges, made of tempered iron or steel.
And use them with ease in striking the scalpel, so that you don't strike the head and damage it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to drill a hole around it before you apply the scalpels with the drills, which are called non-deepening drills.
And they are not named thus, except because they do not penetrate the bone's surface, as the drill's tip or edge that is below the pointed head is similar to a small edge or circle, which prevents submersion and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each appropriate to the thickness of each bone, so that you have on hand for every skull bone a drill tip that is sharp, its length and shortness adjusted to the thickness of that particular bone.
And this is the method for three types of drills:  To drill around a fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then change the drill to another location, and make a hole roughly the size of the ray's thickness or approximately that.
And then you make incisions with scalpels between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible, as we have said, until you have removed the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument you have prepared, such as fine pliers and forceps.
And you must be very careful that the scalpel does not touch any part of the skull.
And once you have drilled around the bone, and if it is still connected to the skull, you must remove it by scraping and smoothing the rough edges of the bone with another tool similar to a scalpel, but it must be thinner and finer than the other scalpels.
And if any small pieces of bone remain, then remove them easily with the tools you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is gentle, free of fear, which Gualo described and praised highly; and this is his teaching: It is necessary for you at the beginning to begin uncovering the part of the bone in the location of the most severe and obvious fracture, until when you have uncovered that part and have placed beneath it the tip of this slow and gentle scalpel, of which this is the shape:
And the lenticular part is blunt and does not cut anything, and the pointed part is on two sides, forward in length, like you see; so that the lenticular part is attached to the skull with the pointed cutting side against the bone.
And then strike the scalpel on one side with a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone with ease, as it has been turned; and you are certain of the skin that no accident will happen to it in any way. And if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he were asleep.
Then, if any cause remains attached to the bone of the skin in certain places of the bone, you will cut it with the tip of the lenticular scalpel, and will release it with ease, for it is released without harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the skin, and what is cut or removed from the bone is its surface, and it remains rough and with subtle irregularities, then it is necessary to smooth that roughness and remove those irregularities with thin razors, for which you have prepared various quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply the most suitable ones in every place and the most appropriate ones according to what you have in mind when you perform your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that in your procedure, with which you smooth the bone, you start with the widest of those razors, and then proceed to use the finest of them, and do not cease doing this successively until you come to using the finest and most subtle of all of them.
However, in each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, you must apply treatment according to what you perceive as necessary for their rectification.
And it is a cause not hidden from all those who have studied that art. And this, which we have written, demonstrates it in major fractures.
And if the pannicle is retracted when you reduce the bone, then you must take a cloth according to the size of the wound, immerse it in warmed oil, and place it over the wound's opening; then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and warmed oil, and place this on the first cloth, doing so as gently as possible, so as not to weigh down the wound; then apply a wide bandage over it, and do not tighten it more than is necessary to simply hold the wound closed.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of a hot abscess; then remove it and apply medicines that are effective against dryness, such as flax seeds, barley flour, ashes, and similar powders.
And you should make these medicines into a powder, pulverized and applied to the wound, just as they are dried; and universally, apply any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to irritate.
And be careful, according to your skill, that the wound, in your treatment, remains clean, and is not clogged with ointment or anything else; nor allow the wound to become infected with harmful substances, for when they are applied to the membranes of the brain they corrupt and pollute it, and bring upon the patient an extremely harmful illness.
And this can happen in the skull, especially when the treatment of the bone is neglected, and there is blackening on its surface; therefore, if you observe the symptoms we have mentioned, know that this is a serious illness without a doubt.
And if the darkening is not from the wound itself but from the medicine applied, and the medicine itself is causing the darkening, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rubbed olive oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, then place it on the skull; and then treat it with the appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in two parts simultaneously, but sometimes only in one.  This is because there are two bones in the nose; the lower part is cartilaginous and is not broken, but is only bruised, twisted, and deformed.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nose, and with your index finger press the fracture inward, and with your thumb outward, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this with ease, and be careful not to cause more pain to the patient with your procedure.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it must be set with the end of a tool with a small, rounded tip.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same.
And strive for a restoration within the first day of the fracture, if possible; if not, then approximately the 7th or 10th, you must apply a soothing poultice.
And approximately insert a piece of linen cloth into the nasal opening, if the fracture is in one part, or put two pads, if the fracture is in two parts, and the pad should have enough bulk to fill the nasal cavity.
And some of the ancient healers say the pads should be soaked in a broth and changed daily, but I do not find this necessary.  Instead, the cloth should be soaked in a mixture of beaten egg and powdered spice.  Then leave the pad in place until the bone is set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a pad, a bird's feather wrapped in linen is placed in the nose.  This is done when the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not prohibited from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; if you wish, use this, and if you wish, use pads.
And if there is an abscess again, apply a plaster to the nose made with cerot or cotton dipped in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
However, if there is no suppurating abscess, then you should cover the external part with flour, powdered incense mixed with egg white.  Then place a linen bandage over that, and do not bind the nose with anything else.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then you should cut around them and remove them with instruments suitable for this; then close the wound and treat it with things that promote healing and consolidation, and with appropriate plasters.
And if there is an ulcer inside the nose, then you should treat it with pads and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, then consider if the fracture is only outward, and not broken in two but bent inward at the edges, then its repositioning is easy.
And thus, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of your right hand; and push the bend of the fracture inward with ease towards the outside, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; with that, gently straighten it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply extension to both parts according to their alignment until their reunion is possible.
And if you encounter a loosening of teeth along with a breakage, then hold those you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; then place a poultice on the broken jaw, then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, properly made bandage or a piece of lead, equal to the length of the jaw; and then tie it on top as you have the means to do so, applying the bandage, until it is healed.
And order the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him easily digestible food.
And if you estimate that the shape has already been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen it on the third day; and then you should correct whatever has been altered, and plaster it with powdered moli, with egg white, or with flour of oats, after removing the poultice, and place a soft wool bandage over the plaster.
Then, when this plaster is properly applied and the bone's position isn't further altered, leave it, do not remove it until the fracture is healed and strong; for often this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a painful boil occurs, then administer what we have said many times for its reduction until it is healed, and the boil is resolved.
And if the fracture is with a plaque, then consider whether it is a piece of the bone separated or splinters; then carefully remove those splinters with whatever is appropriate for that in the removal of splinters from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with leeches according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing further remains, then you dress the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, apply one of the appropriate plasters to it and allow it to heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
Often the collarbone is fractured on the part in front of the muscle, and that fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is fractured, or separated, or separated into two parts without any splinters, its restoration is easy; or it is splintered and difficult to restore; or the fracture is with an open wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without an open wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds and steadies the fractured collarbone, and the other stretches the neck towards that area.
And then grasp the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correctly formed, and is neither too prominent nor concave.
And if you require more extension, then you should place under the patient's neck a pad of cloth or wool, sized according to your needs; and extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until you have correctly aligned the fracture.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone's end outward because it has adhered to the bone, then the patient should be placed supine on their neck, and you should place a cushion of medium size upon the patient's muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle below, so that the collarbone's bone is lifted away from the adhesion, and then you straighten the fracture and grasp it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone and they are loose, then you should cut around them and easily remove those splinters.
And if it is embedded in the bone, then you create an incision with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, having placed the instrument used for the chisel beneath the collarbone; and this instrument is made of wood or iron, of which this is its shape:
And it is similar to a scoop, whose concavity is this; and its width should be according to your needs, depending on the size of the bone or the little amount of it.
But its length should be according to what is possible for you in the operation; let it have two ends, like a wedge, and one end be wide and the other narrow.
And if the rupture of the wound you have incised when you have extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure of a hot abscess, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the rupture is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's cut.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in vinegar, and rubbed oil and wine, and place it on top.
And ensure that the splint does not move away from the broken bone.  Therefore, you should see the patient daily, and when you see that the ligament is softened or the splint has become loose, then you should rectify this and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's pillow on their neck, and place a small cushion under their armpit beneath the pillow at night.  This is so that the patient's shoulder is elevated from the side of the wound, and thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated from the muscle; or the patient's arm is tied to the neck.
Do not loosen the bandage unless there is a suppuration or abscess in the area, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the plaster if you see the patient's skin reacting to it, and adjust it around the fracture, and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle is restored and solidified.
And it is strengthened and comfortable within twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is completed in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a fractured shoulder.
The shoulder blade is fractured at a point lateral to it, and it is not fractured from the center, but from the edges.
And therefore, when the fracture is located — and it is fractured in the middle of it — and is only known by touch, then according to the nature of the fracture, prepare it and restore it to its natural form by any means possible.
Then place on the area powder of millstones mixed with egg white and stop it; and then place a folded cloth; and then place a thin sheet of lead over it, according to the size of the entire shoulder blade or a little more.
But if beneath the lead there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that hollow with plaster, and then raise the lead to an equal level.
And then press it (the lead) from above with a long, appropriate constriction and firm pressure on the lead until it is no longer displaced from its position.
And consider the ligature every day; and every time it is softened, bind it again and press it and re-position the lead if it has been displaced from its place.
And let the patient lie on their sound side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore, when this number of days has been completed, then you dissolve the ligature, and you must know for certain that it is from the bones from which the commencement is not feared, nor is their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the location of the weighty bone and place the splint underneath, then you cut it, remove it, and do as we said regarding the fracture of the furcula, for the treatment of an abscess, if this is the case here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this is less serious; but its extremities are often more seriously torn and crushed.
And the symptoms when the middle of the foot is broken include:  deviation of the parts inwards, great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, considerable weakness, and vomiting blood; and the broken bone cavity is apparent and not hidden from feeling.
And the restoration of it is that the patient be placed on their back, and a cushion be placed between their shoulder blades;  then firmly press on the muscles, and join the bones together with both hands, being meticulous in the procedure and adjusting according to every possible method and what is appropriate, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then apply a poultice and bandage, and place a thin layer of willow or fig bark, or something similar in lightness, on top of it, and wrap this in cloth.  Then carefully bind this around the broken bone so it doesn't move; and occasionally bind it in a circular fashion around the back, and tightly bandage it in a suitable manner; and regularly check the bandage, and when it is softened, tighten it.
And if the bandage causes irritation, or swelling, or pain, or an abscess in the area, then you must loosen it and remove the poultice and rectify what has happened by a suitable treatment; and then replace the poultice, if it is appropriate for the condition; and maintain the bandage until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of broken bones.
Know that fractures of the ribs occur only in the thick parts, which are the two sides; and the extremities and front portion are not usually affected by injuries because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the feeling, through the investigation of it with words.
And the restoration should be such that the fracture is held together with words according to the best possible method, until it is properly joined, and then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.
And if the rib fracture is in the inner parts, then the patient experiences intense pain and stabbing, like the pain of someone with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and there is difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
And already the ancients were ingenious in dealing with this with great skill.
And according to them, one should avoid foods that cause inflammation and gas, so that the stomach does not become bloated and distended, and the fracture is not pushed outwards.
But we should consider this, so that it is not an easy cause to generate a hot abscess, if it does not happen; and if it does happen, then it will help with that.
And some of them would say that a cupping glass should be placed on it, and then suction should be made strongly; and it seems like a reasonable approach, but nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the area because of the weakness.
And some of them would say: the area should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is full, so that the dressing fits tightly when wrapped around the affected area; then the patient should be treated with a pleurisy-like diet and medicine.
And if a violent cause afflicts the patient, whom it cannot withstand, and the bone pierces the covering with a painful puncture, causing us concern about the patient, then we must make an incision over the area, expose the fractured rib, and then place an instrument on it to preserve the shape of the rib, the remembrance of which is prior, and to cut the bone with ease, and remove it.
And then, if the wound is large, we should bring the two sides of the wound together with stitches, and treat it with poultices until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should mix powders in rubbed oil and apply it to the area, and the patient should be treated with whatever is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of fractures of the spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and often in their articulation, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if you find their muscles already softened, numb, dead, and you can neither move nor stretch nor compress them, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle, they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed, and in such a state of disposition, death is imminent.
And if you move them and feel constriction with your fingers and pricks, then know that the bone's integrity is preserved and the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar things to this in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you see that the feet are also softened, as was the case with the muscles, and further, when the patient lies on their back, they experience involuntary emptying and expulsion, and sometimes they are lying on their back, attempting to urinate but cannot, then know that this is fatal, and you should not expend effort on their cure.
But if you observe none of those symptoms, the cause is milder and more easily dealt with.
And the cure for this is to apply soothing compresses of hot oil or crushed egg yolks to the inflamed vertebra.  Apply these dressings several times a day until the inflammatory abscess subsides.
And then apply a soothing and stimulating plaster, and bind it firmly.  Instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not to sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you observe evidence of bone fracture, or any other cause that has separated the bone from its place, then it is necessary to cut away the surrounding tissue and remove the bone.  Then carefully rejoin the two sides of the wound, with sutures if it is a large fracture.  Then treat the area with a flesh-promoting ointment until it heals.
But if the back of the bone is fractured, and the hip joint is affected, then you must insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and use the other hand to align the broken bone as best as possible using a second method; then apply a plaster and bandages, if needed, and bind the area firmly.
And if you find broken fragments of bone there, then carefully remove them, and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the [broken] hip.
The bones of the hip joint are often broken, and if they break, the fracture is usually only a separation of the extremities, they are split lengthwise and shifted out of alignment.  The patient experiences pain and throbbing at the affected area, and the leg becomes numb when fractured.
And the restoration involves you placing your hand over it [the fractured area] until it is positioned correctly, according to the correct anatomical alignment.
And if the fracture is only on one extremity, then you must align it using whatever means are available, until it is properly aligned with its natural position.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or has already shifted downward, then you must have the patient lie on their stomach until you are prepared to restore that fracture. And once you have aligned it, apply a plaster to it, then place a splint of wood or bone on top, and secure it tightly, so that you don't worry about the puncture of the fracture or the splint moving.
And align the concave area with whatever fills it properly until it meets the straight area, and tell the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
However, if a painful abscess arises, then cease treating the patient's condition and restoring it until the painful abscess is subsided, and apply what reduces it according to what is done beforehand; and then return to the treatment, and secure it properly.
And if the bones are shattered or splintered, then you should remove them.
Chapter 11.
Of restoring the fracture of the arm/forearm.
Adjutori" is what is between the elbow and the end of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness according to this form:
And two ligaments are tied to its two ends, and it is then suspended from a high place.
And have the patient lie down on a bed; then gently place the patient's broken arm on the wood until its end reaches the middle point of the wood, to which the curve of the arm is attached.
And then suspend a heavy object over it, or the attendant should extend the wood downwards; and then the doctor and the patient's hands together should hold the fracture until it returns to its proper place.
The other way is for the patient to be lying on their back, and to tie the patient's arm to a support; then instruct two attendants to hold one of them on the area above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold the lower part; and each should extend it in their respective direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tie a bandage around the fracture and another bandage over that, and each of the two assistants extend in their respective directions.
And thus, if the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then it is necessary to place half of the bandage on the end and the other below the fracture, towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary to place the bandage over that spot and over the elbow.
Apply that easily and without effort, and then, when it is fastened as needed and applied with good application, tie it firmly to prevent a suppurating boil.
But if a suppurating boil occurs, then leave the bandage until the seventh day, and place on it wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil until the boil subsides, and then you tie it.
And the way to tie it is to place a plaster over the fracture, then place a wrapping of clean cloth over the plaster; then adjust the arm on this support, and place their open hand over their muscle.
And place the cloth and tie it to the support, so the arm is in the proper position, if no cause from the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And you should place on the fracture the splint that is widest and strongest of the other splints; and place the width of a finger between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tie the splints together with the binding I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your binding over the fracture site is tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the binding should be.
So, adjust the positioning of the splints and the binding as we described when you restore the limb to its proper place, then do [the following].
And if you fear a suppurative abscess, then leave the binding and splints in place for seven days, as we have stated.
And thereafter, monitor the ligament in all its parts for three days, so that no bruising or inflammation occurs.  Or, the limb should not receive food to prevent excess swelling from the binding.  Thus, correct everything according to what we have said.
However, if you are confident that no cause for this will occur, then do not loosen the bandage until after three days, or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, with their hands on their stomach.
And place a full, wool-stuffed cushion under the affected area.  And at all hours of night or day, be sure the shape of the broken limb is not distorted, or the ligament softened, then correct all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we previously mentioned, so that the food is light at first until it has begun to be stronger; and then you must increase the food's quantity.
Because according to custom, the splint and leg should remain in place for forty days; and then they must be released, and a bath administered, and medicated with ointments that correct the affected area.
And if the fracture is severely inflamed, then do not release the ligament and splints for up to a month or up to two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called two "foils"; of which one is small, and it is the one that sits on the said finger, and the other is large and is the one that rests beneath the small finger, on the lower part.
And often the larger foil is broken alone, or the smaller one, and often they are broken together.
And when the small foil is broken above, then the restoration of it is easier, and its healing is more straightforward.
And when the foil is broken below, the fracture is serious, and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when the two bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the broken bone is the small foil above, then it is appropriate for the physician, in order to restore it, to gently apply a small extension until it is set.
But if the large foil is broken, then a more forceful extension is necessary.
And if both foils are broken together, then you must apply the pressure much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the hand's form to assist its restoration and extension, placed over a cushion, and let the thumb be positioned higher than all the other fingers, the said little finger be lower than the others, and the patient be lying on a smooth, flat surface.
And there should be a cushion in front of him, at his height or level, so that the patient does not experience discomfort.
And then the attendant stretches the arm of the lower part with their hand or a bandage, and another attendant stretches the upper part similarly.
And then the physician pushes the bone back in until it is reduced to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are difficulties, then you must exert yourself to restore each piece to its proper place with your skill.
And if there appears a separated fragment that pierces the skin and is not to your satisfaction in restoring it, then you should sew it up and close it according to the method previously mentioned.
But if the fracture is with pus, I have already made a separate chapter on this, and therefore take care of that accordingly.
And if you encounter a suppurating abscess at the start of your restoration, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of roasted oil and white wax, and let it be of medium consistency and subtlety, and tightly bind the cloth over that until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a prepared plaster of powdered mortar with egg white, and then apply bandages; and let the bandage be placed over that pus-filled and sore fracture.
And know that the name of the bandages for the arm is used in the major arrangements, or whether the fracture is in one compartment or in two compartments at once.
Then apply your bandage firmly and forcefully to the fracture site, and if the bandage is placed on the parts above the fracture or on the lower parts, apply it slightly more loosely according to what was previously mentioned in the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is bound should be of a medium consistency between subtle and coarse, as we have described.
And consider the limb and its ligaments for a few days. And if any cause arises for which rectification is necessary, such as swelling of the limb, then you must immerse the limb in hot water until the swelling ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the constriction is now softened and the bone is realigned and similar to the others, then rectify all of this with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excess constriction, for then it is necessary to soften that slightly and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to loosen it for about twenty days or thereabouts.
And then, using your skill, suspend the patient's arm with the aid of active movement, and have them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 or 32 days, or more quickly in 28 days, and all of this depends on the disposition of the complexions and the efficacy of the treatment.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand's wrist and fingers.
Know that the wrist of the hand and the joints of the fingers are frequently fractured, and often, the damage is due to friction rather than impact.
And when the hand suffers a fracture or injury, the patient should lie down, and the hand should be placed on a surface that is even, and then the patient's hand should be placed upon that extended hand.
Then the attendant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should hold them together until they are properly joined.
Then a plaster and bandage are needed, if there is no risk of an abscess; and a splint is placed on top, corresponding to the injured area.  You have now wrapped it in a cloth.
However, if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, then make a shape like a cloth sling, and instruct the patient to press that with their fractured palm; then it should be secured with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather, with a cloth in which it is placed so the leather is applied to the palm; and press it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a splint on top and another splint from the part below the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the bandage, as if the hand is twisted to the wrist between the fingers with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs to any of the joints of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be encased as needed and then be held in place by the palm.  If desired, place a small, straight splint on it to keep the fracture elevated and prevent it from moving.
However, if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, ring finger, or pinky finger, then it should be encased and bound with the finger next to it; or all fingers should be bound together consecutively, which is better; or place a small splint on it, just as we have described for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and after that, the disposition of a hot abscess and its opposite—with your operation—with what is necessary when any of those causes occur, according to how it has been repeated in the account.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken, and it is diagnosed by feeling according to whether it is displaced forward and most severely.
And its restoration is done by tightening a ligament over the fracture and another ligament under the fracture, and the patient is laid prone on their stomach and on their face.
And then the physician stretches all the ligament to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be close to the knee, toward the hip joint, so that the extension is sufficient; and another ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is near the knee, then the ligament should be placed near the knee, and the extension should be directed towards the lower parts.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both of their hands until it is restored to its natural shape and the bone is properly joined; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, lest the limb be afflicted with an abscess. But if it becomes infected with an abscess, then you leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied thus:  wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, fold it two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, in the lower regions, and let the ends of the splint extend from the superior part of the two sections, and then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place splints on the thigh, over the fractured area, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is stabilized.
And then apply a strong bandage around the center of the fracture area with three or four wraps; the further you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the weaker and lighter and more loose the bandage should become.
And then extend the two ends of the splint to the lower parts until they reach the ankle of the foot, and firmly hold the ends of the splints on the other side to ensure the bandage remains in its place.
And then leave the bandage on it, so that no swelling, abscess, heat, or inflammation, and similar things, befall the limb; and if any of these afflictions occur, then remove it immediately, and correct whatever has happened as soon as possible, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding, then you must reduce that as much as possible; and if not, cover it and leave it, and treat it with what has preceded the remedy until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh, or other things that are bound to it, are splinted, as we have said in the section on the arm/leg.
However, in a restoration done in this way, the patient does not experience lameness; and if it is restored alone, or otherwise another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that that person limps, as is customary.
And know that the thigh is splinted for 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all this is according to the diversity of the constitutions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Know that a fractured kneecap often heals, but often results in a lot of friction.
However, if a fracture occurs, it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a bruise, and about that, everything is established by feeling.
And the restoration of it is done so that what is broken from its parts is joined together with these things until it is joined and connected as much as possible by matching, ease, and shaping.
And then place a plaster and put it on that round shape, if you need one; and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the methods that we have described for other fractures, just as for a boil, or anything similar that opposes an accident by what is suitable for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a broken leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is large, and is called the thighbone; and the other is slender, and is called the shinbone.
And the treatment for any of the types of fractures that affect the two bones of the arm is the same as the treatment for a broken arm, and the operation for it is also the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is displaced in all directions.
And if the smaller bone is broken, the leg is displaced forward.
And if the larger bone is broken, you find it beneath, and it is among those things not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, reduction, and binding of the splints accordingly.
However, if the fracture of the leg is extensive with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and alleviate it with your skill.
And if there is some need for an operation on the arm in conjunction with the leg, and when you have aligned the splints and completed all your work, then you will take pieces of pine wood, placed beneath the things placed on cushions, and these are made similarly from palm branches; choose those with a small thickness and avoid the large ones.  Their length should be according to the length of the leg, from the top down to the lowest part.
And then wrap each splint in two layers of cloth, according to its length, placing one layer along one side of the leg and the other on the other side, extending from the top of the leg down to the lowest part of the foot.
And then bind the two splints at three places: the two ends and the middle.  With this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to either side, and it is held in a good position.
And now a brace of wood, the length of the leg, has been placed on it so that the leg is kept from movement.
And it is especially necessary that you do this in cases of fractures, and when this occurs properly.
And then examine the leg daily and study it thoroughly, watching out for abscesses, inflammations, or other similar problems.  And if any such condition arises, then apply what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the heel bone and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the heel doesn't happen often; but fractures of the foot bones do happen sometimes; and fractures of the foot toes happen rarely, and what occurs to them is mainly just friction in their positions.
And if the foot bones are fractured and sometimes those bones are raised above themselves, then the patient should place their foot on the ground, prepared as if walking.
And then place one foot on what is raised of those bones, and then press, and squeeze those until they return to their places.
And then apply a plaster and bandage over it, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot.
And then secure that with a downward pressure on the foot, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things you need.
And after three or four days have passed, then you loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones squeezed together, or broken, or dislocated, and the operation on these is as you know it.
But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and put them together as I and I have recounted to you in the restoration of fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and a little below it; and then, below the foot, this board that I have described to you, and secure it with downward pressure.
But if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more, then you place a splint on each finger, of its appropriate size, wrapped in linen cloth, and secure the board to the lower part of the foot, and place one end of the board over the stomach of the foot, so that it is held with good retention.
And it is fitting for you not to forget that you should consider all the things that I have told you about other fractures and accidents that we have discussed; and be prepared for any accident with what is necessary.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the thigh bone, and the pelvic bone, and the penis of the man.
When the thigh bone of a woman is broken, then make a splint from a polished board, and then gently incline it towards the back, and keep it behind.
And then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be placed on the thigh as a bandage; then the woman should be held, and raise her back a little at a time, because all this is done until the front of the thigh is in the expected position and the broken bone returns to its place.
And then place pillows on her back, and when she wants to urinate, she will remove the wool easily and then urinate, and you reposition it according to the method with which you positioned it at the beginning, then return it to its original position on the pillow.
And do this for seven days or so, for then it will be restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and place a reed cannula over the wound; and insert the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated within the thigh, for the fracture will return to its place.
And then it should be filled with wool and remain for several days, as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer in its restoration and reduction what we have recounted for a fractured hip bone.
And what is correct is not hidden in these recent and easily-healed fractures, especially for the one who has some study, use, and understanding of this my book's words; for that fracture signifies to you, in the greatest ways, the correct path to restoration and the tightening of it, therefore understand well.
But in the case of a fractured penis, take a bandage of cloth, and place it around the penis; then apply a wrap of cloth, and let it remain wrapped for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of bones when there is a plague.
It is convenient for one who has a fractured bone with a plague, and especially if the bone is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the humerus, or similar to those, that you apply cupping and phlebotomy as soon as the conditions for phlebotomy are suitable or as we have said above.
And if the plague is flowing blood, then you must apply cupping to retain it, using crushed glass powder over it, if no other cause is present.
And then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this, unless an abscess forms.
However, if a bad abscess forms, then you should leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not attempt it on the third or fourth days, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the exposed skin, then you must carefully reduce it and hold it in place with your hands with ease and minimal stretching.
However, if stretching is not appropriate and aligning it with your hands is not possible, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument.  This instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight inches, and its width is according to the size of the wound.  Therefore, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, according to the amount needed for the treatment in all types of fractures.
And it should be round, and have little thickness so that it does not buckle under the pressure during the operation.
And it should have a sharp end with a beveled edge on its ends; and the top of it should be thicker, tapering towards the middle sections.
And this is its form:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary for the pointed end to be placed raised above the protruding end of the bone.
And you push it in one go until the bone returns, and it is aligned with some equation.
And therefore, strive to align the fractured ends together.  If the broken end is small and doesn't readily accept the instrument, then it is necessary to cut the end of the bone until the instrument can grip it.
But if you cannot fully reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with whatever surgical instruments are appropriate or saw it with a saw in any way possible.
And then remove any remaining rough edges and small fragments from the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and immediately after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position; and therefore, do what you deem best to greatly help the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and if it is summer, do not apply a plaster or anything containing oil to the wound, so that you do not cause festering and decay.
And afterward, administer remedies at the time of completing the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered, then cut the wound with scissors and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be extremely careful not to compress the wound with the fractured bone, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and it has caused death or a corroding illness or a severe sickness, i.e., gangrene, upon their patients. And if your [treatment] is gentle, soft, different from the treatment of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear the harmful accidents we have mentioned, and you find pain in the area, then it is not appropriate to place remedies there, but make a dressing of hard cloths instead of remedies and bind it tightly.
And when, after about a day or two, pus has begun to form in the wound, then remove the cloth you had placed on it with wine, and then administer poultices, ointments with which, according to our custom, we medicate wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary for you to loosen the bandage and examine the wound each morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed, and the limb must be prepared in such a way that the pus can drain from it to the lower parts easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not healed nor is the pus draining, then know that there are complications, and you should examine the wound with a probe. And of those complications, those that are separable, remove and extract them; those that are not separable and cause pain to the limb, force you to incise them as far as possible.
And if pus or a discharge, that is, an inflammation, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, occurs on the wound, then you should apply whatever is appropriate for its treatment, as previously described in its chapter.
And concerning this, where my advice and your skill come in: when a large bone is broken, you should treat the limb in a similar manner to a broken thighbone, or other injuries of the large bones, and avoid attempting to pull it (the bone) out, or to remove it, because often death results from this; leave it to heal, because it will often fall into place by itself within 20 to 30 days; and then treat the wound if you see fit, or if it doesn't heal.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of inflammation that occurs in the area of a fracture.
Often this inflammation occurs in the area of healing from a fracture, especially if it's close to the joints, and it disfigures the limb's shape; and it greatly hinders the limb's natural function.
Then consider if the inflammation is recent and apply medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloes, linseed, myrrh, cerat, and similar substances; you may take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar, and apply this mixture to the inflammation on a bandage, firmly binding the bandage over it.
And leave it bound tightly for several days; then loosen it and apply another, until the inflammation is gone; or apply a thin lead plate firmly over it, for lead has the property of resolving any swelling in the limbs.
However, if the inflammation has become hard and tight and it is necessary to remove it forcefully, then cut it along its most prominent part, and remove the excess and prominent tissue, or cut it with some razors until it is gone; and treat the area until it heals.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural state.
When a broken bone is restored, and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, this is due to various causes: one is an excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not as it should be; or due to excessive tightness of the ligaments, hindering the flow of nutrients to the limb; or due to excessive application of remedies; or due to improper movement; or due to a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the cure for this is to feed the patient and make their body soft until the blood is replenished; and administer baths; and introduce cheerfulness and joy upon them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water compresses, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and prevent the operation from being properly performed.
When an accident causes a limb that has already been set to be deformed, with a crooked or protruding broken bone and a callus, and this has affected the limb's shape, but nonetheless, the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not believe someone who claims that the limb is broken again.
But many foolish doctors and bone-setters have done this in our land; and this practice is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which soothing herbs have been steeped, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and a softening poultice should be applied, such as a well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of marshmallow root should be made and mixed with hen's egg yolk or with beeswax oil, and applied as a poultice; or fat figs should be crushed with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal remedies that are known as healing salves.
And sometimes it is dissolved by diligent gentle friction with moist hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in every part at all times.
But if the twisting has progressed and become hard and stony, and if it requires surgical treatment with iron, then the inflammation on top must be stopped, and the continuity of the bone must be broken.  The excess callus of the bone itself must be cut away with fine scalpels, and care and attention must be given to the process.
Chapter 23.
Concerning dislocations.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place, preventing movement, distorting the shape of the limb, and causing the patient significant pain and injury.
Therefore, when an accident causes a dislocation, it is crucial to attempt reduction immediately, without delay, because if it is delayed, the area becomes inflamed and hardened, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And therefore, the limb should not be manipulated or stretched during the period of inflammation, because it often causes spasms and prolonged pain.
But when this occurs, you should apply a poultice to the inflamed area of the patient, and allow it to remain until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be bathed in warm water and oil, and the dislocation should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated in this way, so that the dislocated part returns to its proper place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, following the precedent set for fractures; from the most superior part of the body down to the most inferior.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.
So, the two jaws are dislocated if not quickly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their places and slightly softened; or they are completely and entirely dislocated, until they are softened near the joint, so much that the patient is drooling and cannot hold the jaw together or close his mouth, and his tongue is swollen (or twisted, entangled).
However, when the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place on its own with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and severe, then gentle reduction must be administered promptly, and no delay is permissible.
And the attendant must hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the fingertip of one hand into the area of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hand should be outside, helping to stabilize the jaw; and he should instruct the patient to gently close and separate their jaws; and the physician then manipulates the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its proper place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer a vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easier, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And therefore, when they have returned to their place and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over those powders bandages with a plaster, made of wax and rubbed oil; and then bind it gently with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not tilt to the right or left; and do not force them to chew anything; until the pain subsides and the jaws are healed, then let them eat as they please.
And this should be administered with care, and do not put pressure on opening the mouth for eating, drinking, and breathing until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often fevers and persistent sweating occur, and the patient's belly is strongly affected, and vomiting of pure bile is frequent.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and often the one afflicted by this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated inwards from its connection with the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is clear from the feeling/examination.
And the restoration involves the patient lying on their back and extending their arms. And then firmly press the area with your palm, for it will return to place.
And then apply a poultice and powders, and compress it.
However, the extremity that connects to the elbow and continues from that point is not dislocated in any given day; therefore, it must be reduced and bound as we have said, and as is appropriate for your procedure.
And then apply a poultice, powders, and a bandage, and instruct the patient to adhere to quietness and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated on the part toward the top, and on the part below.
And the second is that it is dislocated on the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in front by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and comes out on the lower parts towards the top, and mostly in those whose flesh is scant, it is easily dislocated; but in those in which there is much flesh, it is pushed out with difficulty.
And frequently, some men are struck or injured, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and is swollen because it has already been dislocated.
Then you must examine it until you are absolutely certain about it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts toward the shoulder; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you find a manifest difference between them; and you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and below the shoulder, near the touch of the head of the muscle, just like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor move it in any way.
If it is dislocated towards the foot or above, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And a gentle reduction of this dislocation is done when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the patient's hand towards the upper parts; then place your hands below the patient's shoulder, and raise the joint forcefully back into its place, and the minister raises the patient's hand, and extends it upward; and then places it back down, so that it returns easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a considerable time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient must be bathed in warm water and an application should be administered that softens and soothes, such as the juice of marshmallow root, fennel, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should lie on their back, and a wool pad be placed under their armpit that is neither too loose nor too tight, then the physician places their heel on the pad, and lifts the head of the muscle with strength, and pulls the patient's hand so that it is not pulled down towards the lower parts, and another attendant holds the patient's head so that it is not pulled down, and then the joint soon returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: have a man present who is taller than the patient, and stand on the opposite side, and he should place his arm under the patient's armpit and lift the patient's arm upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another attendant pulls the patient's hand downwards from the area below their abdomen. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary to have something else suspended with him, to weigh him down, so that the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced in another manner: a long pole is placed in the ground, the top of which is round, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin.  Then, the patient is placed beneath the pole, thick cloths are placed over the top of the pole.  The patient stands facing the length of the pole, and then the patient's arm is stretched downwards to the other side.  The patient's body is stretched in the opposite direction with strength, and the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult by all the methods we have described, then use this treatment: take a pole whose length is about two arms' length and width is about four fingers, and its thickness should be about the width of the armpit, shaped like this:
And then, thick cloths should be tied around the round top of the pole, so that the pole does not injure the patient.
And then, it is placed under the patient's armpit, and the arm or hand is stretched along the pole towards the lower part, and the pole is tied to the support, arm, and hand.
Then, the arm is placed on a step or rung of a ladder according to the width, and the hand is stretched downwards, and the other side of the body is suspended on the other side, for the joint will quickly return to place.
And when the reduction is completed by any method possible, you should place a thick wool pad under the armpit; then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder, ashes, and egg white to the entire muscle, wrapping it around; then bind the armpit with a suitable bandage; wrap the bandage over the plaster, and tie the patient's hand to the neck.  Leave it and do not move the hand for seven days.
And the patient's food should be kept light until the limb is strengthened, for this will be more helpful for its recovery.
Then, the diet is gradually increased to more than seven or five, and movement is encouraged; and if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated repeatedly due to moisture affecting it or another cause, then a cautery with three punctures should be administered, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization.
And if all this is done, and after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and bandage have been reapplied several times, and it is still not firm and fixed and the patient cannot raise that arm to the parts above, then understand that the nerves, which are at the end of the muscle, are already cut or extended or softened, and know that the joint will never return to its proper place.
For dislocations of the foot and the breast or back parts, reduction is achieved through pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns to its place.
And another bandage should be applied to that area, and treat it until it is healed.
And if, after the healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original natural state.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of elbow dislocations.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially in the front part and the back part.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident from the observation or touch, whichever way it is dislocated.  And when you adjust the dislocated elbow with your hands, this is clearly demonstrated to you, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes a suppurating boil, for if it becomes a suppurating boil, reduction is difficult, and the limb is not completely healed; and especially when it is in the back parts, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, with greater pain, and often leads to death.
And the restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's arm be extended with two hands, and the arm be stretched out. The physician's hands should be on the elbow, below it, and the physician pushes the joint with the tips of their fingers together, or with the heel of their palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is returned by bending the arm with the hand, until it strikes the elbow with the heel of the palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong, forceful extension.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and hold that extension, so that it is not pulled back from the extension.
And then the arm should be turned in every direction, since it is wrapped with a folded cloth/bandage long over the hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that these things help lubricate the joint easily; then push the joint with forceful pressure until it returns.
And after the reduction, it is necessary to place a compress on that area in which there is astringency and binding with egg white, and it should be bandaged tightly, and the arm should be suspended from the neck and left for several days.
And then it should be loosened; and therefore, if the joint is formed in its place, then you loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then you repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is tightened; and then loosen it.
But if it happens that there is a severe injury near the reduction of the joint, and its condition is in motion, then administer moistening in a bath and gentle friction and compression, until it is relieved; or place a soft, oily substance over the joint; and then bandage it, and leave it on the limb day and night. And then remove that, and put that limb in a bath; and when it sweats, then you rub the joint with moderate friction, and then repeat the application of the oily substance, once, and again, and a third time. with intervals of bathing, until it is clean.
And if you wish, place a warm, damp cow's hide over the wound and press firmly upon it; and do this several times, for it is moist and helps to restore it to its proper position.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated shoulder, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated shoulder is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy, and the opposite is true for other joints. However, speed in reducing it at the time of dislocation is necessary, before the area becomes inflamed or a painful abscess forms there.
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the injured person's arm on a table, and the attendant extends the arm; the physician then places his hand, or palm, over the protruding joint and pushes until it returns to its place.
However, it is important to consider if the palm is already turned towards the palm of the hand, then the patient places the back of their hand on a table to facilitate the extension and reduction.  And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the hand of the patient should be placed palm-down on the table, so the physician's hand can be placed on the projecting joint.
And therefore, if it returns quickly, it is good.  But if not, then hold it with a bandage, preventing inflammation, and leave it; and do not repeat this, for if you do, it will not endure or be able to improve in the reduction since days have passed.
However, if the joint remains crooked, and the patient doesn't feel any cause, but the hand is weak and cannot grip anything, then know that the nerves are severed or damaged.  In this case, there is no cure, but it should be cauterized near the injury, and a strong remedy should be applied.
Therefore, once the injury is healed, apply a bandage as previously described, and let it remain bound for five days; then, loosen it and let it heal, and exercise the hand.
However, if the movement is impaired and some weight is added, then you should alleviate it with hot water and some friction several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various directions.
And when any of those fingers are dislocated toward the palm side or the back of the hand, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation away with your fingers until it returns to its place.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is properly fitted into its place.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is straightened.
And do likewise if it is dislocated toward the back of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
When an accident causes a complete dislocation of a vertebra in the back or neck, and the displaced vertebra remains out of place, then in that case there is no cure, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's bowels are expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain them; and often some of their limbs or both legs or both arms, or one of them, become paralyzed; or a vertebra is displaced, for often it is displaced, and often the removal of those (vertebrae) is done in four parts.
Therefore, if it has already been moved to the rear parts, it is called a dislocation.
However, the treatment for it is that you then consider if the dislocation occurred due to youthfulness, for then in that case there is no cure nor complete healing.
But in those cases resulting from accident or impact or similar causes, the Ancients described various methods of treatment in lengthy accounts, from which the most beneficial ones can be learned; but I have already shortened that, avoiding the excessive length, for the sake of clarity in my presentation.  I have composed this using various instruments of which I will demonstrate and explain them.
And only those dislocations occurring on the back, specifically as I'm recommending, can be cured.
And the patient should be laid out on their face, close to a wall, and underneath them there should be a soft instrument to prevent the foot from being damaged.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the ground at the edge of the wall near the head, and another pole, at the opposite end of the wall, supporting the feet.
And one attendant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a hole; and another attendant should hold the other pole in a similar way.
And then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and, beneath it, tightly tie a strong ligament; and extend the end of the ligament to the pole positioned by the head, and tie it there; and then tightly bind another ligament over their hips, and down to their legs; and finally adjust all the ligaments and tie them to the other pole, which is positioned by the feet.
And then each attendant should extend the ligament to the pole's position, and the two poles and the ligaments should not be moved from their places, but nonetheless, should not be fixed quite so tightly as we have mentioned.
And then the physician places their palms on the spine with force until it returns to its proper position, or places a table there, and then makes the patient adjust their feet on the table until they are in the correct position.
But if it does not return in this manner, then take a board whose width or length is approximately three arms' lengths, and carve a space in the wall near the patient where the end of the board can fit in. And then place the middle of the board on the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its proper place.
And if you wish, use a turning device held in your hand;  place two poles, each one arm's length long, in the ground behind the patient's head, and similarly, place two more poles behind the patient's feet.  The distance between each pole should be a palm's width.  And each pole should have a hole in it through which the turning device can run. Make sure each pole is firmly anchored in the ground so that it doesn't move.
And place a round rod, on which the turning device is located, and turn it within the two holes of the two poles.
And at the end of that (rod) is a hole where the (rod) fits, its length being one palm's width, and this is the same for the other two poles.
And now tighten the bandages you have placed around the patient's feet on the part of the device near their head, and tighten the bandages around their thighs on the part of the device closer to their feet.
And near each turning device, let a helper turn the device with their hand, while the physician aligns the vertebra as we have described.
And after the vertebra has been returned to its proper position, and the area is aligned, you should apply a desiccated plaster with egg white, then bandage it.  Then place a thin wooden board, whose width is about three fingers, and whose length covers the affected area of the spondylosis, over the plaster and onto the spondylosis area.
And then bind it with the bandage we've described, and let the patient consume light nourishment until healed.
And if any lingering problem remains in the area after healing, then medicines that soften and cleanse through prolonged use of the table-method, as we have described, must be administered; and a lead sheet is applied to the area.
And sometimes a problem occurs in the lower vertebrae of the spine, caused by that dislocation; and that is the bone which is threatening to protrude, so that no presumption should be made with this medicine, for it will likely cause death.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the muscle are only susceptible to dislocation, and do not suffer the same conditions as other joints with minor displacement and cavity issues.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is more often dislocated inwards, and less so forwards or backwards.
A sign of dislocation inwards is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the knee, and the area where the bending should be is inflamed with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh bone has lodged there.
The sign of dislocation outwards is that the symptoms are the opposite of those in inward dislocation.
The sign of a forward dislocation is that the leg extends fully, but cannot be bent without pain in the knee, and if forced forward, it cannot go further; and their urine is retained and their groin is abscessed, and they walk on their heels.
The sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, nor can it be bent forward as the groin bends, and the leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is swollen, and the head of the thigh bone is in that area.
However, the reduction of these types of dislocations is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, already affected by the passage of time, you proceed with its reduction and it remains in its position, then that treatment is not complete; and therefore, no presumption of cure should be made in that case.
But in the case of a recent dislocation, one of the four types, you must try to reposition the joint, extending it both inward and outward, and moving it to the right and left, as strong, light pressure returns it and requires no other treatment.
However, if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend the leg from the lowest part, either by hand or with a bandage tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend the hand of the patient so that they place their hands under the patient's armpits; and then tighten a strong bandage on the thigh root, and have a third assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And its extension should be from the inside of the knee to the groin area, or from the back to the buttock area.
And the extension of all of these should be done at once until the patient is lifted from the ground and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is a common procedure for all four [types of dislocation].
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type [of dislocation] to proceed with the specific treatment.
In the proper reduction of a dislocation, when it is dislocated inward, the patient should be placed on their healthy side.  Then, apply bandages to the root of the thigh in the area between the top of the thigh and the groin; and then extend the bandage upward from the groin area to the highest part of the groin.
And then another strong attendant should take the patient's arms, and firmly grasp the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it outward with forceful extension, for this will return it to its place.
And this type is easier to treat, with which this limb is reduced than the other types.
But if you are unsuccessful and do not obey the method of treatment, in this type of case, it is necessary to bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each be about four fingers, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended above the head of the bed, and remain there; and their height from the ground should be about two arms' lengths.
And then order a strong young man to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another young man suspend the patient, and the other young man, grasping the thigh with strength, should push, so that the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, the patient should lie on a stool, as we have described when the knee has been bent; and the bandage should be applied firmly to the injured leg and to the patient's foot.
And then two beds should be placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at their head; and then beds fitted to the middle of the stool should be placed, covered with damp cloths, so that the patient is not harmed by the bed being between their thighs, so that the extension to the lower parts is not pulled.
And then each attendant should extend their part, and the physician, with their hand, will guide the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then the leg should be slightly extended, and it is according to this same method on a stool; and the physician places the palm of their right hand on the painful part of the limb, and then holds it with the other hand, and with that holding, extends that part of the leg downwards towards the front.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downwards, but elevated above the ground; instead, they must be placed on a hard surface, just as is required for the lifting if their hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about their positioning on two stools; and it is on their face, and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, not much.
And pressure must be applied with a bandage to the area where the joint is located.
Therefore, when the reduction is complete, as it should be—and the sign of the reduction is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them equal and the patient tightens their leg and expands it without excuse, then you know that the limb is returned as required—and then you bring the two thighs together and apply a poultice and bind them tightly so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then release the bandage and the poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
Now, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and plaster that, and tighten it according to your initial tightening, and leave it for three days.
And then release that, and have him/her walk on each leg for a few days, until he/she is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Of the cure of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outward, inward, and downward (or behind), but not forward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that, when you tell the patient to apply their leg with the thigh, then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these ways is that you should have the patient lie down straight, so that they extend their leg, if they can; place your arm on their side, and place their foot between your feet; then apply your palms to their knee, and grip them firmly with your fingers on the knee, and another assistant extends their foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return (reduction) is that their leg adheres to the thigh with a light, effortless touch.
And then bandage it and attach the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days, until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is difficult, then administer strong traction with the ligaments, about which the narration of the hip treatment has previously discussed.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
The ankle is sometimes displaced by a small movement, and sometimes dislocated according to the extent, and its dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that the ankle often swells on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for a small displacement is gentle repositioning; the ankle should be gently extended by hand and held until it returns to its place.
However, when it is dislocated to a significant degree, you must have the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and capable attendant hold the leg behind the heel in the middle of its displaced position.
Then, with your right hand, grasp the foot at the highest point, and with your left hand, grasp the lower part of the foot at the location of the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand, twice; then extend it with your left hand, and push the foot of the leg with your right hand towards the thigh effortlessly.
Do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the foot of the leg a third time, and you will be at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two attempts according to this method, and if you see the foot is well-aligned, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation, for that is the return.
But if you are unable to reduce it with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and place a tightly-tied cloth firmly on the ground, so it is positioned between their thighs, and you have already covered them with a cloth so that the patient is not injured.
And then the attendant holds their thighs, and another attendant extends the leg with their hands or with a bandage that is tied around the top of the leg; and then each attendant extends it against the extension of their counterpart, and the cloth is stretched between the patient's thighs, holding it there, so that the patient's body is not pulled down towards the parts below their extension.
And then the physician aligns the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh below, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And so, when the dislocation returns and you are satisfied with the reduction, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with bandages.
And you must be careful of the nerves that are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and injures it severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage has loosened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from movement for 40 days. But if he is forced to move before that time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be dislodged and ruined, and thus not receive a cure.
And if an abscess occurs, then you should apply to it what we have previously described in our narrative, as a cure and embrocation, until it is resolved.
Chapter 34.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the feet.
The dislocated one should be straightened with little effort, without struggle; and this is not difficult, but rather easy.
However, if the dislocation is in one of the toes of the foot, then you should have the patient place their foot on a flat surface, like the ground or a table, and be positioned as if they were walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot on the affected area of the joints, and then press down on it with your foot, firmly, until it returns to its place, and you see that it is now straightened and no longer protruding.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, covering the entire foot, with two supports, and firmly bandage it properly for three days; and then loosen it and have them refrain from walking for many days, until it is firmly set and the return to normal function is ensured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations caused by blows, or fractures, or both.
When any of those causes occur, and you exert yourself in the treatment and restoration of the patient, often death results.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat such a patient, but only the experienced and skilled physician, compassionate and patient, cautious, neither hasty nor presumptuous; and who should initially use only soothing remedies to reduce inflammation, and leave the patient to the judgment of God,  except for those in whom there is hope of survival, with alleviation of the illness, and a possibility of recovery. Then, strive immediately to reduce the injury at the beginning of the problem, before inflammation sets in.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that reduces inflammation and treats the injury with appropriate drying ointments.
And if a dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you should treat their separation, and do for it what we have said for simple injuries in the previous sections of this book.
And, according to your ability, avoid the pitfalls of fear in the paths of knowledge, as my teaching has instructed you; for this is more beneficial to you from your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more health for your true self in your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, for which may God be praised. Amen.
