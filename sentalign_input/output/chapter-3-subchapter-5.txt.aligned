of the collarbone The collarbone often breaks in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture occurs in three ways: either it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, which is the easiest to restore; or there is a fracture with a wound.	The collar-bone is very often broken from the end of the humerus anteriorly, and the fracture of it may be in one of three ways. It may be broken and separated into two without splintering; this is the easiest to repair. Or else splintering occurs, which is most difficult to repair. Or it is a compound fracture.	0.82545835
And the procedure is that when the fracture is without a wound, you need two assistants, one to hold the support for the broken collarbone; and the other to extend the neck towards the area; then align the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is no misalignment or shortening.	When it is a simple fracture the operation involves having two assistants present; one of them to hold steady the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to stretch the neck in the opposite direction. Then level the fracture with your fingers until it is reduced to its proper form and there is neither prominence nor concavity.	0.87066644
And if you need more extension, place a round ball of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder, and make it thick according to your need; and extend and lift the collarbone, and tighten the ball with your hand, so that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary.	If there is need of still greater extension, place in the armpit of the patient a ball of cloth or wool made to a suitable size; and stretch and lift up the clavicle and squeeze the roll with your hand until the fracture is set in the proper way.	0.8968844
And if you cannot pull the head of the collarbone outward, because it is deep, the patient must lie often on their back, and place a medium pillow under the shoulder, and the assistant pushes the shoulder down, so that the collarbone is raised.	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the clavicle outwards on account of its being depressed, the patient will have to lie on his back and there must be put under his shoulder a medium-sized bolster.	0.80529106
Then align the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken into pieces, you must cut above; and gently extract the pieces, and if the bone cannot join due to any overlap, cut it with one of the incising tools you have; but place this instrument under the collarbone to protect the membrane:	The assistant is to press the shoulder down until the depressed collar bone is elevated, and then you can set the fracture and even it out with your fingers. If you feel a splinter separated from the clavicle and movable, you must cut down upon the splinter and gently remove it. If the splinter sticks to the bone, you must contrive to cut it with one of the chisels you have prepared for that, having first put beneath the clavicle the instrument to protect the membrane; an instrument made of wood or iron, of which this is the figure.	0.7961243
and it looks like a spoon, and is not finished, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the extent of the work; and it has two ends, as you see, one wide, and the other narrow, as is the shape of the wound you made when you extracted the bones;	It resembles a spoon but without a hollow. It should be as broad as you need, having regard to the size of the bone, and as long as you can use at operation. As you see, it should be provided with one wide and one narrow extremity.	0.78353554
and when you are sure of preventing a hot abscess, sew the wound, and if the cut is small, or you fear a hot abscess, fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.	If the opening you made when you extracted the splinter of bone be wide and you feel safe against an abscess, suture the edges together. But if the opening be small or you fear an abscess, pack the wound with material and pads proportional to the opening.	0.69592035
And if a hot abscess occurs there, moisten a cloth with rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.	If an abscess occur, soak the dressing with oil of roses and vinegar or wine and apply.	0.82400423
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is to apply a poultice of mill dust and plenty of eggs to the bone, place light tow on it, and place a ball under the armpit if necessary; then take a very large bandage one palm wide, then place a double cloth over the tow, and the poultice; then take a delicate splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around the bandage, so that the ends of the bandage hang down; and place the splint on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and secure it from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture well, and you see clearly that the splint does not move on the broken bone, adjust it every day, and when the binding loosens, tighten it;	As to bandaging the bone when it is without wound or incision, it is thus: apply over the bone the plaster composed of mill-dust with egg-white and put over it soft tow; then put a pad in his axilla if necessary; then take a very long sling about a span broad; then place a doubled pad over the tow and plaster; then take a splint made of thin board; its width should be three fingers and its length the same; then wrap it in a rag; then wrap the rag together with the splint in that part of the sling that is over the site of the fracture; then tie the sling round the fracture and wind it round his neck and under his sound axilla and under his injured axilla and carry it several times in every direction as you judge best that the bandaging will hold the fracture firmly, for it will be apparent to you. The whole point is that the splint should not slip from over the fracture; so you should examine the patient every day, and whenever the bandage has loosened and you see the splint has shifted, then put it right and tighten the bandage.	0.9205054
and have the patient lie on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when they sleep, to lift the support upwards; this will relieve the fracture of the collarbone by lifting the shoulder, or tie the arm to the neck, and do not untie it unless bad symptoms occur, for twenty days;	Make the patient sleep lying on his back, and at night when he is asleep place a small bolster under the axilla so as to raise his arm from his side, for with the raising of the humerus the fracture of the clavicle will be elevated. Or bind his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage for twelve days unless there arise at the place any pruritus or swelling.	0.8855074
then restart the poultice if necessary, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is restored; and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in less for some people.	Then renew the plaster if you think it necessary, and bandage again and leave until the fracture of the collar-bone is set and knits. The majority of these cases are firm and strong in twenty-eight days, though in some people it takes less.	0.7344647
