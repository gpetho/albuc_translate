On the Restoration of Bone Fractures When There is Also a Wound
Chapter 20.
If someone experiences a fracture with a wound, especially if it is severe, like in the hip bone or its support, or something similar, you should act quickly and immediately perform bloodletting if the conditions for bloodletting are present, as previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, then you must proceed to cut it and apply powdered dried sage over it, if nothing else is available.
Then begin to repair the fracture on the same day; do not delay unless an abscess develops.
But if a hot abscess forms, then postpone the repair until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for you could cause harmful complications.
If the broken bone is protruding from the exposed skin, then you must attempt to realign it and level it with your hands with gentle pressure and slight extension.
If alignment and extension with your hands cannot be prepared, then realign it with this instrument.
The instrument is made of iron, with a length of about seven or eight fingers, and its width corresponds to the size of the wound.
Because of this, the physician needs to have three or four of them, depending on the amount required for treating any type of fracture.
It should be round, with a slight thickness, so that it does not compress under pressure during the procedure; it should have a sharp end, with an edge at its tip.
The upper part should have thickness from the middle to the bottom.
And this is its shape.
In this procedure, the sharp, curved tip should be placed over the protruding bone end and pushed once, until the bone returns and is somewhat aligned.
Try, therefore, to align the ends of the fracture with each other.
If the ends of the fracture are delicate and the instrument does not hold it well, then you should cut the end of that bone until the instrument can hold it.
If you cannot realign it completely with the method we described, then cut it with the appropriate tool we mentioned or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
Then scrape off any roughness and small splinters remaining on the bone.
When the bone is realigned, and the patient experiences intense, piercing pain afterward, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Do it, therefore.
For you provide great relief to the patient when the restoration you perform on the bone is complete.
Then soak a cloth in black astringent wine.
Especially if it is summer.
Do not place a poultice or anything containing oil on the wound, to avoid causing rot and decay in it.
Then apply splints at the moment you finish the bone restoration.
Leave the wound exposed, making an opening in the bandages with scissors to match the size of the wound.
Take every precaution not to tighten the wound with the fracture.
For foolish doctors have often done this and caused death, erosion, or “zuchem” (that is, discharge) in their patients.
Let your binding be soft and gentle, different from the usual binding for fractures.
If the wound is severe or large and you fear certain bad complications we have described, and there is pain in the area, then you should not place splints over it.
Instead, make bandages from firm cloth in place of splints, and bind it with them.
After one or two days, if you see that pus is starting to form in the wound, then remove the cloth you placed over it with the wine.
Then apply linen bandages and ointments that we customarily use to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is advisable to loosen the bandage.
Observe the wound every day, morning and evening, until it stabilizes and heals.
The limb should be positioned so that the pus can flow downward easily.
If many days pass and the wound does not heal, nor does the pus cease, then you should know that there are small bone fragments within.
Therefore, it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe.
Remove and extract any of those bone fragments that are loose.
For those that are not loose but pierce the tissue and cause pain, try to cut and remove them by any means possible.
If the wound develops zuchen, ekileten (that is, necrosis), or any other form of rot or decay, then you must treat each of these conditions with the appropriate remedy, as previously discussed in its respective chapter.
What I must emphasize, and what you should bear in mind when a bone breaks and protrudes over a limb, such as the hip bone or its support, or other large bones, is not to attempt to pull it; often this causes death. Instead, leave it until it decays.
It may indeed fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see fit; if not, leave it alone.
