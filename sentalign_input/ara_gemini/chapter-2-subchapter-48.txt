Chapter forty-eight on the slow maturation of tumors that occur under the armpit
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the pig type, hard, contained in a sac.
And some of them contain fluids, so what contains fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner:
From line B to line C.
When all the pus has been discharged from the swelling, wipe it with worn-out cotton.
And leave it until the next day.
Then remove the cotton and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
If the swelling is of the type of scrofula, then incise it as we mentioned in the incision on scrofula, similarly.
If the wound persists until it produces pus, then use cauterization on it as we mentioned previously.
