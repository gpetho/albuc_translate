On the treatment of a fracture when, after repair, the limb remains unnaturally thin.	On the treatment when restoration leaves the limb thin and not in its natural state.	0.793175
When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this happens only for several reasons. One reason is the frequent loosening and improper binding of the ligament, or due to the excessive tightness of the bindings, which prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to excessive embrocation at the wrong time, or due to a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.	0.8690701
The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on.	The treatment is to feed the patient and to soften their body until blood increases in it. And administer baths. Introduce joy and cheerfulness to the patient.	0.7685375
