of the form of the clyster
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or pewter, or cast or hammered brass; and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered.
Those then that are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and suffering, are small.
The form of the clyster, small and large, is wide at the top, where the bladder is tied in this manner:
and there should be a separation where the bladder is tied, as you see, and the bottom be pierced within; and have two holes on one side, and one on the other; and the bladder where the medicines are placed should be made of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have a finger's width between each hole, then thread a strong thread of raw flax, twisted ten times or around, into these holes, and gather the bladder like a goat's udder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster; and this is the form of the circle:
And the medicine should be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the tip of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the administrator squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraw the clyster, and the patient raises their legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it in as long as they can; and if they sleep a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you administer a clyster for diarrhea, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until they are healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or an abscess, the clyster should be as slender as for a child; and this is the form of the slender clyster on which the leather is tightened:
