of the contortion/spasm of the mouth	Cauterization of the twisted mouth.	0.42356312
Contortion/spasm that should be treated with cautery is only that which arises from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illness; and do not apply cautery to similar conditions that come from dryness and nerve spasm.	The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses. But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	0.7446888
When you treat this type of contortion/spasm that arises from phlegm with purges and head cleansings and gargles, and that is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the base of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips; and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make the cautery next to the top of the ear a little below the crown of the head, and another on the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery in place until half of the core is burned; and this is the form of the cautery: And the appearance is like the small knife that we have described before, but it is a little more slender and the blade should be a little thicker; afterward treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.	When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips. Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal. The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin. The shape of the cautery.	0.82870984
