of the canker/ulcer
We have spoken in the division about the appearances of a canker/ulcer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid treatment with iron; and we say the canker/ulcer generates in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a canker/ulcer is in a place where one can scrape it, such as a canker/ulcer that is on the breasts, and on the thigh, and in similar places, one should remove it completely when it is in the beginning stages; and when it is large and old, you should not approach it, for I have never been able to heal one; nor has anyone ever healed one before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile; then bleed them if they have obvious plethora, then prepare a good place for the patient to do the work; then cast your hooks onto the canker/ulcer, and shave it from all sides, and remove it entirely without leaving anything; and let the blood run freely, and squeeze the area well with your hand or with something, and if the flow of blood from the incision of the artery or vein hinders you, cauterize it until the blood is stanched; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
