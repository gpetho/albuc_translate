Chapter 59.
On the quality of bladder clysterization with a clampcedra and similar instruments that are suited for this.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or coagulated blood, or it is restricted by putrefaction, and you want to instill waters and medicines, then use an instrument called a clampcedra, which has the following shape:
It has a blind end, meaning it is closed.
And in it there are three holes: two on one side, just like you sometimes see.
At the beginning, there is a concave place, in which what is pushed is, and it should be the right amount to fill it, without addition, so that when something is pulled from it, the moisture is drawn in, and when expelled, it is drawn with it, and when expelled far, just like the clampcedra with which naphtha is shot in naval battles.
So when you want to inject moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clampcedra into the moisture, and pull with it what is pushed to the upper parts, as the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clampcedra.
Then insert the end of the clampcedra into the penis as we have described with the syringe; then push the moisture with what you are pushing, as the moisture reaches the bladder quickly, and the patient feels it.
The shape of the fine clyster with which the bladder is clysterized, and this is its shape:
It should be made of silver or brass, with the top part resembling a small feather, and below it a tube inside a ligature.
Then take a bladder from a small animal, place in it the moisture you want to inject into the bladder, tie it between two points with a strong double ligature, and heat the moisture over a fire.
Then insert the end of the clyster into the penis.
Then squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with firm pressure until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder available, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; perforate it around its circumference; then insert a strong bile into those holes, as it is rolled; then add the circle so that it is held like a stopper, after you place the moisture you want, and oils and waters in it.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and squeeze with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
