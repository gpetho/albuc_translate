Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, so that corruption reaches the gums and the teeth become ugly because of it.	Sometimes there collect upon the inner and outer surface of the teeth and also between the gums, rough scales, ugly, sometimes black or yellow or green, from which corruption is communicated to the gums and thus the teeth become unsightly.	0.8289751
You should seat the patient before you with his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and the tooth on which you see the scales and the sand-like substance, until nothing of it remains. Likewise, you should do with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and so forth, until you clean them.	The patient should sit before you, putting his head in your lap; and you should scrape the teeth or molars on which you can discern crusts or gritty substance, till nothing remains; do them all in the like manner, black, green, yellow, and the rest, until they are all gone.	0.8942689
If what is on them goes away with the first scraping, then [stop]. Otherwise, you repeat the scraping on another day, and a second and a third, until you achieve the desired goal. And know that the molar requires scrapers of various shapes and many forms, depending on what is suitable for your work.	If they disappear at the first scraping, good; but if not repeat the scraping on the following day and the second and third until you attain your purpose.	0.64865625
Because the scraper with which the molar is scraped from the inside is not the scraper with which it is scraped from the outside, and the one with which it is scraped between the molars is of another form. And this is a number of forms of scrapers that you should have all prepared.	You should know that molars need scraping-tools of many diverse forms and shapes according to the character of your undertaking; for the tool with which the inner surface of the teeth is scraped differs from the tool with which the outer surface is scraped; and that for scraping between the teeth is different again. Here is a number of scrapers, all of which you will have ready by you .	0.7142409
