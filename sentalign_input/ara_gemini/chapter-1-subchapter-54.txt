Chapter fifty-four on cauterizing tremors.
If someone experiences tremors due to coldness in the nerves or from quartan fever or other causes
then it is advisable to cauterize him four or five times on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra a cauterization
and on his chest a cauterization
and on his stomach a cauterization with an olive-shaped cautery iron
for the tremors will cease and it accelerates the maturation of the cold illness.
