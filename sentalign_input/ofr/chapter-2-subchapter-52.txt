when the intestine comes out
If the appearance of the intestine comes through a wound cautery or a tear in the peritoneum, and it is on the abdomen and some of the intestines come out of it, as happens in other ruptures, or blood that flows from veins or arteries depending on what is in front, or from flatulence; and if it is through the rupture of the peritoneum and by the protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a mild thing without pain, and appears with various discharges.
And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when one presses it with their fingers it goes back in, and then comes out again, and perhaps it is hard, and greatly enlarges upon entering the bath and due to strong exertion.
And if it is due to fluid, it is a mild thing, and appears readily when you press it with your hand, and is not constrained; and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears by these signs, large and hard, and fixed in a certain quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the task is for you to see if the appearance is due to blood from an artery, or from a vein, or flatulence. 
Then you must abandon the treatment.
For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and lie stretched out straight, then mark with ink all around the swelling; then have them lie face down between your hands, then go around the place that you marked with the spatula, then stretch half of the abscess above with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or with a cord of strong silk firmly, and the knot of the tie should be loose; then open half of the stretched abscess above the tie, and insert your index finger, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught in the tie, untie it, and push the intestine back inside the belly; and if you find the bowel, take it with the hook, and cut off the excess; and if the artery or vein gives you trouble, proceed carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles across what you have done in a cross that you make pierce; then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and shave the abscess as we have said; and remove the blood or fluid that you find, then treat the area as appropriate, and suture the area.
