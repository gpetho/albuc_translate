And sometimes it is a serious, fearful, and dangerous abscess, and of dark color, and sometimes it comes from a node in the artery, or from swelling of a vein.

Sometimes also it arises from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as has been mentioned, or from an inflation of the veins.	0.65332687
When it is from a node in the artery, it is known by the hot abscessâ€™s disposition when you press it with your fingers; And you should not touch it.

And if it is attached to the sac, or in what is inside the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that tissue and cut it roundly.
