On the Dislocation of the Toes and their Treatment.
Chapter 35.
The dislocated toe must be aligned with gentle extension without strain, which is not difficult but rather easy.
If the dislocation is in one of the joints of the top of the foot, have the patient place his foot on a flat surface, such as the ground or a board, as though he were standing.
Then, stand and place your foot over the protruding part of the joint.
Press down with strength until the joint returns to place, and you see it aligned, without protrusion.
Then place a board beneath his foot that covers the entire sole, with two ends.
Then bind it with a moderate binding for three days.
Then release it and have him refrain from walking for several days until it strengthens and stabilizes to prevent re-dislocation.
