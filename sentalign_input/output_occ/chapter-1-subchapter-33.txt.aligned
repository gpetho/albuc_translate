On the cauterization of the abdomen.	On cauterization for diarrhoea.	0.7900201
When the abdomen is affected by cold and humidity, weakening the digestive and retentive functions of the stomach and intestines, and it is treated using conventional methods without success, sometimes the patient may require cauterization for beneficial results. Then cauterize with a large cautery on the stomach as previously described for stomach cauterization, with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauterizations around the navel, using a thin nail-like cautery; and cauterize on the prominent part with one large cautery, or two cauterizations.	When the diarrhoea is due to frigidity and humidities so that the capacity of the stomach and intestines to hold and to digest is impaired, and this has been treated by various methods and is not cured; if you see that the patient is able to endure the cautery and is of unimpaired strength, make a big cauterization on his stomach according to the preceding instructions for cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four narrow cauterizations round his navel with the thin claviform cautery; and one or two big cauterizations in the lumbar region over the coccyx.	0.85905993
If the excess humidity persists and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize the lower abdomen and intestines, adding two more cauterizations on the stomach and near the groin, as this treatment is highly effective.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one. This is an effective treatment that does not fail to help.	0.7235291
