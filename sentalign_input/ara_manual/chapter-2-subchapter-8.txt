Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that occur on the eyelids.
These warts that occur on the eyelids may be moist and may be dry.  It is necessary to grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel. Then apply powdered vitriol to the area.
If they bleed, cauterize them with a gentle lenticular cautery. Cauterization is best after cutting, and they frequently return if anything of their roots remains. If cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return.
