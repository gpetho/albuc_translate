Chapter Thirty-One.
On Cauterization for Ascites.
Cauterization is only beneficial in the case of tympanitic ascites specifically. If you have treated the patient with ascites with the various treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and your treatment has not been effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
And another cauterization on the liver and a cauterization on the spleen and two cauterizations behind his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open, draining pus for a long time.
And do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization with what is necessary so that it brings together the two meanings, and healing will quickly come to him.  The shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized should be nail-shaped as its image preceded, and the one with which the stomach is cauterized should be olive-shaped.
