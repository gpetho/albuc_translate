CHAPTER TWENTY.	Chapter 20.	0.7026258
When the whole eye is prominent and there is no reduction or impairment of vision, you should get the patient's bowels open.	When the eye protrudes fully, and there is no damage to vision or decrease in it, then it is necessary to calm the patient, then bleed him, and next place cups on his neck without incisions, but with suction.	0.6694835
Then venesect him in the cephalic vein; then apply cupping vessels to his neck without scarification and draw off by gentle suction; then put to the eye a poultice made of acacia and aloes and olibanum and sarcocolla; then bandage the eye over the application with many pads.	Then place a liniment on the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla. Then compress the eye with multiple cloth pads over the poultice.	0.7706717
The way to make pads is to take a number of soft rags and fold each into four thicknesses. Prepare a good many. Then put them one on top of the other as the eye requires; then bind on stiff bandages over these, tying them firmly.	The method for the pads is this: take many soft cloths and fold each one in four; make many of them, then place them one on top of the other, according to the size needed for the eye; then press firmly over them with a strong, coarse cloth.	0.907519
Repeat the cupping with suction and without scarification.	And repeat the cupping with suction, without incisions.	0.84187543
Then take away the cupping vessel and leave the eye bandaged a day and a night.	Then remove the cups, and leave the eye bound day and night.	0.8716121
If the bandaging slackens during that time, it must be tied properly. Then remove the bandaging after a day and a night, as we have said.	If the bandage becomes loose again, then it must be tightened greatly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.	0.84351957
If you see that the eye has receded, good. Otherwise repeat the applications and pads and bandages and the cupping till it does recede.	If you see that the eye has now returned to the layer of the uvea, it is good; if not, then repeat the poultice, pads, compression, and cupping until it is healed.	0.79042363
