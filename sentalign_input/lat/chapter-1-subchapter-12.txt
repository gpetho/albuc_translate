On the method of cauterizing for water descending to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When signs of fluid accumulation in the eye become evident, as discussed in the disease divisions, begin by giving the patient something that will purify the head.
Keep the patient away from all sources of moisture, and have him sit in a steam bath while fasting for several days.
Then instruct him to shave his head, and apply a cautery to the middle of the head.
Next, cauterize both temples if the fluid is affecting both eyes or on one side if it is in one eye, severing all veins and arteries under the skin with the cautery. These cauteries should extend along the temples' width; take care to avoid excessive blood flow.
If bleeding is observed, immediately cut it off with whatever means possible. I will elaborate further on artery extraction and cutting and ways to prevent excessive blood flow.
In some cases, two cauteries should be applied at the back of the neck, beneath the two bones, as a final step.
