Chapter Fifty-Four:
On the cauterization for tremors.
When someone has tremors due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever caused by cold, or other similar causes, then cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and one on the chest, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery.
This will calm the tremor and hasten the healing of the cold-induced illness.
