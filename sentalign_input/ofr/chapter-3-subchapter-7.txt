of the fracture of the breastbone/sternum
The breastbone/sternum is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely;
but it often breaks lower down.
And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the displacement is visible in the broken bone, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is as follows: the patient often lies on his back, and you place a cushion between the shoulder blades, then press the shoulders, and bring the ribs of the two sides together with your hands, and be careful to set it evenly in all the ways that you can, so that the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then apply plasters and compresses on a thin splint of wood, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move;
and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it appropriately, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs to be untied, because of corrosion or itching that occurs at the site, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and untie it, and scrape the plaster, and address what has appeared there by means of treatments;
then reapply the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
