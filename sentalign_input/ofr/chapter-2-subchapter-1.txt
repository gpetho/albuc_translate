of the head full of water
Know that this disease often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard; and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I have never seen this disease except in children, and in all those I have seen death came quickly; and therefore it seems to me that it is better for me to abandon the work in such treatments. 
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew every day so much that he could not support it; and the fluid grew so much that he died, and this fluid had collected under the bone on the membrane, between the brain and the bone; and the procedure is as follows if the fluid is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you make a wide incision in the middle of the head; and let it be as long as two nuts, so that the fluid flows; and here is the form of the spatula:
If the fluid is more abundant, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the shape of a cross, according to this form:
And if the fluid is under the bone, and the sign that you see is the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it with your hand inside, and this is not hidden from you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this way:
And after the incision, draw out all the fluid.
After, bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put in wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day; then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and keep the head evenly bound, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you look where the size of the abscess and the collection of fluid appears; for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Then cut there where the abscess appears, and where the fluid is collected, and make the incision according to what you are able to do; and be careful not to cut the artery; lest a flow of blood come, so that the patient dies from the loss of blood and the evacuation of fluid.
