Chapter Three.
On the repair of the nose if it is broken.
Know that nothing of the nose is broken except its two upper bones together or one of them, because they are bone, because what is below it is cartilaginous and is not broken, but it is subject to bruising, bending, and flattening.
If one of its two bones is broken, it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside until you restore the nose to its natural shape, and let this be done gently and carefully so that no pain is caused to the patient by your action.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger does not reach it, it should be straightened with the tip of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and hasten to repair it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert a wick of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the wicks be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the wicks should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not see that; rather, the wicks should be moistened with egg white kneaded with mill dust.
Then leave the wicks until the bone is fixed and the cartilage is hardened.  You can also insert goose feather tubes into the nose in place of the wicks, after wrapping soft rags around them, so that their retention of the nasal fracture is stronger and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
This is not necessary; if you wish, do it, and if you wish, make the wicks.  If a hot swelling appears on the nose during your work, dress the nose with cerate or with cotton dipped in vinegar and rose oil or some diachylon ointment.
If a hot swelling does not appear, you should dress it from the outside with semolina flour and fine frankincense kneaded with egg white, then place a soft compress on it and do not tie the nose with anything at all, if the nasal bones are fractured into small pieces.
Or if they are fragmented, then you should incise over them and extract them with the appropriate instrument, then sew the incision and treat it with what heals and closes it from the appropriate ointments.  If a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes.
until it heals.
