Chapter thirty-nine on removing the leech stuck in the throat
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not succeed, then look at that time in the throat of the sick person in the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument that was described to you, and if your sight falls on the leech, pull it with a small hook or with a smooth, tight piece of date fiber.
If you are not able to do it with it, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the throat of the sick person near the leech, then insert into the inside of the tube a piece of iron heated by fire; you do this several times and the sick person abstains from water for his entire day, then he takes a bowl filled with cold water and opens his mouth in it and gargles with it and does not swallow a drop of it and moves the water from time to time with his hand, for the leech will fall on the spot when it senses the water.
If it does not come out with what we described, then fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida with the instrument that was described in the fumigation of the uvula, you do that several times, for it will fall.
And the way to work in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are embers heated by fire, and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole, and you install in that hole the end of the instrument, then you throw in the incense, and the sick person puts his mouth at the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not come out until he knows that the smoke has reached his throat, for the leech will fall on the spot.
If it does not fall, then the fumigation is repeated several times and the sick person endures thirst and eats salty things and garlic and does not drink water, so it must come out with this procedure.
And this is a picture of an instrument with which you pull the leech from the throat if the sight falls on it, and it resembles hooks, as you see, except that it has this curvature that enters the throat, and its two ends resemble the mouth of a bird, in it is the roughness of a file; if it bites on something, it does not leave it.
And another instrument with which the tongue is depressed, and it is a wide ring of iron, as much as the mouth can accommodate above the tongue, enters the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open without the patient's will.
And he is absolutely unable to remove it until you remove it.
