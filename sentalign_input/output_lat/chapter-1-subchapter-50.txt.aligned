When cancer is beginning, and you want to halt it, then cauterize around it with a circular cautery, following its circumference.	When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.	0.8497126
The wise have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center.	Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle.	0.54262245
However, this does not seem advisable to me, as I fear it may ulcerate, and I have seen this happen several times.	This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	0.73357224
It is better to cauterize around it with a circular cautery as we mentioned, or with multiple cauteries.	So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	0.8575859
