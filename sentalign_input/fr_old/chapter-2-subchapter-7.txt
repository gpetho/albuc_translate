About the blockage of the ears
Some children are born who have no openings in their ears; and this same thing happens to men by blockage from a wound, or flesh growing inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep inside the ear, so it cannot be seen; and sometimes it happens a little outside the hole, and it can be easily seen.
So that which occurs deep inside, if it cannot be seen, is of difficult healing in many cases, and in that which can be seen, you must place the ear of the patient in the sun; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then work it with this spatula of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and back, so that it does not injure the ear; if the blockage is of grown flesh or body of the ear, then hold it with delicate pincers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is all removed.
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a light, delicate razor and heat it a little in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear. If you feel the blockage where the patient feels discomfort in hearing, pierce lightly, and make sure you do not injure the nerves of the ear; then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the hole, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment.
Do this for some days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it with rose water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it; and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and place another tent moistened with wax made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then plunge a sponge and cloths into cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.
