Here begins the book of fractures
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish doctors avoid this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books nor read any text on this subject;
and for this reason, science is rare in our land, for I have never found anyone good in this field;
and I know nothing of it except through the science of ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have drawn science from them, through experimentation, and by the practice of my life;
and I have already described to you in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments used, just as I have done in these two previous chapters.
