After I have completed this book for you, my Sons, which is the last in the science of medicine with its complement, and I have reached the end of it according to its exposition and declaration, it seemed to me that I should complete it with this Tractate, which is a part of the operation, namely surgery with the hand.
Because the operation by hand has fallen into disuse in our region and time, so that perhaps its knowledge has perished and its trace has been cut off; and nothing of it remains except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have changed, and error and hesitation have befallen them until their intentions were closed and their power was distant. It seemed to me that I should revive this science with the arrangement of this Tractate in it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I come with the forms of the tools of cautery and the other instruments of work: as is done by the addition of declarations and their hastening.
The reason why a good artisan of it is not found with his hand in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has narrated, until he knows the supports of the limbs and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and sinews, and their number, and their exit, and the pulsatile and quiet veins, and the places of their exit.
And because of that, Hippocrates said: "The name with the name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of hand.
But we have already spoken about this at the beginning of this book.
"For one who is not skilled in anatomy may fall into error, by which people are killed: as I have seen many of those who boast about this skill without knowledge or experience.
"That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut out a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and he cut some of the arteries in the neck; therefore the blood flowed from the woman until she died in his hands.
"And I saw another physician who dared to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large. "So he came to him and removed it with a piece of the bladder. "Therefore the man died on the third day.
"And indeed I had already been called to remove it; and seeing the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
"And I saw another physician who was receiving a fee from a certain Duke of our land for his medical skill; and it happened that the Duke's black eunuch had a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound up the fracture on the wound with bandages and tight cords, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
"Then he released him according to his wishes. "After a few days he dismissed him and instructed him not to loosen the bandage; and it remained so until his leg became swollen, as well as his foot, and it came to ruin.
"So I was called to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and he was restored to peace, and escaped from his pains.
"However, the corruption had already set in the limb; and I could not prevent it.
Thus, when the corruption ceased wandering through the limb, until it died.
And I saw another physician, who punctured a cancerous abscess: and after some days it ulcerated, until its evil grew great with its lord.
That is, because when it is a pure cancer of black bile, then one must not approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can endure it, so that the whole of it may be cut out.
And for this reason, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with health, and the operation with which there is danger in many cases.
And I have already pointed out in every place of this book where the operation comes which has terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and abandon it, so that the foolish may not find a way to speak and dishonor it.
Receive therefore the measure with diligence and care, and your weak ones with ease and strength, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success: and put away terrible diseases that are difficult to cure: and lift up your spirits from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation may not enter upon you in your faith and advantage. xspace
For it is more lasting to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
For Galen has already said this in some of his warnings. Do not treat the disease badly, lest you be called bad physicians.
Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Chapter One
Of the Cautery with fire, and of the Cautery with sharp medicine, arranged and ordered from the head to the feet, and with forms of instruments and tools of the Cautery: and everything necessary for the operation.
Chapter Two.
On incisions and punctures, bloodletting and cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and similar things; all arranged according to the shapes of the instruments.
Chapter Three.
On the restoration of dislocations and the treatment of twists, and similar things; arranged by parts from head to foot and according to the shapes of the instruments.
But before remembering the use of cautery, it is necessary to say what its beneficial and harmful qualities are, and in which constitution it should be used.
I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the benefit and harm of cautery is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and hidden secret.
Many wise men have spoken about it and differed on the subject, and for me a little of their speech is enough, fearing lengthiness. ︎
I say therefore that cautery is beneficial to every constitution, whether material or immaterial, except for two constitutions: a hot constitution without matter and a dry constitution without matter.
But in a hot and dry constitution with matter they differed. For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it. And others said the opposite, that is, that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness; since the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal a hot and dry illness with what is hot and dry.
And the one who speaks against that says: that by cautery there is a benefit in every hot and dry disease which occurs in human bodies; because when you compare the human body and its humors to the nature of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I say through his statement: because experience has revealed this to me many times.
However, it is not necessary that this be attempted except by one who has already been tested and practiced in the last exercise of cautery, and knows the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of diseases within them, and their causes, and their symptoms, and the duration of time for them.
From the other complexions there is no need to fear, especially in cold and moist diseases. For all doctors have agreed upon them; and they have not disagreed about the benefit of cautery in those cases.
And know, my sons, that the secret of treatment by cautery with fire and its goodness is superior to cautery with burning medicine, because fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the member which is cauterized; and it does not harm another connected member, unless with slight harm.
But the action of burning medicine extends to what is distant from the members; and perhaps it brings about disease in the member which is difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except in excess.
Indeed, we have learned this through experience because of the length of our service and study with art, and our commitment to the truth of things; and for that reason I am excused from further discourse.  />  />
And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would bring you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in expelling humors from the body, demonstrated with philosophical discourse which would be understood by your minds.
And know, my sons, that they disagree about the time when it is suitable to perform cautery, and they consider spring to be a better time.
And I say that cautery is suitable at any time; for the harm caused by the time will be overwhelmed by the benefit derived from cautery. And especially if cautery is necessary because of severe and persistent pains that do not tolerate delay; for fear that from them something worse may occur than the slight harm caused by the time.
And let it not enter your minds, my sons, that only the common and foolish physicians think so; namely, that the disease which is cured by cautery does not always return: and they put forward this consequence, but it is not as they think; because cautery is only in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes of pains.
Nevertheless, cautery excels medicine in the swiftness of its effect, and the power of its action, and the strength of its dominion: and it is possible for the disease to return at some time according to the complexion of the patient, and the location of his disease, and its power; and what has been prepared in his body through the accumulation of superfluous humors in him; and what reaches him from his food and similar causes, unless the disease is one in which cautery is applied.
A slight disease of a member with few superfluous humors and moisture, such as tooth cautery for pain, and similar conditions, it is possible that this pain will not return. But this happens rarely.
But the common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine is true; not in the sense they intend by it; for they believe that there is no cure which is as effective as medicine or any other treatment after cautery has been applied. (){#}
"The truth of the matter is contrary to this, and the intent is that cautery is the last resort in medicine; it is not used unless when we apply methods of healing for some ailments, those remedies do not work. Then at the end, we apply cautery, and it helps. Therefore, it follows that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and most ignorant physicians understand.
"The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the nobility of its substance. They also said that the site of the cautery does not become inflamed. "In truth, this is not absolutely the case; for I have already tested it and found that, in some bodies, it does so without any other cause.
"And cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said. "However, when you use a cautery made of gold in the fire, it does not indicate to you when it has reached the desired heat because of the redness of the gold; and if it cools down too quickly, and if you add more fire, it melts in the flame and turns into layers.
"For this reason, the craftsman falls into difficulty with it; and for this reason, cautery made of iron is quicker and more convenient for us, being suitable for the operation.
"And I have already arranged this chapter on the cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they may provide relief for those seeking something from it.
"Chapter Two
"This cauterization is beneficial for controlling moisture and coldness over the brain, which are two causes of headaches, excessive flow of humors to the eyes and ears, too much sleep, toothache, throat pain, and universally all ailments that occur from coldness, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method of cauterization is as follows: first instruct the patient to evacuate with a cleansing purgative for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habit.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. Then have him sit facing you, with his hands placed on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.  />  And do this three times in succession.
Then prepare the cautery iron for the fire: its form is as follows.
Then place it on the marked spot with ink, gradually tightening your hand as you turn it. Then quickly lift your hand and look at the spot.
If you see that the bone has been exposed to the size of a lentil or a grain of barley, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat with the same iron or another one if this one has cooled down: until you see the bones I mentioned to you.
Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a cloth in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it there for three days.
Then place a cloth soaked in butter over it, and leave it on the spot until the scar of the fire is destroyed.  /> Then treat it with four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
They say that the more open the wound remains, the more pus is released, which is better and more beneficial.
And some say that the skin should be cauterized all the way to the bone, and that the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then it is scraped from the burned area of the bone, then it is cleaned.
And others say that one should use the cautery until it reaches the end, so that it makes an impression on the bone in the shape of a circle: or they use a small instrument that women place into infusions of alphabet letters; and they believe that the vapors of the head are expelled from this location, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be cleaned until it heals.
But these two types of cautery seem to me not at all except in some people according to the way of fear.
And leaving it is better for me with his health.
The head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have testified with other members; and especially when the head is naturally weak due to illness. The first type of cautery, however, is safer and better for me, and I use it. Therefore, operate with it in safety.
Chapter 3
When a chronic and persistent pain occurs in the whole head of the patient, and he makes use of hyeres (a type of poultice), coches (ointments or unguents), head purges, oils, and emplastrums (medicated plasters). And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one-pronged cautery that we have described, and none of those things help him, then consider this. For if the patient's head is of a strong natural constitution and not weak, and he finds severe cold, then cauterize him with another cautery under that one, in a small amount. Then cauterize him over every horn of his head with the cautery, so that it does not penetrate through the skin, and expose a quantity from the bone as we have described. And burn it with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called vas: and lift up your hand in this manner, and do not expose the mouth. For the patient will find on account of this a very severe pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
And I call this cautery the one for its place: and it should be a cautery that is finer than the one used to cauterize the horns of the head and its back.
Chapter Four
When pain occurs on one side of the head or extends to the eye and is evacuated with purgative drugs, and the remaining treatment as I mentioned in the divisions of diseases is not effective, then cautery for this condition is according to two methods: either cautery with a burning, acute drug; or with iron. 》
The cautery with a burning, acute drug is as follows: take one tooth of garlic and peel it, and cut off the tips from both sides of it. Then split the painful place in time with a wide fleam until there is made under the skin a space in which to insert the tooth.
Insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then tie over it with a suitable bandage; and leave it for fifteen hours; then untie it, and extract the garlic, and let the wound be left open for two days, or three; then place on it cotton soaked in butter until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed. 》
And if you wish to do this with some burning drugs that I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron is done in this manner. A cautery of fire, the form of which is this.
And it is called a nail-shaped cautery because the form of its head is like that of a nail, in which there is something of curvature, and in the middle of it is a small projection.
Then place it on the spot and hold your hand steady; and you revolve the iron little by little with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, as its half. And lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a piece of cotton in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days; then place the cotton with butter; afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this half of the skull with the tip of a small knife similar to the cautery. And beware of cutting an artery in this half of the skull, not properly ancient.
§ On the manner of cauterizing in the old half of the skull.
When you treat the half of the skull with what we have said in the previous treatment and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not help; and you see from the disease that what we have said from the first cautery with medicine or with the cautery with fire is not enough for it, then you must heat a knife-shaped cautery until it turns white after you mark on the spot of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or almost like that; and lift your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Nevertheless, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jawbone that moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned and a spasm occur.
"And let it be over a cover, as a precaution against bleeding from the cut artery. "For its incision is fearsome, especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is neither diligent nor experienced; and he abandons the operation first of all.
"And I will discuss the regulation of bleeding from an artery according to its manner and in the appropriate place in this book.
"But if you see from the illness that this cautery is not enough, and you see the patient's body enduring the cautery on the middle of the head, as we have described, take care of the wound until it heals.
"And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a double-bladed cautery. "For cauterization is better and more beneficial this way.
"On the method of cauterizing for ear pain.
"When ear pain occurs from cold and is treated with dissolving remedies and the other treatments we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not go away, then apply fire cautery. And this is what is called a 'punch,' which has this shape.
"Then apply the punch after its burning around the entire ear, as it is shown; or around both ears if the pain is simultaneous in both. "And keep the cautery away from the root of the ear for a short while after marking the spots with wax; and let the number of punctures be ten on each ear, as shown.
"Then care for the spots until they heal.
"On the method of cauterizing for toothache.
Chapter VII.
"The toothache that is treated with cauterization is only from the types that occur from phlegm, as we said in the divisions of diseases.
And avoid cauterization for conditions caused by dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of pain with herbs, and head washes, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, a second a little lower than its tympanum, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side from the afflicted area. Because softening occurs only in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize with a cautery directly on the upper edge of the ear, a little below the horn of the head; and another in the tympanum, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb. And place your hand with the cautery until the thickness of half the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species made from a knife, whose form has been described; however, it is not somewhat thinner than that which you see, and it must be a knife with a little excess thickness.
Then treat the places with what has been mentioned until they heal.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for an old stroke.
When the stroke has become old, and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head as we have said, and a cautery in the back of the head, according to what has been described: and the method of cauterization is according to what has been described. 》
And also cauterize with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is the most important [cautery]. 》
Then it should be scraped with what precedes it.
Chapter 9.
It is necessary that first of all, large doses of horehound and pills cleansing the brain be given to the patient to drink.
Then shave the whole head of the patient and place upon his occiput a plaster made of mustard, as described in the treatise on plasters; and repeat this several times.
For this is the method of cautery, and perform it in the same way as I mentioned there.
If therefore he is cured by this, that is good. If not, then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between each cautery a thickness like that of a finger.
Then treat the cauteries with what preceded.
But if you wish to add to it and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle. If you wish to add (to it), then cauterize him on both temples.
Then treat (the patient) until he is cured; and let the cautery be anointed with oil according to the aforesaid form.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for paralysis and flaccidity.
Chapter 10. ︎
It is necessary that you proceed with the cleansing of the head using horehound and as we have said. ︎
Then shave the head of the patient; afterwards cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of his head and a cautery on each temple, and a cautery on the back of his head, and three cauteries on the nape of the neck.
But if you need (to do) many things in the illness of flaccidity of the body, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is strong, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the nape of his back, and the last one until it burns most of his skin, and lift your hand. ︎  Then care for him until he is healed: and thus apply the cautery oil.
On the Method of Cauterizing for Epilepsy
An epileptic is not cauterized unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, you should first cleanse his brain with hyeros and with the other treatment that we have mentioned in the division, when the patient is large or is able to take medicines.
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then give him a gargle and cleansing foods to chew for many days before that with the improvement of his food.
Then shave his head, afterward cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of his head, as has been mentioned before in the manner: and with another cautery on his nape, and on each horn of his head with a cautery. If the patient is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have mentioned for one who has paralysis, and apply softening to his body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery oil be according to the manner that has been mentioned.  />
But if the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery, in this manner.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing for Melancholy
When the cause of melancholy is foul moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have mentioned for one who has paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess flowing down to the melancholy, and his body is moist, then give him in drink what cleanses his brain, as has been mentioned before in the division: then shave the head of the patient, and make afterward a nicely made ring from linen, like a circle.  />
Then place it on top of the head; and let the patient, seated on a stool, be held firmly from every side.
Then present the ointment. And it is better made with ancient goose fat. And heat the ointment over a moderate fire to the degree that a finger can bear when inserted into it. Then evacuate it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools down.
Do this for the patient once every week, along with the rest of his good diet, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, except that you should hold the hand with the cautery; indeed, it should be smelling.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place upon it a compress soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ On the method of cauterizing with descending water to the eye.
Chapter 13
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you through the signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink along with something that will cleanse his head.
And keep him away from all moisture and make him sit in a bath while fasting for some days.
Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize him on the middle of his head. 》 Then cauterize him over both temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water begins in both eyes at once; or on one side, if it begins in only one eye: and cut off all the veins and arteries which are under the skin with the cautery; and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples; and beware of bleeding. 》
If you see anything from it, then cut him off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the wisdom that is in extracting the arteries, and cutting them off, and being careful of bleeding.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under two bones, with two cauteries completely extended.
On the way of cauterizing the old tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old and constant, and they are on the veins and arteries which are externally visible on the forehead, it is verified that this is from cold and phlegmatic excesses; then cauterize with the same cautery as I narrated in the beginning for descending water, one cautery in the middle of the forehead, and two cauteries above the temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the bones. And if you need an addition, then cauterize it on every side of the eye, above the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the way of cauterizing nose stench.
When you treat it with what we said in the section on division and the treatment is not beneficial, then hurry and give infirmocochias to drink for three nights; afterwards shave his head and cauterize him with a medium cautery, and with an olive oil cautery. Then cauterize him with two nail-shaped cauteries on the outer edges of the eyebrows under a few hairs.
And be careful not to cut into the artery.
And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
On the way of cauterizing for softening the eyelid. ‌
When the eyelid of the eye is softened from illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, and this lunar-shaped cautery. ‌
And if you wish, cauterize it a little on the outer edges of both eyebrows with two cauteries all around; and let them be distant from the temples; and let the length of every cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not bring your hand to an end with the cautery, rather according to the amount that is burnt on the third eyelid. ‌
About the way of cauterizing the eyelid when the hair turns back and pricks the eye.
The caustic in it is according to two methods: either the caustic with fire, or the caustic with burning medicine.
But in the caustic with fire, first instruct the patient to let their hairs grow out, if they are among those who pluck them, until they lengthen and even out. But if they prick him at their growth, then bind his eyes with a ribbon so that they do not move until they are born.
Therefore, when they are born and even out, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark on his eyelids with encaustic, a mark like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a cotton soaked in egg white or in the mucilage of fleawort over the eye. ¶ Et sic cauterizabis eum, et sanabitur.
Then the caustic with fire, whose shape is this:
Then cauterize over the shape that you have marked little by little in many times, until the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, becomes completely evident.
And the sign of health of your work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and the hairs lifting from the pricking point of the eye.
Then lift your hand; and leave him for three days. ¶ Deinde adiungas ei, in uino cum zibado, puluerem aloes de quattuor partibus, et mellis de uno: et mitte illum per nares.
Then place a cotton with butter on it, until the scab is removed. Then care for him with ointment, until he is healed.
If any hair grows back after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did first.
But if the hairs are on the lower (eyelid), then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place, and it is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
It is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are lengthened and evened out. Make from linen cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take from known soap and from unmixed lime a weight of one ounce or about that amount from each; then grind them together well until they become like this quickly, so that it does not cool down. Then spread the paste from this onto the linen cloth you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or two eyes. ︎ And place under the eye a compress soaked in egg white, and let the patient's head rest on your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it briefly. And you move it whenever the patient feels the burning of the medicine, for its burning is like fire.
While this persists, which the patient finds to be a burning sensation, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning sensation has subsided, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water. ︎ ︎
And then consider if you see the eyelid being raised, as it is raised by contracting with fire or with incision; that is good. And if not, then repeat the medicine on the same spot where the medicine does not imprint and does not darken, until your work becomes even and the eye contracts. ︎ ︎ ︎
Then place on it the kohl with butter until the skin of the burn is removed. Then treat it with diaphoretic ointment or another until it heals.
And it is necessary for you during the treatment that you guard with the highest care lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
And if the eyelid softens after some days and something from the hairs enters into the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which becomes softened from the eyelid as you did at first. Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness. Therefore let your consideration be according to this, and the way of righteousness shall not be hidden from him who is dedicated to this art.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Tear Duct.
When you treat the fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed: then it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and let an assistant hold his head between his hands so that it does not move or shake with his head.
Then place kohl mixed in the white of an egg or in slippery elm mucilage on his eye; then with a cautery iron, whose form is this. ➤
Let it be hollow like the form of a vulture feather from one end, with which is made the cautery; and if its strength is to penetrate to the other end, and if its strength is upward thus do you try.
However, this hollow (one) is better for your work.
Then express the fistula if it is open, and draw out its pus, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and draw out its pus. ➤
Then place a hot cautery on it.
And hold the cautery with your hand near the eye and towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the cautery on the eye fat and burn it.
If you reach the beginning of the vein all the way to the mouth, it will be well. And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then put a compress with butter on it, and care for him with a drying ointment until he is healed.
But if forty days have passed and he is not healed, then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the mouth is uncovered; and scrape it according to its chapter.
And there is another method of cautery for a fistula, which some have said first. Find the place of the fistula and locate it; then put a thin camahan, that is, a thin cannula, whose form is this. ➤ And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with the canula firmly, so that the patient is not moved at all, lest the molten lead run or reach his eye. ➤
And it is necessary to put a compress soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For molten lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with a wonderful healing.
But if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to enlarge the nasal passage and redirect the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come to its own proper place. ➤ ➤
To Cauterize Fissures of the Lips
Often there are fissures on the lips, which are called "hairs," and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you are treating these fissures with what we said about the division of diseases, and it does not help, then prepare a small cautery blade like this one.
And let its concavity be according to the sharpness of the blade.
Then quickly place the heated one on these fissures until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissure.
Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
To Cauterize a Fistula of the Mouth
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts: after that it becomes chronic and runs with pus, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and it does not help in that case, then you must heat the cautery according to the size that fits into the fistula. ething is that if there is a fissure on the lip of a child, you should be careful not to burn too much of the surrounding flesh, because the child's flesh is soft and tender and easily burns. Then insert the heated one into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we said about treatment until it heals. ething is that if there is a fissure on the lip of a child, you should be careful not to burn too much of the surrounding flesh, because the child's flesh is soft and tender and easily burns.
If the pus drains away and it heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the necrotic flesh according to what will be said in its chapter.
"On the Method of Cauterizing Soft Gums and Teeth
When the gums are softened due to moisture and the teeth are loose, and after treating them with medicines they do not improve, then place the patient's head on your lap.
Then, take a cautery tool whose form will be described later, and place the cannula over the tooth. Quickly introduce the burning cautery into it, and hold your hand for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times according to your will.
Then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.
For a loose tooth is made firm, a softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
"On the Method of Cauterizing for Toothache
When toothache is caused by coldness, whether the cold is within the tooth itself or in a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help, then there are two ways to apply cautery to it: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
The method of cautery with butter is as follows: take fresh cow's butter and boil it in an iron ladle or a bronze bowl. Then take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe. 》 Then dip the cotton in the boiled butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools down; then repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; then place a burning iron on it until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
"The cauterization of it with fire is performed by placing a tube of air or a tube of iron. "And there should be something thick in the body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the wound.
"Then take a cautery of fire and place it on that tooth until the cautery cools.
"Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or another day.
"And it is necessary for the patient to fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
"And this is the form of the cautery.
"Cauterize with whatever sharp end is possible; and this is the shape of the tube.
"On the method of cauterizing in cases of thrush.
"When thrush is caused by phlegm and cold moisture and does not respond to treatment with medicines, and you wish to quickly hasten their digestion; then take a hollow cautery of fire, the shape of which is this.
"Having two open ends, so that the smoke may escape from one end; and place it ignited on the swelling once or twice if needed, until it reaches the depth of the swelling.
"But if the swelling is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the swelling.
"Then leave it for three days, and place a piece of cotton soaked in butter on it until what the fire has burned is removed.
"Then treat it with tooth salve until it heals to the shape of a tube.
"On the method of cauterizing hoarseness and constriction of breath.
When moistness overcomes the bronchial tube, especially when it is with cold disposition, then the sick person should be first evacuated with purgative medicines.
Then burn the patient on the neck at the root of the throat in a depressed place; and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, except for something of it.
Then burn the patient with another cautery at the neck joint in the last vertebra of the collarbone; and let the cautery be small according to the previously mentioned method.
Then treat the patient with what has been mentioned until he is healed.
On how to burn in lung diseases and coughs.
When cough and lung disease are from cold moistness, and the patient has no fever or phthisis (consumption), and the disease is not chronic, then burn the patient with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, mild, empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cautery be like a reed according to the previous method.
And if you wish to burn by pricking with a cautery called the Point, whose shape has been mentioned for pricking ear pain; and let the pricks be up to thirty in number, almost to the others.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he is cured.
And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this shape. Why is the burning alleviated when you do with it in one application the work of three cauteries? >()
Chapter 27.
When the head is dislocated because of humors and does not reset within an hour after its dislocation, until it becomes habitual for it to return, then it should be reduced from a slight movement that occurs as we have already testified about that; then you should reduce the dislocation first. Then the patient is turned onto their back, or onto their healthy side. Then lift up the skin which is on the inner part of the thigh with your left hand fingers and if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
Then take a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this:
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates through to the other side, and a figure of four cauteries will appear.
And sometimes the cautery is done with a three-pronged cautery, which results in a figure of six cauteries; and these prongs are according to the fineness of the thread.
And this is the form of the three-pronged cautery.
And sometimes an additional one is added to this method, making eight cauteries in total.
Then place crushed garlic mixed with salt on the cautery. Then make the patient lie still so that the limb is not moved at any time until it becomes stronger.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, which rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery or by making multiple punctures with many cauteries.
For the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.  />
¶ On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture affect the stomach, to the point of drawing it away from its natural temperament, and produce catarrh in it, and when the repeated methods of treatment prove ineffective, then the patient must be turned onto their back, extending their legs and hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries: a shell-shaped cautery the size of one finger joint on the chest, along with a nail-shaped cautery, and two more cauteries below, one on each side of the first cautery, until a triangular figure appears. And extend between both so that they do not join when making pus.
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery by which this is done be one, according to the form of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it with this cautery: and it is as if you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish with encaustic: then cauterize it with the point cautery; then treat it with the treatment mentioned until it heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing cold spleen.
When pain occurs in the spleen from cold and moisture, or from excessive flatulence, until it excretes its superfluous excretion according to its natural constitution, and the patient is treated with what we have said, but does not improve: then it is necessary that the patient be turned onto their back, and mark three cauteries with encaustic in this form and size below the hypochondrium, where the arm reaches: and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body. And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery.
And let the quantity that is burned be half the thickness of the skin, without addition: and let the patient stand on their feet.
If, however, the patient is unable to stand, then let them lie down with their legs extended and their arms raised.
This is the form of the cautery.
And you may indeed be able to cauterize this cautery with a scalpel cautery when you have skill and knowledge in the art.
And beware not to proceed too far in cauterization, so that the thickness of the whole skin is burned, which burns the whole body and reaches the intestines; for there the skin is thin, know this.
On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
When the abscess bursts and you want to know whether it is in the flesh of the liver or its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a pain and weight without sharpness comes upon the patient; but if it is in the membrane of the liver, along with the pain there is severe sharpness. And you see that his physicians have been tired out by his treatment.
Therefore, the patient should lie on his back. Then mark the site of the abscess with a cautery; then heat the cautery which resembles a ray. And this is its shape. And burn with it once until the whole skin is burned and reaches the abscess, until all the pus comes out; then treat him with the treatment of bursts until he heals.
And it is not appropriate for someone to use this kind of cautery unless his study in the art of medicine has been prolonged and through whose hands these diseases have often passed with experience; then indeed he may dare to perform such an operation.
But to leave it alone is better in my opinion.
¶ On the method of cauterizing pleurisy.
The ancients said: for cold pleurisy, use a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia in this manner. eben And it is done by taking from the dried roots of Aristolochia a root longer than the others that can be found there, and let its thickness be like that of a finger. Then immerse it in oil and light it on fire. Then cauterize with one cautery between the continuation of the furcula and the neck, and with two small cauteries slanting downwards towards that which is under the beard.
And with two more cauteries slanting downwards towards the back between the fifth and sixth ribs; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And three more cauteries from behind: one between the two scapulae; and two below that cautery which is between the two scapulae.
And it is not necessary to press the hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in plain sight, giving off its scent on the skin.
And some ancient authorities have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron like a needle, and they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out, as we have said concerning the hepatic abscess.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula results which cannot be healed.
§ On Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
When you are treating an illness of the spleen, according to what we have said about the division of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then there are three ways to cauterize it, all of which are correct.
The first is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauteries whose figure we have described earlier.
And between each cautery there should be the thickness of a finger or a little more or less.
And the method of cauterizing should be as we have described for the liver cautery, equally so.
And do not press down with the cautery, and let the patient be lying on their back.
And another method of cauterization is as follows: Heat the cautery that has two prongs, which we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the arm; and raise the skin that lies directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches; and let your raising of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then introduce the two red-hot prongs until you pierce through the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cautery. Thus, four cauteries are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery that has three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you have released it to discharge pus for many days, for it is more beneficial than any other previous treatment.
On the Method of Cauterizing for Hydrops.
The cautery does not work in hydrops except when used on the affected area itself. />
When you treat a hydroptic patient with the treatment methods mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not take effect, then it is necessary to cauterize him four times around the navel, and once on the stomach, and once on the liver, and once on the spleen, and twice on the back between the shoulders, and one directly over the chest, and another directly over the stomach. And let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.  />
Then leave the cautery open so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment after the cautery, for two benefits are added to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
The form of the caustic used to burn the stomach should be like a key; and that used for burning the back should be like an olive leaf, as described above.
On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
When they become swollen in a dropsical patient and fill with yellowish water, you should cauterize above the sole of the foot, which is between the auricular and annular bones; and lift up your hand with the caustic, and do not twist it; then lift up your hand, and do not press it at all.
For the yellowish water will ooze out, and let the caustic be of this shape.
Then make two caustics on each of the two legs, and let the caustic be with a knife-shaped tip; and let the caustic be as long as the leg, one below the knee and the other lower than that, about halfway down the leg. And make two caustics on each hip. And leave the caustic open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may ooze out from it; then treat it along with the others we have mentioned.
On the method of cauterizing to relieve abdominal pain.
Chapter XXXV.
When there is abdominal pain due to cold and moisture, which weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with remedies but does not heal; and you see that the patient can tolerate a strong caustic, then cauterize him strongly on his stomach, as described before for the method of cauterizing the stomach with a circular caustic, and four subtle caustics around the navel, with a subtle key-shaped caustic; and a large caustic over the groin above the testicles, or two caustics.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize with a hot iron over the comb and a hot iron over each eye; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the great vein.
For indeed is a treatment that is successful, whose benefit does not go astray.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or just one, from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humidity, and they are treated as we have said in division, but no cure is effective; then cauterize with three hot irons on the lower back of the spine under the almieda briefly in a triangular shape, and with one hot iron under the navel about two finger-widths.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled and he cannot digest food, and you see his face swollen; then cauterize him with a large hot iron on the stomach as before, and with one on his liver, another on his spleen, together with a clavicle cautery. Leave the cautery open for some time, then treat him until he is cured.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut out a hemorrhoid, then heat a hot iron that resembles a ray. Then insert the glowing iron into the cut hemorrhoid, and with your hand press until the hot iron reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
If therefore the hemorrhoids are many, then cauterize each one with a hot iron as we have narrated. xspace Then treat them with that which is beneficial for them from the ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the cataract, it is more effective for treatment.
On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not comply with the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he will be cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when someone has an anal fistula and it becomes chronic, pus runs from it, along with corrupting moisture. It is more appropriate, therefore, to probe it with a fine probe. Then recognize its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray [of light]. Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the amount of depth that the probe entered.
And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupt bodies are burnt away, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessity.
And beware of burning the nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder body, or the intestine body, then beware of all these places. ︎
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and know that it does not penetrate deeply.
Then care for the place until it heals.
But if the place seals up and matter separates from it, and it remains like this for a long time; then know that it has already been completely healed.
And if matter does not separate from it, then know that it is deep-seated, or there is a corrupt opening within it, or something like this; whose reminder will come in its place.
On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or excessive flatulence, and it lessens because of this weakness of the patient, then you should cauterize him above the almenthenem on the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a small cautery, which comes before the remembrance.
And perhaps we will cauterize him a second time in that same place. Why will three lines appear? Therefore, they will be more effective in the end.
§ On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
When there is weakness and softening of the bladder from cold and moisture, to the point that the patient cannot hold urine, then you should cauterize him on the lower part of the abdomen over the bladder where the hairs of the pubis begin, with a cautery from the right side of the abdomen and another from the left. And let the length of this cauterization be according to the width of the thumb joint; and you should cauterize him with a lower back cautery or with two if you need them; and it should be as the small cautery comes before.
§ On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
When there is cold and moisture in the uterus, which prevents impregnation and corrupts its menses, delaying their onset, and causing pain during their arrival, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel as we have said for the bladder, and with a cautery over the alcatim on the lower back, or with two if necessary; and let the cautery be small.
§ On the method of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation.
When mucous humors flow to the ankle and cause it to leave its place; and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when compared, and the place of dislocation is found empty.
It is therefore necessary to cauterize the patient over a box of Anchae with a similar cautery circle. After marking it with wax around the box as it turns, so that the box itself falls into the middle of the circle.
If this cautery is not available to you, then use three cauteries: a large olive-oil cautery and make the depth of the cautery according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then care for it until it heals.
§ On Cauterizing for Sciatica
When pain occurs in the bladder and its cause is cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division of humors, but it does not help and the disease persists, then you must free the patient from thick humors with stinking pills or artificial pills and similar ones. Then cauterize him.
And the method of cautery is according to two methods: either a cautery with drying medicines or a cautery with fire. xspace
A cautery with fire is done in many ways.
One of these methods is to cauterize over the bladder itself with three triangular cauteries in this shape. ️ And make them of good or bad depth. And let the space between each cautery be the size of a thick finger, and let the cautery be made with olive oil.
Sometimes, however, the cautery is done in the middle over the head of the bladder itself. ️ ️ ️ Why are there four cauteries?
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form has been described for the cauterization of bladder dislocation, do so with one, so that the circle contains the entire bladder.
"And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery for sciatica when the pain clings to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize with two cauteries over the hip, on the spot where the patient indicates that the pain is, and your cautery four fingerbreadths towards the tendon briefly; and let the cautery be knife-like.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
But if the patient indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize there where he indicates with a point or three, or four, or more, as needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cautery that you do not go with the cautery to the point of burning a large nerve or artery and thereby draw a harmful disease or contraction upon the patient.
And indeed I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized over the tendon and carried the cautery to completion, and their leg swelled up until a tumor reached the foot and the whole thing burst, and the entire foot was corrupted; then came an opening in the belly, and death after that.
But if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this manner.
And some wise men said in the cautery of the hip, whose method this is. Make a similar awl from iron, whose diameter is half the width of a palm; and at its opening let there be according to the thickness of an almond, or slightly less; and inside that awl let there be a third awl.
And let there be a space between each samium equal to the thickness of the thumb; and let the samia be open on both sides; and let their height be like that of a knot, or two knots; and make for them a handle from iron, well fitted into the samia.
Then it should be heated in the fire until it turns red and sparks fly out; then it should be placed on a weak patient's side, above the healthy part of the chest. Therefore, cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave him for three days. Afterwards, apply plasters with butter; and let the wound remain open for many days. Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis said: "O my son, we have used this kind of cautery little because of the frightening appearance of it; and also, because few can bear its application.
However, for him who endures, it is among the good cauteries, and he who finds a place for it will be successful with it.
The cautery is also made with adherent medicines, such that you should make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which descends the pin of its door, either from bronze or iron, as long as the wall; whose height should be two knots, or similar to them.  />
And let the space between the two be the thickness of a finger; and let them be open below and above; and let them contain each other in this manner.
Then place it on the chest of a weak patient lying on the healthy side. And press your hand firmly against the chest. Then pour between the two samia warm water which has been heated a little by fire, and hold it for an hour; and let the patient endure its burning and its scorching, for he will find the burning like fire until the burning ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument and wash away all the hot water from the wound with sweet water; then leave it alone for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed; and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it. For it is most helpful in treatment.
Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
But if the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make for him a bath in which there is water, as you did for the wound, in the same way.
And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it down in the chapter on rectifying medicines. Take soda and unslaked lime in equal parts; grind both of them finely and put them in a new pot whose bottom is pierced with one small hole through which the liquid can pass, and under the bottom of the pot place another glass pot, and pour over the soda and lime sweet water so that it covers both by a finger's width; then press them firmly with your hand; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over another lime; and strain it through a cloth until it is clear.
For then it will be very strong, which is used in many operations of medicine and in the cautery of other members. Because it performs the action of fire itself.
And among the medicines that are used to cauterize wounds, there is also terebinth resin and almond oil and lime mixed with soap.
And indeed Galen reported the cure of a certain ancient man, by which he was cured of pain in his wound and sciatic vein; and he praised it greatly. 》 And he said that no other treatment was needed, and that he was cured after one application until he reported that perhaps he had entered a bath house and came out of it already healthy.
And take it from a green sebet plant: and if you cannot find it fresh, take the dried kind, recently harvested. Grind it very finely with some fat, and place it on the ulcer where there is pain, either on the leg or in the hip. Bind it, and leave it on for three hours, or however long the patient feels relief from the burning sensation. Then introduce him to a bath.
When his body becomes sweaty, place him on a stool. For the pain subsides and he is cured.
And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines unless after purging the body.
And Dioscorides said that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, helps it: and this is how you make the cautery. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place that is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle bone, which is closer to the ankle bone.
Then take dry goat dung and burn it in a fire until it becomes charcoal. ›
Then place the charcoal on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then repeat that process. Do not cease to do this until the sensation reaches the ulcer and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the goat dung cautery.
¶ On the Cautery for Back Pain
Sometimes back pain occurs due to many causes, such as injury, a blow, or excessive purging, and similar things, from the infusion of cold, wet matter. And indeed, cautery is only indicated in this particular case, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
It is therefore necessary after the evacuation of the patient with foul-smelling pills and similar ones that three lines be made on the back where it hurts, according to the width of the almeidat itself, after marking with a cautery in each line five or more burns, as many as come from the strength of the patient's tolerance. And let the cauterization be done with a cautery point.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using the middle of a nail-shaped cautery according to this method.
On the method of cauterizing an incipient hump.
This illness often happens to small children.
And the sign of its onset in children is that a stricture occurs in their breath as they rise and move, and it is found in the last vertebrae of the back and in its nodes, which have already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
When you see it and wish to do this, then cauterize with a circular cautery according to this method.
And let the cautery take hold of each part of the vertebrae equally. If you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery, make two or three lines and let the points be close together.
Then care for the place until it heals with what we have said.
And beware of applying a cautery to a hump caused by a nerve spasm.
On the method of cauterizing gout and joint pains.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow into any part of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, according to the custom of physicians, they properly name it gout.  ()
When treating gout caused by cold with remedies and the pain is not removed, then a cautery will remove them.
And it should be that he is cauterized after purging around the joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive oil-based.
And if you need to prick on the surface of the foot, then do it with a small pricking iron. If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him on every knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using the same clavile iron.
But if you need more of this cautery, then cauterize him again. And do not plunge your hand with the cautery; rather let it be about as thick as the skin.
But if the pain ascends to the knees and back, then administer what we said about the cautery in its own chapter.
But if the pain is only in the hands, then prick around the joints as two lines revolve.
But if any pain remains in the fingers, then prick them on every joint with a single prick, and also on the palm of the hand.
But if after days the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
And do not purge the patient from a good diet and from taking medication. For if a good regimen is followed and the phlegm is purged, he will be healed with God's help by means of this cautery.
¶ On the method of cauterizing ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or scrotum descends to the testicle, and this is an urgent case, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to abstain from food for that day. And let him use laxatives so that his stool may pass from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and instruct him to hold his breath until it comes out, or a turd appears, or the intestine.
Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark the place of the rupture above the anus with a cautery, with a mark whose end is like half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then apply fire to the cautery until pus comes out and it throws off scabs. Then reduce the intestine or turd back to its natural place. Then have the assistant place his hand over the site to prevent the intestine from exiting; and you have now opened between the patient's thighs and placed a pillow underneath, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery over that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright. And hold him until you reach his mouth with it; or repeat the process with another if you have not reached the mouth on the first try.
And be mindful of the exit of the intestine during your cautery, lest you burn it and cause death or great harm to the patient through it.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your work is in vain.
And it is necessary for the cautery of infants to be fine, according to their measure.
Then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound closes.
And it is necessary that you provide his food during the time of his treatment, so that it may soften his belly; so that the intestine does not come out at the attempt or discharge.  />
Then, when he wants to get up after forty days, give him a well-made bandage and let him keep it for another forty days.
And let him be kept from labor, and from filling his stomach with food and drink, and from loud voices.
For when he follows this treatment, he is healed by a complete cure.
And I will describe the treatment of hernias with incisions in its own chapter.
But when hernias occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his hernia with a round cautery according to its size: and let what is burnt be one-third of it. ))) Then treat him as we have said, and there will be no increase.
And some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape.
After it is marked with the cautery, and a line is placed which is along its width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line below it. And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. ))) )))
¶ On the method of cauterizing for pains from a fall or blow.
Chapter 48.
When there is pain in certain members from a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and medicine does not help it, then it must be cauterized with a point-shaped cautery. ))) ))) )))
And let the cautery be of every member according to its size and thinness and weakness and strength, and where the blow or pain is from that. ))) ))) ))) )))
If he is healed from the first cautery, that is good. ))) ))) ))) ))) ))) ))) "If not, then repeat on that same cautery.
Because it is the custom of these pains to pass from one member to the next adjacent one. Therefore you should follow them with a cautery until the patient is healed.
§ On the manner of cauterizing in leprosy.
Sometimes lepers are greatly helped by cautery. And especially the kind of leprosy that comes from the corruption of phlegm and black bile. When you wish to cauterize it, be mindful of this.
If the leprosy is in its beginning stage and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it does not descend or stop; and you fear for the patient that corruption may overcome his entire complexion; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two above each temple, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
And finally, place your hand with the cautery briefly on it, so that it makes a small impression on the skin and causes the scabs to detach from it; this will relieve the exhalation of thick vapors from it. Also cauterize the spleen itself as we have previously described.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible; then you must cauterize with these cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheek, and two on each side of the neck, and six on each side of the back, and a large one on the scrotum at the root of the penis and one above it in the bellybutton; and two on each shoulder blade, that is, with one on each shoulder blade and two on each knee: one on each knee and two on each elbow, and two on each wrist, and two on each side of his chest. And cauterize him on every joint among the joints of the fingers of both his hands and feet; and cauterize on each heel of his feet and on each palm of his hands.  />
And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a hot iron over the pubic bone, and another over the xiphoid process of the sternum, and another over the liver.
And know that the more you apply the hot iron, it is more beneficial and effective.
And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the hot iron as much as a healthy person would, because their body is already numb.
And the hot irons should be made according to size and shape for different limbs and joints, as has been mentioned in the types of surgical instruments.
Then treat the wounds with a poultice made from ground herbs and honey, and continue other treatments until it heals.
On the Method of Cauterizing When Someone is Insensible.
When a limb becomes insensible and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the insensible limb with hot irons, according to the size or shape of the limb.
And let your hot iron penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes it is cauterized for the numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, at the spine of the back near where the nerves that move that limb emerge; and the numbness will be removed.
But do not attempt this unless you are knowledgeable in the dissection of limbs and the exit points of the nerves that move the body.
Book Fifty-One
When a whitlow becomes old and nothing helps it from the healing arts, then cauterize it slightly with a deep hot iron according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then care for it with herb flour and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: let there be an equal part of each. Let all these be mixed together and smeared on a cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing in cancer.
When the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as if turning [a wheel].
However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
But this does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will cause an ulceration; and indeed I have seen this happen many times.
And it is more appropriate to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
On the method of cauterizing in abscesses.
When someone has an abscess and it is delayed in ripening, either because of the excess humour causing it, or because of the weakness of the patient when they are elderly and have little blood, or because of the time and the desire to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around its circumference with many small puncturing cauteries. Then leave it alone. For it will hasten in ripening on its own.
But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form: ¶ [A drawing of the cautery may be included here.]
And place it in the middle of the abscess, until it penetrates the skin. Let the cautery be from the weakest patient, so that the course of pus may be facilitated.
Then care for it until it heals.
About the method of cauterizing in malignant ulcers.
Chapter 46.
The ulcer is nothing but corruption moving through the limb, and it eats away at that limb, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see an ulcer in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then burn it much with fire, both small and large cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place where the ulcer is.
Then cauterize it on all sides until you have completely removed all the corruption and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized places, until all the scabs are removed and all corruption is eliminated.
Then treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
Therefore, if you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good. ️
And if not: then repeat the cautery on whatever remains from the corrupted places.
And the ulcer should be treated at times with sharp medicine. ️ For it arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of swifter help; and I have already spoken of its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ About the method of cauterizing in nails and warts.
Chapter 50.
Many times this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, rough substance that injures the foot.
And there are two types of cautery in them: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for the one with fire, use a concave cautery like a vulture's feather, made of iron according to the size that can contain the nail from all sides; and let it have thin edges. ️ ️ ️
Then place the heated instrument on the nail. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail, and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus. Then apply a plaster with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight. It will be uprooted from its roots.
Then care for the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
But if they do not convert and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then administer the cautery with hot water. And it is that you take a tube made of bronze, or iron, or from a vulture's feather, and place it on the nail, or althelul. Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube; hold your hand and rotate it with some pressure for a short while, so that the edge of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail; and let the patient wait for an hour over the biting of the hot water.
Then leave it, for the nail will be uprooted with its roots.
Do this one after another until you have treated all those that are on the body.
Then care for them after they have been uprooted with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in tremors.
When trembling occurs to someone from cold in the nerves, or from tertian fever, or something else, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and on his stomach a cautery.
The tremor quiets with oil cautery, and health quickly returns from cold illness.
On the manner of cauterizing according to Albathar.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes Albathar expels foul things from the body, that is, pustules which are formed from coarse corrupt matter.
Therefore, as soon as they appear, they should be cauterized with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, the end of which is set on fire. Or with the root of long aristolochia. Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. ︎
And sometimes they are cauterized with the adenoma at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner, and they do not increase; and the excess causing them is broken up, and they heal from it.
However, that should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
On the manner of cauterizing a wound to stop bleeding from an artery.
It often happens that there is bleeding from an artery cut in a wound, which occurs externally or during the incision of an aposteme, or of a member's cautery, and similar to these; and it is difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, quickly bring your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger on it. And press it hard until the blood is blocked under your finger and nothing comes out of it.
Then put a small oil cautery and several large ones into the fire, and blow on them until they are very hot. ︎ ︎
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is cut, and put the cautery on the vein itself after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the clot is expelled by raising the finger from the orifice of the artery and extinguishing the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those that are prepared in the fire.
Therefore, do not stop doing it with one after another until the blood is stopped.
And beware lest you burn the nerve that is there and another evil befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it unless by one of four means, especially if the artery is large. Either with a cautery, as we said. Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its ends contract and the blood stops. Or let it be tied with a strong thread.  /> Et scias quod hoc potest fieri in omni loco corporis, praeter caput et manibus, quoniam ibi non est uiuentem, sed mortuam carnem. Or apply to it medicines that have the property of stopping blood, and bind it with a decent bandage.
But he who applies its stopping with a ligature and tightening with cloth or the application of burning substances and similar things does not help it at all, except rarely.  /> Sed quando arteria est parua, tunc possunt abscindere sanguinem per unam de his quatuor rebus, nisi quando est in capite vel in collo.
But if this happens to someone and there is no physician present or medicine, then let him begin with the position of the finger on the orifice of the vein itself, as we have said, and very tight binding until the blood is stopped from above the wound and onto the artery. And do not remove the finger, and pour cold water of very intense cold over it until the blood freezes and thickens and stops.
And meanwhile, he should consider what is needed from a cautery or from medicine.
On Incision, Perforation, and Bloodletting in Wounds and Similar Conditions.
We have already said in the first chapter about every illness in which it is suitable to use hot iron or burning medicine, its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cautery.
And there I placed chapters from the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that it may ease the search for its questioner.
And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to know, O sons, that in this chapter there is a similarity to what is in the first chapter about cautery.
And because of this, greater care is necessary, because in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, which stands at the opening of a vein, or incision above an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision above a stone, and similar things: all of these are associated with trembling, fear, and death occurs in many of them.  />
And I warn you not to allow doubt to fall upon you, for sometimes people with various illnesses come to you in this art. Among them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and for him death is light because of the intensity of what he finds from his illness and the length of its evil. And with his illness is fear that signifies death.
And among them is one who gives you his flute and enriches you with it, hoping for health, but his illness is deadly.  />  />  />
It is not appropriate for you to agree with the one who comes to you with such a method. Let your caution be greater than your greed and your impatience. And do not presume over anything from it, unless after a certain knowledge which verifies to you the praiseworthy outcome to which it has come.
And use in the treatment of all your patients prediction and indication concerning that to which it is suitable for health.
For in this you have assistance towards gaining fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away your guidance and inspiration from you, for that is in His hand.
And I myself have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, following what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that your search for what you want from it and need may be made easier.
¶ On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Chapter I
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth or when the midwife tightly grasps the child's head without gentleness. ‌
And sometimes it happens also for an unknown cause that is not known.
And I myself have not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and every one of them that I saw died quickly because of it; therefore, it seemed to me to pass over treating it. ‌
And I myself saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled every day until he could no longer sit up because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and bone or accumulates beneath the bone on the skull (cranium).
And the operation in it, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make one slit in the middle of the head; and let the length of the slit be like two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the instrument.
If, therefore, the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then make those two slits according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides; and water sinks when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide itself from you: then you should make three slits in the middle of the head according to this manner.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture. Then bind the slits with cloths and wool. Then dress it on top with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with soft linens and ointments.
And do not stop binding the head evenly. And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture, until the part is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you should observe where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
For sometimes it is more on the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Therefore, with your incision go to where you see the abscess and the collection of water; and cut it according as is possible for you.
And take care not to cut an artery, lest blood flow out and the patient die from that flow along with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ About the Incision of the Arteries that are behind the ears. ›
Chapter 2
When someone has catarrh in the eyes or chest and it becomes chronic, and medical treatment is of no benefit, then the final treatment for that person is to cut these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary for the patient to shave his head. Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become apparent. Then let the patient tie his own neck with any of his own cloths. ‌ Then observe where the pulse of the vein is felt. And the locations of both are in the depressed areas behind the ears, and rarely are they hidden except in some people.
Then mark both locations with hot iron and cut each with a sharp razor, making the incision reach the bone: and do this across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the razor under the artery and cut it from above with the same incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' width joined together.
For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps frequently to the inner parts. ‌
But if the artery is not perceived by touch, then measure from the ear the distance of three fingers' width. Then mark with hot iron and find it down to the bone.
And that which should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will emit more or less than that. All of this according to the amount which appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery. ‌ ‌
Then observe at the wound. Then if there is anything left at the bone from the scab, cut it away so that a hot abscess does not occur. Then bind the wound with cloths of linen fabric.
Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
About the extraction of the temporal arteries.
Chapter 3
When someone has an old migraine or severe cold due to the acrid humors and heat in the temples, or when it is a severe old headache of a similar nature, and medical treatments are applied according to their methods but do not help: then we have found, through experience with these illnesses, that extracting the temporal arteries or cauterizing them, as we have described, is effective.
And the method for extracting them is as follows: let the patient shave off the hair on their temples and expose the visible temporal artery. For it is made apparent to you by its own pulse, and rarely does it remain hidden except in a few people or during severe cold.
But if it is hidden from you, then have the patient tie their head with any cloth they have; afterwards, rub the area with a rough cloth. Or apply steam to the area with hot water until it appears clearly before you. Then take the spatula that I mentioned earlier. Then use it to easily peel away the skin until you reach the artery. 🙂 Then insert the hook into it and pull it upwards until you have extracted it from the skin and made it exit completely from all the underlying layers. 😊
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it around the tip of the hook. Then cut off a section according to how much the ends can be extended and contracted without causing any bleeding. For if it is not cut or severed, the blood will not rise at all. 😊
Then evacuate from the blood vessel six ounces of blood until three remain. 😊
If the artery is large: then you must tie it in two places with double-threaded, strong silk or gut string, so that putrefaction does not rush to the wound before its healing, and blood loss may occur.
Then cut the excess between the two ties. Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the edges are cut off, using a surgical knife; so that it may stand in the place of that operation.
And this is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever or a hot constitution. Because a cautery is among those things which help to end moistures. Therefore, it is a better remedy.
And after the removal of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cloths, and fine bandages should be placed on top in a pleasing manner.
And after the dissolution, it should be cleaned with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with ointments, until it heals.
If during the operation blood flows from the artery, then quickly cut it with a cautery or fill the place with tow; and keep your hand pressed until the bleeding stops. But if you do not have either of these at hand, then place your finger over the spot until the blood clots. And soak the place with very cold water, until the sharpness subsides and it is bound as needed.
And because it is easier and simpler to extract the vein by cauterizing it with this double-bladed cautery; let the sharpness of the two blades be like an almagdal.  />And after placing the blade, burn until it reaches the second tie.  />And this operation should not be done without a ligature, lest putrefaction enter into the wound before its healing. Truly, they are much sharper than two knives. For if they were sharp like two knives, the cold would hasten to both; and they would not cut flesh with speed. Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained within them, and flesh is cut quickly; thus this work is better than any other, lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of the cautery.
And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger after you mark two places with cautery; and place both of them very hot until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein in two places so that what is between its ends is lengthened. For they do not fully coalesce with this cautery.
Chapter IV.
¶ On the care for acute and persistent tear flow from the eyes.
When tears are persistent and their flow comes from the veins that are outside on top of the head, and medical treatment with medicines does not help them, and you see the face of the sick person already redden, and he feels in his forehead a sensation like the movement of ants: and his eyes are emaciated, moist, so much so that their hair is corroded by the corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the ancients needed this operation for their treatment, and they named it a cure with the sword. 》
And you should advise the sick person to shave the hair from his forehead. Then make three equally spaced cuts in the forehead along its length; and let the length of each cut be like two fingers, and one cut should be halfway along the nose on the middle of the forehead, and the second one should be a little way from the movement of the temples, and the third one on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all the cuts be the size of three connected fingers; and have ready a piece of sponge, or many dry cloths, with which you may absorb the blood.
Then insert a thin reed with two sharp ends, the shape of which is shown next. From the incision near the temple to the second incision; and scrape off with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the flesh that is over the mouth. Then do likewise from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove that reed and insert another instrument into the first incision, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side and not sharp on the other side. And this is its shape.
And place the sharp edge towards the attached flesh with the skin, and the smooth edge towards the mouth; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut along with it all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except that the incision continues to what is visible on the skin.
Then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure. ●
And after an equal amount of blood has run out, press upon the places where the blood is clotted.
Then place a liniment of old lard into every fissure, and upon them put little poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. And see to it that no hot abscess occurs.
And on the third day, release the bandage, and administer a large quantity of infusion with warm water. Then treat it with balm ointment and the other things by which wounds are treated until it heals.
Chapter V
¶ On the treatment of acute tears and colds that come to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone has acute and painful catarrhs that are persistent: and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their sight already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and the hairs fall out from them, and there is an acute pain in the depth of the head, causing distress, and sneezing follows: then know from these signs that those humors and catarrhs do not come except from many veins. ● ● ●
And a better treatment for them is this. And it is, as you would advise the patient to shave his forehead. Then make an incision in that fissure one in the middle of the forehead or slightly to one side according to its width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right: and let the cut go as far as the mouth; and keep your hand away from the temples which move during chewing until the mouth is revealed; and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with an old cloth or with linen strips. Then bind it above with little woolen bands; and moisten the woolen bands with wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you loose that [bandage], and you see that the hot abscess is already diminishing, then it is necessary for you to scrub the mouth until flesh begins to grow there.
Then care for the patient with a drying diet that causes flesh to grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and prepare from them an ointment, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter Six.
¶ On the care of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar and things similar to them; or some sort of animal.  />
Therefore, when a stone or something of the kind that does not grow nor is added [to the ear] falls into it, expose the ear to the sun; and if you see the stone, then pour into the ear some oil of violets or sesame oil. Then administer an extraction and make him sneeze with condiments, and close the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you have placed pieces of cloth or wool around the ear and stretched the ear upward.
Often indeed it goes out with this treatment.
But if it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with Gesty, that is, fine pizigares; the shape of which is this.
If therefore it goes out with gesty, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a fine blunt hook of few folds.
If it does not go out through that, then make a tube of bronze and insert the end of the tube deeply into the ear hole, and close what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for air except through the tube: then extract with a strong exhalation.  />
Often indeed it goes out with what we have described. But if it does not go out this way, then take from hekalimbat or from visco, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught, a small amount; and place it on the end of a stick after you have wound over it a cotton cloth neatly placed: then insert it into the ear hole easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.  />  />
If it does not go out with all that we have described, then hasten to cut open, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of cutting is to bleed the sick person first in the cephalic vein, and extract from him blood according to his strength. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and find a small opening at the root of the ear in its fatty part in a depressed place itself; and let the opening be lunar-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.
Then wash the opening from your hour with speed and take care of it until it heals.
But if what falls into the ear is one of those seeds that grow and swell: then you should extract it.
But if it does not come out on its own, then take a thin, fine probe in this shape.
And apply with it the removal of that kind of seed which falls into the ear and does not come out when you think the seed is already moistened by the heat of the ear, until you break it up into many pieces: then remove those pieces with a hook or with a fine probe or with suction, as we said, for its removal is made easier.
In the case of water which enters the ear, it is necessary for the sick person to sneeze first, and already his ear has been filled with some old cooked food: and he lies down on that ear in which there is water. If it therefore comes out through it, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones the length of a finger, thin and smooth, and heat them briefly with fire, and let the sick person insert one into the opening of his ear: and he should jump on one foot, and strike the stone which is in the ear with another stone. Do not therefore cease to do this with stones until all the water comes out.
And now the water comes out so that you take one of reed or rush and insert its end into the ear: and light the other end with fire until it is almost consumed. Then take another reed and do this many times until all the water comes out: and remove it with a syringe as previously described for the stone.
But in the case of an animal entering it, if it is small-bodied like a flea, care for it as I said in the division.
"But if it is of the body's main part and is noticeable to the senses, then administer its removal with tweezers and hooks, and its resolution is easier than all those held in the ear.
"However, when treating a worm born in the ear, if you care for it with what we mentioned in division and in dealing with fumigation, your treatment is of no use; then you must look at the ear in sunlight. "Therefore, if something appears there from the worms, then remove it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
"But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula whose form is such that it is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; insert its fine tip into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; then suck with strong suction. "Do this many times until all the worms come out.
"But if they do not obey you in coming out, then coat the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said about the stone.
"But if they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the fumigations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms; and you will find it in the section on fumigations.
"And let your pouring be with which you pour oil and medicine into the ear using this instrument, whose form is depicted here. "As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below where there is a small hole, and wide above.
"So let the plunger that is within the hollow of the cannula be made neatly of iron. "And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its tip with cotton in a neat layer; then pour oil or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the reed with the cotton on top, and press it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the hollow of the ear, and the patient feels it inside; and let what is poured into the ear already be slightly heated by fire; and take care that what is distilled into it is not very cold; for medicines do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII
The care of the accidental fall of gold.
Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it has happened to some people that the fall of gold occurs in the ear canal from a wound or flesh born within it.
And this fall of gold sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which vision cannot follow; and sometimes it happens near the outer edge of the ear canal, and vision follows it.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear and which sight does not grasp is difficult to cure in most cases.
And in that which vision follows, you must place the ear of the patient in the sun and look into it; then if you see an apparent fall of gold, open it with a fine spatula, whose form is as follows: let its tip be small in width, of which one part should be sharp, and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides so that it does not injure the ear.
If, however, the fall of gold is from flesh born within the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
But if the fall of gold is deep within the ear, then take a fine, smooth wire and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal. ething.
If you feel the fall of gold with it, which the patient finds with difficulty of hearing, strive to open it with ease; and beware lest you wound the nerve of the ear.
Then place in the ear a piece of linen according to the width of the ear canal, which you have rolled in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are confident about the healing of the wound.
Or take linen and pour rose water over it, and sprinkle finely ground sarsaparilla over it, and use it.
If you see the ear already infected with boils: then you must extract the pus, and allow it to be covered with another poultice, which you will wrap in a cloth that has been made with rose oil, until the hot abscess is settled; then care for it until it heals.
If there is bleeding: then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the rest of the treatment which cuts off the aforementioned bleeding in the treatise on distillations.
About the care for sty in the eyelids.
Chapter Eight
These styes that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes wet and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them off at their roots with a scalpel. Then place powdered sulfur on the places.
If there is bleeding from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
And it is better to cauterize after the incision. For often they return when some of their roots remain. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return. )))
About the care for chalazions in the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter Nine
Often there occurs in the eyelids something which resembles a chalazion in its strength and hardness, and on account of this it is called "grain"; and it is an accumulation of thick fluid in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
The treatment for them is to observe whether the grain has developed inside it, as can be seen from the eyelid, and they move in every direction, and its nature is easy. ))) )))
Then find a slit of equal width on it. Then peel it from every part with ease until it comes out. Then hang it with a hook and cut it off.
But if its cutting is not prepared for you until after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight cut, then that harms the patient somewhat.
But if the opening is large: then join it with stitches and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. For an ointment restores it and makes it fleshy again.
And if the grain is inclined towards the inner surface of the ear, then turn back the eyelid and hang the grain with a hook, except that you need to make a cut and press it from all sides.
But if the eyelid is lengthened by the cut, this causes no harm at all. 》
Then wash the eye after removing the grain with salt water and care for the place with what makes it fleshy until the patient heals.
¶ About treating trachoma of the eyelids.
Chapter 10
Chapter X. Trachoma is a fat that forms in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and this happens especially to children. It weighs down their eyes, they get colds in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sun because tears rush into them. For this reason you see them constantly lying on their faces, and sleeping on them. Their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, which inflammation has already covered; and a visible Axirnath appears to the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of treatment is for the patient to put his head in your lap.
Then take a cloth of flax, and prepare bandages in it, and make from them a circular bandage according to the size that contains Axirnath on all sides. Then place it on top of it and press it with your fingers on every side, so that Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that wetness a small opening with an incision knife across its width, and let the cut not be deeper than that made in bloodletting.
Or you should look for the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many cases Axirnath proceeds from the cut according to the shape of a white piece of fat.
Therefore extract it with the cloth that you have put between your fingers on the outside; and you roll your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add anything into the cut so that you do not reach with the knife to the eye, and injure it.
But if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the cut, then you should add a little into the cut with ease until Axirnath proceeds out. Then extract it, as we have said.
Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and bind it with small bandages.
And there are some people who grind salt and place it on the cut so that whatever remains of that wetness is dissolved.
Then take care of it until it heals.
But if a hot abscess occurs in that place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ About the kinds of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye becomes soft, so that it blinks as it should not.
Chapter 11.
When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course and are ignored, they harm the eye and cause various illnesses such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cataracts, eventually leading to the destruction of the eye.
The treatment of ataxia of the eye is carried out in four ways. Either by cautery with fire. Or with a sharp instrument, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.  /> Or ataxia of the eye is treated by incision and suture. Or by means of reeds, as I will explain.
You should place the head of the patient in your lap. Then, with your left hand, turn back the eyelid of the eye.
If it is turned back, that is good. If not, insert a needle with thread from the lower part of the eyelid and make the needle penetrate with the thread above it, near the hair itself, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; then pull the thread upwards with the eyelid and turn it back with a rod.  />  />
Then find, within the eyelid under the added hairs, with a small spoon from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct.
Then pull out the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with wax in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and thickness of the eyelid; for it varies greatly among people.
There are some who need a large piece to be cut out of the eyelid, corresponding to the amount that is softened by the eyelid.  />  />  •
Then, when you find the eyelid space over the two lines that you have marked, begin from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct, and let there be one cut near the natural hairs, as thick as a finger.
Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then remove it completely. Then join the two lips with stitches using a fine woolen thread and a needle: clean away the blood, and make the excess threads stick together above the two eyebrows with some adhesive substances, if you wish to do so; but if not, it does not matter.
Then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days; afterwards, treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with something that dries and closes it. For the eyelid will be raised at the sealing of the wound and its joining, but it will be better afterwards.
Ancient people taught this method of treatment to Ataxmir.
However, there is concern for the patient in this, and it comes from good treatment; there is no fear in it.
And another method is also found in Ataxmir, and it is to mark a shape on the eyelid like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks according to this following shape; then cut away the excess with small scissors according to this shape, with an equal depth of cut.
But if you cannot hold the hook and it does not match up, then take a needle with thread in it and insert it in the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the greater tear duct and a second thread near the lesser tear duct; and gather the threads between your fingers with equal tension.
Then raise your hand with an equal lift: and raise the skin above which the knot is marked, as we have said.
Then bind together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it until it heals.
But if an abscess occurs at your incision or cut: stitch that abscess with a suture and similar things from the soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids as well, so that its hairs turn inward.
Therefore you must use what we have said about the incision; but the stitch is more artful for both [eyelids]. ¶ On the care of trachoma with conjunctivitis.
And it is [done] by turning back the eyelid and cutting the fissure that is inside, as I have said. Then skillfully make two cannulae or two fine sticks whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spindle. And you have already cut at the extremities of both from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then bind each one with care over that which protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tie together both sticks from both sides with a strong knot, and leave it for several days. 》 For the skin held tightly will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then care for it until it heals.
Therefore, when it is consolidated, raise the eyelid: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of the two cannulae which you should make according to this figure and measure in length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
¶ On raising hairs that prick in the eye with a needle. 》
The operation for this is as follows: take a fine needle and insert into it a fine, soft silk thread. Then you will tie the ends together with two very fine knots; and the length of the threads should be one palm.
Then prepare another fine thread under the Alinxotati in a short section, and if you wish, tie the ends together.
Then let the patient place his head on your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation can be clearly seen; for this is a delicate or subtle operation.
Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you extract a natural hair from above. ↑
Then pull the hair up to just above the Alinxotati and insert that hair into the Alinxotati; if there is one, or two, or three, no more than that.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati and the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if the Alinxotati is pulled out and the hair does not come out with it, pull the Alinxotati downwards with the thread that you prepared in it until the Alinxotati comes out of the upper hole, and you see it with your eyes; then you will pull the Alinxotati and the thread, and extract both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair with it from the natural hairs and lift it up together; or leave it until it lengthens over time, and then lift it up.
Chapter 13
When this happens to the eye, it is called leprosy.
And this leprosy is either natural or accidental.
The accidental kind occurs from the healing of a wound, cut, or cautery, and similar things.
And the manner of operating on it is that you should cut through that healing, separate its edges, and place a linen thread between them, and tie it until it heals.
And it is not fitting to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment, for if you do this, the leprosy returns worse than before; rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, embrocation with water in which althea and flax seed have been cooked, and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil. And wrap a linen thread with it and treat with it.
And your treasure of treatment is to strive by all means that it does not heal according to the first form.
And this operation which we have spoken of is nothing but a correction of the leprosy, so that the form of the place does not entirely return as it was before.
¶ On the treatment of leprosy which occurs on the lower eyelid and is a wrinkle or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Chapter XIV
This leprosy which occurs below is what is truly called leprosy. It is both natural and accidental.
And the accidental kind occurs from a wound, or cut, or cautery, and similar things. 
And the way of operating on it is that you should take a needle with a double thread, and dip it in ink, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel. If therefore the figure of the eyelid returns as is fitting, it is good.
And if not, take a thread and place it in the slit, and turn the eyelid with it. And find two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two slits be from the two corners of the incision, until they meet and form a corner; until when they come together the figure will be like this figure, which is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh in the amount that its sharp side is below that which follows the eyelid. Then gather the separated parts: or sew them together with a thread of wool.
Then treat them with what we have said about softening ointments and linens until they heal.
And if ectropion occurs from the slit or suture, or from cautery, then it is necessary to cut a flat slit under the eyelashes, even as has been said before. Then separate between the two lips with a linen thread, as we have said.
And the summary of the treatment for ectropion, whether it is above or below, is that this operation should be performed according to the preparation from the type of ectropion.
For indeed it [ectropion] is of many diverse forms; and a skilled craftsman prepares his ingenuity in whatever way is possible for him, so that he may bring the figure back to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
Chapter XV.
¶ On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents its natural operations.
Therefore, you should insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula that is not sharp like the incision spatulas but rather slightly blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the spatula, lest it injure the eye with its sharpness. And let your incision be as if you were excoriating that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the entire adhesion heals.
Then pour salt water into the eye and wash it with water, or distill onto it from a sieve made of crushed gum dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day, use a sieve and bandages until it heals.
¶ On the incision of the nail and the prominence of the tear gland.
Chapter XVI
Know that the nail is in two ways. Either it is nervous and similar to a dry sponge, thin. Or it is not nervous and similar to frozen white moisture; when this is touched with iron or you try to catch it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not stick into it.
And both types do not begin except from the larger tear gland, until it gradually extends to cover the vision and prevent light and eye movement.
And the way of operating in its incision is: so that the patient places his head in your lap. 》 》 Then open his eyes, and raise his eyelid with your hand. Then gather the nail with a small hook, and extend it upwards. Then take a needle and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, ox, or cow; and let the thread be strong, and slightly double the end of the needle, and place it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and remove the skin with the hair on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you sew it with the hair to its very end.
Then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal gland with a fine scalpel or small scissors: and leave the natural lacrimal flesh as is, so that persistent tearing does not occur from the incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with a thread, as we have said. Then it should be scraped with a soft scalpel of this shape.
And take care that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane, lest it cause a tear and pierce the pupil.
Then after the incision, put some crushed salt or a sieved powder of ziniar into the eye, and leave it until another day. Then care for him with what is necessary until he is healed.
If the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medications and heals as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a thin, soft, and weakly sharpened scalpel of this shape. And scrape the surface of the nail with great fineness. If you see that it becomes rarefied and fragmented, and a furrow is impressed upon it, then distill into the eye from an hourglass made of tin or red glass, or crushed salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Then repeat the same procedure until all of it is removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye; then leave that [procedure] alone and treat the abscess until it heals.
Then repeat the procedure with the furrow until it heals.
If the prominence of the tear-producing flesh causes great harm in the eye, hang it with a hook and cut off a portion of it; but do not finish the incision, so that the flow of tears may not be interrupted.
Then distill into a red glass or tin hourglass until it heals.
§ On the Incision for Alguardenic and the Flesh Born in the Eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes a red fleshy substance is born in the eyes of some people, either composed or placed over [the eye], until it covers the pupil or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rosebud.
And the procedure for this is also that the patient should place his head on your lap. Then open his eyes and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or tweezers. />
Then cut the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel. And be careful of the eye, so that you do not harm it during the procedure; and let your incision by which you cut [the flesh] be either with a spatula, as we have described in the incision for a fingernail; or with small forceps, with which asebel is collected, according to its form after this chapter.  />  />
When your incision is complete and all the white of the eye has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or sprinkle red powder into it, and similar things from corrosive medicines; and place a cooked egg-white over the eye to secure it from hot inflammation.
If some of the white of the eye remains and hot blood prevails in you and you fear a hot inflammation, then leave the eye alone and treat it with that which settles inflammation.
Then repeat the treatment on it until it heals.
And do similarly with the flesh that happens to be in the eye from this type.
However, it is necessary that a stranger should not undertake the treatment of any weak eye from natural or accidental causes by operating with iron, and you should not interfere in any of these operations until you see that this member can bear that operation.
¶ On collecting Sebel (pus) from the eye.
Chapter Eighteen
Pus consists of red veins that spread over the eye and hinder its vision; and with the passage of time, they weaken the eye.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye with pus is strong and has no other illness except for pus; then collect the pus from it.
And it is necessary that you instruct the patient to place his head on your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your judgment; and let the hook be of fine wire, as shown in this figure [image not provided], or let there be two hooks on one body, as shown in this figure [image not provided].
Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they dissolve; and be careful not to injure the eye with the ends of the tweezers.
And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation very much: so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have cleared it out, then distill into the eye either green or red: so that its sharpness may eat away what remains of the barley seed.
But if you are not able to remove all of it at that time, then bandage the eye with something that will alleviate the pain of the eye; and leave it for some days until its pain is relieved: and protect it from a hot abscess; then repeat the same process over it according to the same method until it heals.
And this is the shape of the forceps.
About reducing a broken nose back to its normal position.
Chapter 19.
Doctors call the broken nose a fistula, which they treat with a cautery or with a sharp burning medicine, as was mentioned before in its description.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it unless you pierce over the abscess at its origin and draw out all the moisture and pus that is in it until the bone is exposed.
Therefore, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument whose shape is like this. ■
And its name is "rasp for the head.
Let it be made from Indian iron and let its head be round like a needle, which should be studded with the studs of a file or the studs of a fine rasp; and place it on the corrupted bone. ■ ■ ■
Then turn it between your fingers and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is scraped off; and do this several times. ■ ■ ■
Then restore the place with dry astringent medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates and flesh grows in it, and the course of pus ceases: and it remains for forty days without renewing or becoming inflamed, and no accident occurs in it: then know that it has already been healed.
And if not, then there is no wisdom in it, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this form.
And it is that you uncover from the bone with a second iron or with a sharp medicine: and when the opening has been uncovered, then take a trepan of this form, its end being iron and triangular: and its handle be a slender pyramid up to the extremity, as you see.
Then place it over the very opening: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand a little from the eye. Then turn your hand with the trepan until it penetrates the opening, and let the patient feel it: because he finds air escaping from it when his hand is placed over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent and drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Therefore when flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter that was flowing out to the outside returns to the nose: it is therefore easier for the patient.
¶ About the Reduction of an Eye's Prominence.
Chapter XX.
When an eye protrudes with all of itself and no harm or decrease occurs to the sight, then it is necessary that you release the patient; then phlebotomize him: afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place over the eye a plaster made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla. Then bind the eye above with many fine threads on top of the plaster.
"And the way to make poultices is this: take soft cloths, many of them, and fold each one into four layers. Make many of these. Then place one on top of another according to the amount needed for the eye. Then bind them together with a hard cloth, tightly.
"And repeat the procedure with cupping glasses, using suction without scarification.
"Then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
"However, if the ligature becomes loose again, then it must be tied tightly. Then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we have said.
"If you see that the eye has already returned to its normal state, then it is good. If not, then repeat the treatment with plasters, poultices, bandages, and cupping glasses until it heals.
"Chapter on Incising the Conjunctiva.
"Chapter 21.
"When a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva and a lump protrudes from the eyelid like a grain of barley, disfiguring the face, and one wishes to incise it, then the procedure is as follows: insert the needle at the root of the eyelash from below to above.
"Then insert another needle with double thread from the lacrimal part and make it penetrate; then leave the first needle in its original position.
"Then cut the place of the double thread and tie with it the part of the eyelid around the needle; and bind it tightly.
"Then remove the needle and place a cotton pad soaked in egg white over the eye; and leave it until the thread falls out with the eyelid.
"Then care for the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.
"And sometimes the eyelid is bound all around with a ring of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Then it should be pierced with a fine needle that reaches to the depth of the eye, and let the moisture of the white run out, and let the eye sink down, and immediately enter; then bind it until it heals.
About the treatment of alcomnatum.
Chapter 22.
This illness, which is called alcomnatum, is nothing but a discharge that accumulates in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not itself.
And the way to treat this is by having the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Then take his head with your hands on both sides and move it until you see the discharge reach below his eyes. Then it should be fixed and not move downward, and the eye should be released; and the patient should see things as he used to see them; and if it does not move downward, you should know that it is water.
But if the descent of the discharge does not occur as we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands. ️ Then take a fine needle and slightly puncture the skin where the conjunctiva joins with the cornea, near the edge, until the discharge comes out.
When it comes out, then drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or water that has already been boiled with fenugreek and honey. Then treat it with the rest of the remedy until it heals.
§ On the treatment of water descending into the eye, or cataracts.
Chapter 23.
Now we have spoken about the types of water according to its division, and which is appropriate for piercing, as the declarative and explanatory speech has stated; then take that same [water] according to health.
Then it is necessary for you to have the patient sit between your hands, facing the light, near the sun; and cover his healthy eye, and bind it very tightly; then with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one. ️
Then take with your right hand the collyrium, if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Then place the tip of the collyrium near the cornea according to the thickness of the radius, in the same whiteness of the eye where the tear duct is smaller; then press the collyrium with force: and you turn your hand with it until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye: and feel that the collyrium has already reached the empty space.
And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the collyrium be to the depth, the measure of the space which is from the pupil until the end of the blackness; and this is the cornea of the eye. For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Then place the collyrium until it reaches the watery part. Then press it downwards once after another.
If therefore the water immediately comes out, then the patient sees that immediately on which he opens his vision, and the collyrium is in his eye.  ()
Then wait a little while. If water comes out, then put it aside a second time, except that the collyrium emerges.
When it becomes fixed and does not come out, then remove the collyrium with ease: and you slowly turn your hand.  ()  ()
Then dissolve some of the clear salt crystal in water: and wash the eye with it from within. Then place outside the eye all cotton or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bandage the sound eye with it.
But we, and those who are of our time, place on top of it ground barley with egg white.
If the collyrium does not obey you at the entrance into the eye because of its hardness, since it is made from humans whose eyes are very hard: then it is necessary that you take a small stick, which is called Albard, and this is what it looks like.
So grasp that same membrane with it, and do not thrust your hand through the opening; there is nothing to do but to make a way to the almagda, a subtle place.
Then introduce the almagda as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a decently made bedchamber in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room; and let him be kept from all movement and coughing; and give him food by which his nature is soothed; and let him not move his head at all to the right or the left.
And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day.
Then unbind it in that dark room, and test his vision; and make him look at things. Then rebinding it until the seventh day.
And it is not right to do this at the time of the operation or immediately after the incision; but rather it should be avoided, because water rises quickly through a powerful gaze.
But if a hot swelling occurs, then it is necessary to unbind the eye before the seventh day; and treat it with what soothes the swelling until it subsides; then let out its vision, and place on his face a coverlet that regulates his sight under it for several days, while he remains in that dark room.
Then let him go forth from the house gradually, and turn to his affairs.
And know that a student is not exempted from vision many times; then indeed he may venture upon the operation.
And indeed a certain man from those of Alarcos has come to us, who said that at Alarcos an almagda was pierced through which water is sucked out.
Truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new. 》
And these are the forms of species from dough, so that it may stand on it who does not know them.
Let them be made properly from air: and their extremities should have this same triangular subtlety, and an acute tip.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
¶ On the care for flesh born in the nose.
Sometimes in the nose, various kinds of flesh are born, one of which resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from this is cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark in color; and from it is gentle flesh, not dark in color.
Therefore, in that which is gentle from these fleshes, not deceitful nor cancerous, it is necessary for you to make the patient sit between your hands opposite the ground, and open their nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then draw them outwards, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin sharp spatula on one side until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
But if something of it remains whose cutting is not possible; then scrape that with one of the fine instruments easily, until nothing remains from it. But if blood prevails over you, or a hot aposteme occurs; then oppose it with what is necessary: or it is from malignant apostemes, then hurry to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the fleshes are removed.  /> But if the patient's nose bleeds frequently and persistently, or there is a severe headache, or fever, or other harmful symptoms appear; then it is necessary for you to stop these, before treating this disease.
Then after the incision, vinegar should be poured into the nose, and water, or wine. But if the nose is opened, and moisture comes out of it as far as the palate, then know that he is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that inside there is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then you should insert a linen thread with some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot the length of a finger or less. The patient will then make one end of the thread enter the nose with a bone, or whatever is possible for him to make similar to an awl: and he should pull on his olfactory until it reaches the skull, and exits over his throat.
And often boys at school do something similar to this Atom; and it is an easy thing for one who wants to.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that exits from the nose and the other that remains inside the nose. Then the flesh is cut with a saw along with the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now together with the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread and place a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment into the nose after washing away the blood. Do this for three days or more until the remaining ointment has completely eaten away the flesh.
Then at the end of the treatment, place a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals.
If, however, it needs drying treatment, use this one.
For making a head-purge, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make this from silver or bronze, similar to a small lamp, open like a shell, and its channel similarly.
And if you want to make it as a closed tube, make it like a reed.  />
And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purge should be full and open; it should have a handle at its end with which you hold it when heating oil or whatever liquid substances you wish in it.  />  />  />
Chapter XXV.
A swelling often occurs at the tip of the nose and increases over time, until it becomes unsightly.
And because of this, it is necessary that at its first appearance you cut into it and completely remove the whole thing. Then place on the spot either a hot iron or a burning medicine to take its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider whether it is stony, hard, dark in color, and painful; do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant tumor.
For many times I have seen that whoever cuts into such a tumor has suffered great harm from it.
And if the tumor is soft to touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be cut into entirely, then evacuate the patient and cut into it without fear or dread; and treat the spot with that which dries and contracts until it heals. 😊
Chapter XXVI.
About stitching the nose, lip, and ear.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, an operation on it is of little benefit, except in some people.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood; then bring together the edges of the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of separation have already separated and each part has become healthy; then it is necessary to scrape off all parts that are visible from their skin until they bleed. 😊 Then bring the two lips together with stitches and tie them; and sprinkle on them powdered blood of a dragon and ground frankincense; and place on these powders a piece of diafinicon plaster and another of the consolidating plasters; and leave it tied for two or three days. 😊 ️ Then dissolve it and replace the medicine; and let it go until the threads are cut off by themselves. Afterwards, take care of him with ointment until he is healed.
The method of suturing is to join the continuity with a needle, as we have described in the case of the abdomen, or to join it with thread, as I have taught you.
Chapter 27.
¶ On the Extraction of Lip Nodes.
Indeed, many people develop hard lumps inside their lips, similar to grains of barley, and some are smaller while others are larger.
Therefore, you should turn the lip inside out and flatten over each node; then hang it with a hook and cut it from all sides.
Then fill the place after cutting with powdered barley until the blood is cut off.
Then wash it with vinegar and scrape the place where the astringency is until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 28.
¶ On the Incision of Flesh Above the Gum. ➤
Often there appears on the gum a growth of flesh which the ancients called abulus.
Therefore, you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing the pus or blood to run out.
Then place on the site powdered barley or other astringent and drying powders.
If the flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it, for it will not return after cautery.
Chapter 29.
¶ On the Filing of Teeth with Iron.
Sometimes there form on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, rough, foul growths which blacken and turn yellow and green until corruption reaches the gum, making the teeth foul.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and his head on your lap, and shave the tooth and its pulp, in which you see cortices and something similar to sand: until nothing remains of them, and do likewise with the blackness, the greenness, and the yellowness, and other things until they are cleansed.
Therefore, if what is in them is removed at the beginning of the reasoning process, that is good; and if not, then you must repeat the reasoning process over them on another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally your effort achieves what you desire.
And know that the tooth requires razors of diverse forms and many shapes according to how it is prepared for your operation; therefore, because the razor with which the tooth is shaved from below is different from the razor with which the space between the teeth is shaved, according to other forms.
And these shapes of the razors should be prepared for you, as you see.
Chapter XXX
On the Extraction of Toothache
It is necessary to treat the tooth for its pain with all skill and be slow in extracting it. For it is not a matter of replacing its place when extracted: because it is a sublime substance. But when there is no excuse for extracting it, then if the patient is forced to have the tooth extracted, you must firmly secure and establish with yourself the aching tooth.
For often the pain deceives the patient and makes him think that it is in the tooth and he extracts it; then the pain does not go away until a weaker tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen this in the practice of bloodletting.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is firmly established with you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, on which there is some power, until the gum is dissolved from every side; then move the tooth gently with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little until you shake it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the patient's head between your knees so that you have held it well enough that it does not move; then draw the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it beneath it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did first.
If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth; and tie it with a fine string, so that it does not break at the time of your squeezing on top of it with forceps.
And you must act very carefully with scarification all around the gums from every side greatly.
And be strong so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the patient with greater evil than his first pain.
And beware of doing what ignorant bleeders do out of haste and their own boldness in removing it, besides administering that which we have narrated.
For many times they cause great diseases to befall men, which are very difficult to break and all or some of its roots remain; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed this.
Then let it be rinsed after its extraction with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If bleeding occurs from the site (for this often happens), then take some of zegi and fill the site with it; and if not, cauterize it if zegi does not benefit you.
The tips of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should be long, and have a short, thick handle so that they do not bend when pressed on the tooth with them; they should be like you see with thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not give way to themselves or bend; they should have short tips, and be made of Indian iron or well-made steel, straight at the tips; and in their tips there should be teeth, some fitting into others, and binding with a decent, strong constriction.  />
And sometimes they become like the beak of a bird called a stork, and are very narrow.
Chapter 31.
About the extraction of teeth, and the removal of broken jawbones.
When something remains after the extraction of a broken tooth, then you should place a cotton pad with butter on it for one day or two days until the area softens; then introduce to it tweezers or forceps whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called a stork. This is the form of forceps.
Let their tips be made like a file within, or like a chisel.
If it does not yield to you with these forceps, then you should make an incision on the root and expose all the flesh; then introduce a small lever whose form is this.
Let it be short of tip, somewhat thick; and let it not be brittle, so that it does not break.
If the root comes out with it, that is good; and if not, you must help with these other instruments whose forms are these. ¶ Adhuc alii instrumenti faciuntur de ligno, et non franguntur.
The form of the first is triangular at the tip, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form is a thin triangular tip.
And with the other instruments and tools that have been mentioned earlier regarding teeth.
Also help with this instrument that resembles a large hook of this form, having a twisted triangular tip with some thickness so it does not break; and let it be not brittle.
And know that the instruments of teeth are many; and likewise the other instruments are not counted, and an expert craftsman, subtle in his art, finds by himself an instrument according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate.
Because of the variety of kinds of diseases about which the ancients did not speak of instruments.
If, however, the bone is broken from the jaw or other bones of the mouth, or if it becomes rotten; then explore over it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned for root extraction, and help with this hook, whose shape is this:
Let there be in it something thick gradually, so that the bone may be held or grasped with it, and not slip away, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
But if there is only a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape it from its rottenness, and care for it, until it heals.
Chapter 32.
About the binding of protruding teeth above others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the form becomes ugly through that; and especially when this happens to women and girls, namely whores.
Therefore, you should consider. For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not placed, or its binding or filing is possible; then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this:
It is similar to a small beak and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your cut, by which you cut it, be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that another tooth may not be disturbed.
But if it is protruding and ready for filing; then file it with an Indian file, whose form is this: ›
It should be all of Indian iron, and its handle of very small points, as the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth may not be disturbed or fall out; then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
If it is a tooth, from which a piece breaks off and injures the tongue, then it must be filed evenly until the roughness of that break is removed, leveled, and smoothed so that it no longer injures the tongue or corrupts speech.
Chapter 33
Concerning the extraction of teeth using golden threads.
When a concussion or injury occurs to the front teeth from a blow or accident, and the patient cannot bite down on what they are eating so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been effective, then there is a method for securing them using a golden thread. Because silver turns green and rots after several days, but gold never changes.
And the thread should be of medium thinness and thickness according to the size between the teeth.
And the manner of this extraction is as follows: take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave it with both ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or several, until you reach with the weaving to the other healthy tooth on the opposite side. Then repeat the weaving back to where you started; and bind with finesse and wisdom until it does not move at all; and let your binding of the thread be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip out.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and join them together and turn them back with a probe; and hide them between a healthy tooth and a loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain thus bound until it heals.
But if it loosens or breaks, bind them again with another thread, and they will remain secure in this manner for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the extraction of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return to their original places after the accident, and are retained as we have described, and remain there; and this is done only by an skilled craftsman, wise and experienced.
And sometimes a bone from an ox is prepared; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in its position, by which the tooth is supported and fastened, as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Sometimes this ligament that occurs beneath the tongue is natural, present from birth, or it may be acquired, resulting from an old healed wound.
And the procedure is to open the patient's mouth wide and lift up their tongue; then cut through that nerve-like ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its constriction.
But if there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is due to an old healed wound, then insert a hook into it and cut through its width until you reach the ligament and free the knot. ›
And be careful not to create a deep cut in the flesh, lest you cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Then wash the site of the incision with rose water or vinegar or cold water.
Then place a linen cloth under the tongue for the patient to hold every night, so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, then apply powdered alum to the site. But if the bleeding is too much for you to manage, then cauterize the site with a suitable cautery iron; then treat it with the usual care until it heals.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
And the procedure is to open the mouth of the patient in sunlight and examine the abscess.
If you see that it is dark or black in color, hard, and the patient cannot feel it, then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.  
And if it is inclined towards whiteness and has moisture, then place a hook into it, and cut it with a thin scalpel, and free it from all parts. If blood overcomes you during your procedure, then place crushed zea on it until the bleeding stops; then return to your procedure until you extract it with all of its contents.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and care for it with the remaining appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ Of the treatment of an abscess in both tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat and the glands, which are similar to glands that appear externally; they are called tonsils. If you treat them with what we have said about incision and they do not heal, then consider them.
If the abscess is hard, dark in color, and has little sensation, then do not touch it with an iron instrument.   
And if it is red in color and its base is thick, then do not touch it even with an iron instrument, fearing a flow of blood; rather, leave it until it matures.       And then either you will pierce it or it will burst on its own.      
And if it is of white color and round, and its root is fine: then it should be cut.
And the operation on it is this, that you should consider before its operation, if the aposteme becomes quiet after a complete quietude, or is diminished by some diminution: then indeed make the sick person sit before the sun, and his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the servant receive between his hands, and press down his tongue below with an instrument, of which this is the shape.
Let it be made of silver or bronze, which should be as fine as a knife.
So when you press with it the tongue and the aposteme is shown to you, and your sight falls on it: then take a hook, and insert it into the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you should also pull some of its tunics with it.
Then cut it with an instrument, the shape of which is as follows. It resembles scissors; however its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly against the other's edge. Therefore ensure that it is made of iron of Indus, or steel tempered by immersion in vinegar.
But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a scalpel, the shape of which is as follows.  /> It resembles a knife, however its extremity should be sharpened on both sides. Let it be sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same form of incision.
Then after the incision, let the sick person rinse with cold water or with vinegar and water.
But if bleeding occurs, let him rinse with water in which the bark of oak apples or myrtle leaves and similar astringents have been boiled, until the flow of blood is stopped; then treat him until he is cured.
And sometimes there arise on the throat other abscesses besides the two tonsils. Therefore, cut those according to what I said about cutting the two tonsils evenly.
And indeed I myself have already treated a woman for an abscess that had arisen in her throat, which was drawing toward blackening, scarcely any sensation remained, and it had nearly closed the throat: and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and it had already prevented her from eating food and drinking water; and she had almost reached death if she had remained for one day or two.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent forth two branches, until they came out through both nostrils.
Therefore I hastened and inserted a hook into one of them. Then I pulled it, and with it was drawn out a large piece.
Then I cut off the piece where it had been caught at the nostril opening.
Then I did the same to what came out of the other nostril opening.
Then I opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue; and then I inserted a hook into the abscess itself; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood flowed out. Therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food.
I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period; and the abscess would come forth in place of what I had cut, until it was stretched out too much along with her.
Therefore, I incised and cauterized the abscess in the throat.
It stopped from growing; then I left her side, and I do not know what God did with her after that.  /> 120.
¶ About the incision of an abscess on the lip.
Chapter 37
When the catarrh descends to the mouth and forms a swelling that is long, it is called "perpendicular." And if it is thick and round at the bottom, it is called an "uvula.
When it is treated with what we have said regarding division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot swelling has quieted from it, and it is subtle, then you should cut into it.
And if from it a round swelling has formed, which does not have length, and is red or dark-colored or black, and does not have sensation, then you should avoid cutting into it. For in this there is danger for the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner that I have said concerning its whiteness and length, make the patient sit before the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument whose description has preceded. Afterwards, insert a hook into the uvula and draw it down; then cut it with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned for the incision of the two tonsils. ︎
And you should not cut from it except that which is added beyond the natural limit without additional growth.
For if you cut more than this, you will harm the voice and speech.
After the incision, use what we have described for the incision of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, then you should use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear or dread.
And the method of cautery for it is not except with sharp water, and this is that you place the patient's head on your lap. ︎ ︎ ︎ Then press his tongue with the instrument which I have mentioned. Then take from the water which I have mentioned to you in the chapter on cautery and make a cup not yet extinguished with it, and place it not too thick nor too thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is thus.
Let there be a depression at its end where the medicine is placed, like the hollow of a spoon.
And put the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and let the sick person lie on their side, so that the saliva runs out of their mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing from it descends into the throat and harms them.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you should do this on the wound for half an hour until you see it become blackened and the bite of the medicine has calmed down.
And if you wish to use a bandage, wrap it around the end of the spoon and pour the medicine over the bandage, then insert the spoon with the bandage into the wound until the bandage sticks to the wound.
Do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cautery of the wound. Then leave it; for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to renew the medicine, renew it; and after cauterization, clean around the wound with a bandage soaked in butter, and cleanse it with what remains of the medicine around it; and then rinse with cold water.  />
And let it be scraped externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Therefore, this method of treatment is more wholesome than cutting and further from danger.
And sometimes the wound is also cured with something finer than cautery and cutting; for it is cured with fumigation, in this way. Take calament, hyssop, oregano, rue, saffron, chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs; and gather all of them or some of them in a pot and let them be soaked with vinegar and boiled; and the pot should be well daubed with clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which should be placed a concave instrument in this way.  />  />  />
Let it be made of silver or copper, and its tip, where the seed is, should be inserted into the mouth of the patient until the vapor rises to the top over the tube, until the mouth becomes very dark.
Then repeat this many times on the same spot until it dries out.
And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess formation. For it often increases the swelling, and you should not do this unless the abscess is cooled down.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and put the shell of an egg on its tip so that the patient's mouth does not burn, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with safety.
¶ On extracting thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone or a fishbone gets stuck in the throat.
Therefore, you should extract whatever is visible from the throat after pressing the tongue with an instrument against the sun, and it will be revealed to you what is inside the throat. ➤
And whatever does not appear and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food settles in the stomach. For perhaps the object will come out with the vomit.
Or the patient should swallow a piece of nap, or a lettuce root, or a dry biscuit; or he should take a small piece of soft sponge, tie it on a string, and then swallow it. ➤ When it reaches the place where the bone or thorn is, it will be pulled out, and then it will come out.
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use an instrument made of lead in this manner. ➤ ➤
It should be somewhat thicker than the radius and have a curve at its tip, which it can easily insert into its throat; and it should have its head raised upward.
And let it be careful not to touch its epiglottis, lest coughing occur; and let it expel with it bone, or spine, or let the physician insert his hand into it.
But what the patient introduces is better; on account of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached. And let it push downwards or draw its hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity prepared for it, until it comes out.
¶ On the Extraction of a Leech.
Chapter 39
When a leech is treated with what was said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not work, then observe in the patient's throat before or after the sun, after you have pressed its tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate tweezers appropriately.
If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow reed and insert it into the patient's throat until almost to the throat; then insert into the hollow of the reed a heated iron with fire. Do this many times, and let the patient abstain from water all day long.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water and open his mouth into it; and rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and move the water with his hand one hour after another. For the leech, as soon as it feels the water, will fall out.
But if it does not come out with what we have said, then fumigate the patient with fleas or with a pan using the instrument that I told you about for fumigating the neck.  ·
"For this happens often, because it falls off.
"And the manner of operation in fumigation is this: take a pot with living coals and fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, on which there should be a hole in the middle; and place the end of the instrument into that hole.
"Then throw the fumigation onto it, and let the patient place his mouth on the end of the tube and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. "For the leech will immediately fall off.
"If it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times.
"And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty foods, garlic, and do not drink water.
"It is therefore necessary that it should come out with this treatment.
"And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat when it falls upon it.
"It is similar to tongs, as you see; except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat. "And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, which has the roughness of a file; and when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
"Chapter on the opening of abscesses, their incision, and general care.
"Chapter 40.
"There are many kinds of abscesses, in many forms, as their remembrance comes to mind, that is, one and one in this book; and they differ in their opening and incision in two ways.
"One of them is due to the nature of the abscess itself, and because it contains moisture.
"And the second way is due to the places where it occurs in the body.
Because an aposteme occurring in the head is different from an aposteme occurring in the anus; and an aposteme occurring in a fleshy place is different from an aposteme occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment based on its location.
And of the apostemes, there are some that should not be pierced unless after the maturation of the pus in them and its completion; and among these are those that should be pierced while they are still fresh and do not mature according to their time.
Just as are the apostemes that are near the joints.
Because when an aposteme occurs near a joint and its duration extends until it putrefies, the pus around it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint; therefore, it is a cause of closer contraction of that limb.
Or the aposteme is on a principal member; for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either the member or through that principal member.
Or it is near the anus; therefore pierce it while it is immature: and you should not pierce a fresh aposteme that has not completed its digestion, except one that is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the inner parts of the anus, and become a fistula, or end up with something that does not heal.
You should know the time of perforating a matured aposteme according to its completion: and it is at the relief of pain, the subsiding of fever, and the reduction of redness and pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the aposteme; and other signs.
And you should make the perforation in the lower part of the aposteme and its more prominent swelling; and let the perforation be along the length of the body if the apostemes are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of the arms, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those that are reflected upon, go with a hole through that membrane.
When the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better to leave its perforation until its ripening is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
For if you perforate it before that time, the course of the pus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much filth and stench, and perhaps its edges will harden, as well as its depth.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body, as needed; or according to what the part needs.
And you should administer a small perforation in small abscesses and a large perforation in large abscesses; or many incisions similar to the size of the abscess.
And among the abscesses, there are some where it is necessary to cup the skin and cut it when it has become like a cloth, and its end has reached that which is already dead; as happens with many abscesses, such as with buboes and carbuncles.
And among them are those which are cut by a three-cornered incision. And one of these is the incision in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an abscess of the groin.
And among them are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered; and similar ones from the other incisions.
However, in an abscess that does not have a head, such as are the mild and superficial abscesses, it is necessary to perforate it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And when the abscess is thick and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, do not hasten to draw out all the pus at that time; rather, draw out some of it from it. Then fill the abscess until another day. Then extract some of the pus again.
Do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old person who has reached decrepitude, for the vital spirit of the living being is often released with the discharge of pus, and perhaps the patient dies and you do not perceive it.
Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, through which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and be mindful. Therefore, if the abscess wound is small or flat-cut, then apply a linen cloth or an old cotton cloth. And if the abscess is large and there are many openings from the perforation, then it is necessary to insert a cloth into each opening until they meet.
And if you cut off a part of the skin from the abscess or hollowed it out in its circumference, then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton or as when weaving a cloth or shaving linen hair dry and bind it until the third day.
Then throw it away and treat it with what is necessary from an ointment, until it heals.
However, if bleeding occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar after the cloth has been soaked in them; and place it on the site of the bleeding many times.
However, if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to apply a diet, treatment, and powders which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
However, if it is during the winter and the site of the abscess has many nerves, then it is necessary to pour warm wine and oil over the spots and place them on the sites.
And if it is summer, and the places are fleshy, then you should put small cloths soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold. When it is the third day, as we have said, then you should release the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its treatment whatever is suitable for it, until it heals.
This, therefore, is what is necessary for the universal knowledge of treating abscesses.
According to the second half of the division, I have already spoken about every abscess, how it is the way to its treatment individually by chapter.
Chapter XLI.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the kind called nodules, which are enclosed by membranes that are their sheaths: as if they were little pouches of a hen.
And there are many kinds of these.
Some of them are fatty; and some contain a moisture like mud; and some contain a moisture like kneaded bread or porridge; and others similar to these, and there are those which are hard as stones.
And in the incision of all of them, and their removal, there is no fear, provided that at their incision the artery does not cause a counteraction. ¶
And the operation in their incision is to examine them with an instrument, the form of which will come later, which is called a probe, until you know what they contain.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a longitudinal incision with a superficial incision in this manner.
And begin the incision from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is emptied, then strip off the membrane that contains this moisture, and leave nothing of it behind. ¶
"For it often returns if something remains of it.
"Then dip the cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; and if not, in water with salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day. "For this will eat away what remains of the abscess.
"Then repeat the Egyptian ointment on the same cotton a second and third time, and if you need it, continue doing so until you are confident that nothing remains of the abscess; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
"If the abscess contains a fatty nodule, then cut it according to this form, with an incision in the shape of a cross; and place the hooks between the edges of the incision, and strip it from all sides; and strive with your skill to extract the membrane that contains it.
"But if a vein opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
"And similarly do this for an abscess if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, as we have said.
"And the incision on a stony abscess is easier because it contains little blood and moisture. "And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses that occur in the head of some men, with which there is no moisture at all.
"This is because I cut into an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess to be like a solid and hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if anyone hit it with something thrown at it, it would hurt them.
"In other abscesses that occur in the head, besides these, namely the abscesses that occur in children's heads and at the roots of the ears, let the incision on all of them be a superficial incision.
"However, place the perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of blood is relieved towards the lower parts.
Then take care of it with what suits them in treatment.
§ On the incision of swellings in the neck.
Chapter 42.
These swellings often occur in the neck and under the armpits and groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body.
And among those that occur in the neck are one and many; and they arise from each other; and every swelling from them is within its own proper tunic, as it is with the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have mentioned.
And there are many kinds of these swellings. For some of them are stony; and some contain fluids; and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, when you see one that has a good arrangement and feels good to the touch, whose color is close to that of the skin and moves in every direction, and which is not attached to the nerves of the neck or jugular vein or artery, and it is not deep: you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part of the body to the lower part along the line b to the line g, and excoriate it from all sides. And spread the two lips of skin with hooks, or with many hooks if you need them, as we have said regarding the swellings of the head, and gradually remove it.
And it is important to take care that no vein or nerve be cut.  />
And let the knife not be very sharp; so that it does not give you trouble with the cut or disturb the patient, and so that you do not cut what is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein or artery and it hinders you from operating, then place ground zegi or certain powders that dry up blood in the wound, and bind the wound, and leave it alone until the swelling of the aposteme calms down and the wound softens; or it begins to want to become putrid.  />  />  />
"For blood is cut off by the skin, so return to your operation until you complete it.
"Then, with your index finger, check if any other small strophuli remain; cut them out and clean them.
"But if the strophulus has a large vein at its root, you should not cut it off from its root; rather, you should tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
"Then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. "Then tend to him.
"If the entire strophulus is cut off, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately after ensuring that there is no remaining excess.
"But if you see that there is remaining excess due to the size of the strophulus, then it is necessary for you to intend to cut its root and extract it; and apply the suture as we have said.
"And for those strophuli that contain humors, pierce it with a superficial puncture so that you may know the place of its maturation; and make the puncture from what follows below in the body, as we have said.
"Then apply a poultice with ointment and similar substances after the puncture to corrode what remains of the corruption until you see that the wound is clean; then tend to it with regenerative flesh ointment until it heals.
Chapter XLIII
"About the incision of the epiglottis due to a swelling occurring in the throat.
"The ancients spoke of this incision on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is their written account.
In those having synanche, it is necessary to avoid cutting the epiglottis, as it does no good; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the esophagus, it is necessary to use cutting of the epiglottis to avoid death from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section by width, in what is between two circles, such that the section is in cartilage, not in bone: and this place is suitable for cutting because it is free from flesh, and blood vessels are far from it.
If the doctor is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook. Then let him incise the skin until he reaches the esophagus; avoid blood vessels if he sees any.
Then let him cut the cartilage as we have described; and it is indicated by the phlegm that comes out from there, along with its rupture, and the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When the hour comes that you fear suffocation, bring together the two lips of the skin wound and close it alone without including the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Said Albucasis. The summary of this discourse that we have described is not except when they see that any one of these abscesses has blocked the throat of the sick person: and the sick person has been raised up to death, and his breath wishes to be cut: they go to cutting the epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe over the wound with some breath, and he may be saved from death. And because of this, they have ordered to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days or thereabouts; then therefore they order to suture the wound and treat it until it heals.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is this: a maidservant took a knife and sent it into her throat, and cut off a part of the lung's canal with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning as if she were dying.
Therefore, I exposed the wound, and I found blood that had come out of it to be small. So I became certain that she had not cut a vein or an artery: and air was coming out of the wound.
I hastened therefore, and closed the wound, and cared for it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maidservant except for a hoarseness in her voice; and after some days she returned to better health.
Therefore, I say that in cutting the epiglottis there is no fear.
On Cutting a Throat Hernia.
Chapter XLIV.
This tumor called a throat hernia is a large tumor, according to the color of the body, and it occurs very often in women.
And it exists in two ways: for either it is natural or it is accidental.
Certainly, the natural one has no intellect.
The accidental one, however, exists in two ways: of which one is similar to fatty knots. ‌ And the other way is similar to a tumor that occurs from the knotting of an artery. ‌ ‌ And there is danger with it, and one should not presume to approach it with a knife unless it is small; and you should test it and examine it with an intromitter. If you find it to be like a fatty knot and it is not attached to any veins, then cut it as nodules are cut; and remove it with whatever it contains of pus, if there is any pus; and if there is not, then explore all of it. Then care for the place with what is necessary for healing until it heals.
Chapter 45.
About the incision above the knuckles.
There are many kinds of knuckles, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division. And it is necessary for me to explain here the difference between a knuckle and a protrusion, since there is some confusion about this.
I say therefore that when a protrusion occurs, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the boiling over of the excess matter ceases and the process of decay is completed; then the fever and heat subside.
But with a knuckle there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and they are contained by the sac called sifachin, which is their own pouch, and it matches the color of the body. And their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a fig, larger or smaller. 》
And they are in two types: either fleshy, or they contain moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a knuckle, it is necessary to examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called "intromissum", as its form will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
And the way to investigate all knuckles and tumors is as follows: take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part of the tumor that you find; and then slowly turn your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. Then place your hand according to the size of the tumor. 》 》
Then withdraw the intromissum and observe what comes out in its path.
If therefore liquid oozes out, whatever its color may be, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said for other tumors.
And if moisture does not exit after insertion, know that it is fatty; therefore, make a cut above it in the shape of a cross as I have taught you: suspend it with hooks and easily remove the skin from every part: and keep kistin over it, if possible, to extract it safely with a knot.
If the kist (i.e., abscess or swelling) bursts during the operation and it is not possible to extract it safely, for often this happens; then remove it in pieces until nothing remains of it.
For if some small or large part remains, the knot (i.e., the abscess) will return again according to the most.
But if it overcomes you and some part remains; then fill the wound at its completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and tie up the wound, and place a warm poultice on top of it; and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Therefore, if it is a large knot (i.e., abscess), then either its two lips or care for it with that which cures flesh.
But if a contrarily pulsating or non-pulsating vein is present to you; then hasten and fill the place with crushed henbane seed, and leave it tightly bound for two days or three until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood calms down: then return to cut that which remains from the knot.
Chapter 46.
¶ Concerning external instruments for cutting and piercing.
OF THESE are the forms of the probes, and there are three types.
From these is a large one, from these is a medium one, and from these is a small one.  />
They should be made of square-ended steel, fittingly, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.
And these are the forms of Experiences, and yes, that is, piercing: and one of them is called beris, which means, piercing: and there are three kinds of it.
Of these, indeed, there is the large, and the medium, and the small.
They are suitable for investigating apostemas, exiturae, fistulas, and buboes due to what is between the bones among them.
And others are made round, smooth, and blunt, like the large needles with which cushions are stuffed, from citrinum, or bronze, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those made from citrinum.
And experiences are also made from black lead, which are suitable for investigating fistulas, whose cavity is a reflection, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness and those reflections.
And there are again three kinds of them. Because from these [types] there are the long ones, and the medium ones, and the short ones, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowing.
The form of knives, and they are of many kinds.
Because from these [knives] there are the simple ones, that is, with one curvature; and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And from these [knives] there are blind knives; and they are of three kinds.
And from these [knives] are hooks with two curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and from these are hooks with three curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and apostemas are cut and scraped; and they are of three kinds, because from these there is the large one, the medium one, and the small one.
Their tips, which are used for cutting, are sharp; the tips of others are not sharp: and they are not placed this way except to bring benefit during the scraping of nodes due to fear of incising a vein or nerve; and so that through them the patient may heal and find temporary relief from the burning sensation found in the scraping of an aposteme.
They are made of bronze and resemble a ray; with it, one makes alcohol. At the tip, there is a hidden spatula-like point, and it runs to the inside or outside when desired, as you see.
The shape of the spatulas that are hidden among the fingers during the perforation of apostemes; and patients do not notice them; and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small.
The shapes of the ventoses with which the flow of blood is cut off; and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small.
They are made of bronze or brass, round and somewhat long, as you see; and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these two kinds of ventoses, large and small, so that you can quickly cut off blood when needed, especially when the medicine is not present.
Nevertheless, you should not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy areas such as the thighs of the legs, hips, arms of the shoulders, breasts, belly, groin, and similar fleshy, moist places.
And sometimes they are made into other small instruments resembling chestnuts according to their shape; with them blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or during the incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
Chapter XLVII.
On the care of the nipples in humans which resemble the nipples of women.
Sometimes the nipples of certain individuals swell at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to ejaculate during sleep) until they resemble the nipples of women, and they remain disgustingly prominent.
Therefore, if one is repulsed by this, it is necessary to make an incision above the nipples in the shape of a lunula, according to the following form from line b to line g. Then, remove all the fatty tissue. Then fill the wound with the flesh-forming medicine. Then join the two lips of the wound with a stitch and care for it until it heals.
If the nipple inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to make two incisions on each of its superior sides in the shape of a lunula, each meeting at the ends of both, so that one line contains the other, according to this form from line b to line g. Then, remove the skin between the two lips and take away the fatty tissue. And administer what we said about stitching and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
If you do not complete the incision as required due to the discomfort of the patient or excessive bleeding, then it is necessary to fill the wound with cotton soaked in a caustic ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fatty tissue. Then care for it until it heals.
¶ On the perforation of an abscess that occurs under a ticklish spot.
Chapter XLVIII.
These abscesses that occur under ticklish spots are of the hard kind of warts, which contain a pouch, and among them are those which contain moisture.
"Therefore, those that contain humors should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form: from line b to line g. When everything in the abscess has been evacuated from pus, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until another day.
Then remove the cotton and scrape with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
If the abscess is of the type called "nodules" or "strophulus," then cut over it as we said for strophulus, equally.
If the wound spreads to the point of emitting pus, then apply a cautery to it, as we said previously.
Chapter XLIX.
§ On the incision of an abscess that occurs due to artery and vein.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, then very often an abscess occurs from there; and similarly, this happens with veins as well, so that an abscess and swelling occur in them.
And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or vein are: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and deeply seated in the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating sound.
And that which is due to a vein is round and situated superficially in the body.
And incision over this abscess is harmful, and especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and many other parts of the body; and it is very dangerous. Therefore, one must avoid treating it with a knife, and those that are also in the extremities or head must be avoided.
So, for those that occur from the swelling of the opening of an artery, make a cut in the skin along its length. ⋅ Then open the incision with hooks; afterwards the artery, and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Then introduce a needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side; and constrict the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two temporal arteries.
Then puncture the place that is between the two ligatures with a probe until all the blood flows out of it and the abscess dissolves.
Then apply a treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments for it until it heals.
But if the abscess is due to a vein section, then you should hold as much of the abscess with skin as you can in your hand. Then introduce a needle under the place which you have held in your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side. Then bind the abscess with the same ligature as you bind the grape ligature, from both sides with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread may be drawn out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the place of the first needle; press and tie your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle until what is inside comes out; then cut off the excess skin and leave what has been bound from it.
Then place upon it a little piece of cloth which you have soaked in wine and oil. Then apply a treatment that is made with linens and ointments until it heals.
Chapter 90
¶ On the abscess which occurs from twisting of nerves.
As an aposteme occurs in arteries and veins, so also does it occur in nerves; this happens to them from a blow or from excessive labor and similar things; and it is most common in the places of the joints, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move; and it is a grave aposteme.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is generally painless in most cases; but when pressed with intensity, the patient feels a sensation like numbness.
And the aposteme is not deep within the body but rather under the skin; and it moves to all parts of the body, except that it does not go forward or backward, neither to the front nor to the back.
Therefore, when such an aposteme is found in the joints, it should not be pierced with a knife. Perhaps then contraction may occur.
However, if it is found in the head or forehead, incise the skin with a razor. If then the aposteme is small, hold it with forceps and cut it off from its root.
And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and scrape it away; afterward remove it, and close the wound with sutures; and care for it until it heals.
Chapter LXI
¶ On the incision of an aposteme that occurs in the abdomen.
It happens to some people many times in their abdomen and other parts of their body that small lumps appear, which are called fungal, because they resemble fungi.
Whose root is delicate and whose head is thick, and their lips are turned back.  /> ¶ De sectione thelili, quod accidit in ore. And some of them are small; and others grow very large.
And I have seen a man, and in his abdomen there were two lumps, which were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them; they were white, with a small root, and their lips turned back, and they were moist, and moisture always flowed from them.  /> ¶ De sectione thelili, quod accidit in ore.  /> Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.
I cut them open and found that one weighed nearly 10 and 8 ounces, the other almost 6 ounces. The procedure for cutting into them is as follows: first observe if the patient is moist and has a whitish-lilac color; if so, they are humid and have delicate roots. In this case, cut the patient with a broad spatula, and have cauterizing irons ready in the fire.
Often indeed a great deal of blood is expelled when cutting it open; if the blood overwhelms you, hasten to cauterize it then.
If you see that the patient is cowardly and afraid of the incision with iron, then take a neatly made lead thread and tie it around the area as we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the tying of the lead. Do not cease from tying the lead whenever it prints on the area, until it is cut off and falls away by itself without labor.
If, however, the area has thick roots, then there is some danger and fear in cutting it open; especially if it is in the abdomen.
However, it is possible to cut half of it open. Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then care for him until the wound heals.
And beware of presuming to cut open a black-colored area with little sensation and foul appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess, and I will remember Cancer after this.
Chapter 52.
¶ About the care of the navel projection.
A navel projection occurs for many reasons. ■ Or from a tear, which is on the abdomen; and from it comes out either an intestine or intestinal content, as happens with other tears. Or from blood that flows from a vein, or an artery, as mentioned before. Or from constricted flatulence within it.
If it is due to a fistula and the discharge of pus: then the color of the swelling resembles that of the body, and it is soft, without pain; and its position varies. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, then its position has a greater difference, as we have described. Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it increases greatly at the entrance to the bath, and causes great labor.
But if it is due to moisture, it is soft; then when you press it with your hand, it does not disappear nor become constricted, nor does it increase.
If it is due to blood, then with these signs the swelling appears dark red, as if from a cliff.
But if it is due to dead flesh: then the swelling is heavy, thick, hard, and remains in one quantity.
If it is due to flatulence, however, then its touch is soft.
And the operation in it is, that then you should consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or flatulence; then you must abstain from treating it. For there is danger and fear in it, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke about swellings due to an artery and vein.
But if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestines or pus: then you must advise the sick person to hold his breath and stand straight. Then mark the signs with cautery all around the navel.  ?> Et praecipe ei, quatenus non uadat ad balneum, neque respi-scant, aut lauant uenter suum per diem. Then instruct him to lie on his back between your hands over his back. Then encircle it with a wide bandage around the navel over the place you marked with cautery. Then extend the middle of the aposteme upwards with a large hook. Then tie it tightly around with thread or silk cord; and let the knot be alexostate.
Then open the middle of the extended aposteme above the ligature. If you find that it has already been captured by the ligature, then remove the alexostate and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine back inside the abdomen; and if you find the zirbum, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
But if the contrary is an artery or vein to you, then bind it very tightly. Then return to your procedure. And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them; and insert the two needles into the circle you made around the aposteme in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Then draw the aposteme taut in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave it until the extended flesh becomes rotten and falls off by itself; or cut it when it softens and rots.
Then treat him with whatever is necessary from the salves until he heals.
But if the protuberance of the navel is of fleshy growth or of moisture therein, then you should make the aposteme concave, as we have said. And you should draw out the blood, or moisture, that you find in it.
Then treat him with what solidifies the place.  •
Chapter LIII.
§ On treating CANCER.
We have already spoken about the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines; and we must be careful not to use iron for its treatment, lest it ulcerate; and we spoke about cancer generated in the womb and the caution necessary for its treatment.
The ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, such as in the breasts or thighs and similar parts of the body from which it can be removed entirely, especially if it is small and just beginning, ...
... when it becomes advanced and large, one should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it; nor have I seen anyone before me who has reached that point.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you should precede and resolve the patient with black bile several times. Then perform a bloodletting on him if you find him with clear signs of fullness.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he will be located for the operation.  />
Then place hook-shaped instruments into the cancer that fit it. Then hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to the investigation, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but press the places and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible there among the instruments.
If, however, the flow of thick blood from the cutting of an artery or vein causes difficulty for you, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops. Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
¶ On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter Forty-Four. We have already narrated in the division of the types of dropsy, how water is collected; and all the signs of every type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with the iron is only the sole type of ascites; and one does not approach with iron the type of tympanites; nor the type of hypersarcus completely, for that is fatal.  /> ♥
"When you have been treated for this kind of hydropic tympanites with medicines, and your treatment does not take effect; then be aware. "For if the patient has already become weakened, or there is another infirmity besides hydropis, such as coughing, or loosening of the belly, and similar things; then beware of treating him with iron, for there is danger in that.
"But if you see the patient is of abundant strength and there is no illness with him except hydropis alone; and he is neither a child nor an elderly person; then the manner of operation on him is that you should lift the patient, standing between your hands, and the assistant behind him should press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the abdomen.
"Then take a thorny probe of this shape. "Let it be of two sharp ends, long, with a sharp tip like a probe. "However, let there be some gradual narrowing in it, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way to the intestine and injure it.
"Then be mindful. "For if the hydropic growth comes from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel by three finger widths, straight down to above the pubic bone.
"But if the cause of the hydropic growth is due to liver disease, then let your incision be on the left side of the navel by three finger widths.
"And if the cause of it is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it should not be an incision on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the discharges do not flow to that weak place.
"Then pierce all the skin with the instrument. Then insert into that incision, and lift your hand with a spatula between the skin, and scrape, as if you are removing it: and let the amount removed be the size of a nail or about that.
Then pierce with the scalpel until the spatula reaches the empty place, and it is the place of water. Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this form. And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver or bronze or brass, smooth and polished; at its lower part is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side; and its end is cut in the manner of cutting reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately comes out above the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in one hour a medium quantity.
Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it in one hour, perhaps the patient will die from a weakening of his vital spirit, or a syncope which approaches death will occur to him.
Indeed, evacuate from it according to the power of the instrument, and according to what the patient's condition indicates to you by his pulse and by its goodness.
Then remove the instrument, and keep the water.  />
Which is to say, because it is immediately retained by the skin which keeps the opening that is above the scalpel; about which I have said, that you should pierce through it in this manner.
Then repeat the process with the instrument on the next day, if you see that the patient can tolerate it; and also extract from the water a small quantity.  />  />  />  />
Do this for several days without fear and guard against error; until there is only a little left from the water.
If you fear for the patient and release much water from him, then care for him with a burial in warm sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait until he is thirsty; and care for him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water, as I have related before.
On caring for infants born with their bladder outlets not yet perforated.
Chapter LV.
When some infants come forth from their mother's womb and the outlet of their bladder is not yet perforated, or it is narrowed, or displaced.
Therefore, one should assist immediately with its perforation upon birth using a very fine probe in this manner:
Then place a thin lead plug in the opening and tie it; hold it there for three or four days. ️
When he wants to pass urine, remove it, and let him urinate. Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which accumulates there will not permit it to close.
As for him whose opening is narrow, he should be treated with lead as we have said, for many days, until it becomes wider. ️ ️
Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed. That is to say, because in those who are born, the opening is at the tip of the penis; therefore he cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis with his hand above. Nor can he have intercourse for this reason: that the semen cannot reach the vagina in its proper way; and it is a very shameful condition. ️ ️ ️
And the manner of treatment for this is that the patient should be turned over onto his back. Then extend the head of the rod with your left hand with great extension, and cut off the head of the rod from the place of the foreskin with a needle or a sharp spatula, like cutting a reed, or as you might scrape something, so that its middle comes out similar to the head of the rod: and so that a hole falls in the middle where it should.
And beware of bleeding during your operation. For this often happens. Therefore oppose it with something that stops the bleeding, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ Concerning albathers that occur on the foreskin and head of the penis, and their corruption, blackening, and adherence.
Chapter 66.
These albathers frequently occur on the penis, and there is a foul-looking lump of flesh.  />
And from this, one is malignant, and the other is not malignant.
Therefore, you should suspend the non-malignant one with a fine hook and cut it off until you have completely cleaned it out. Then place a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment over it. Then care for the affected area with diaphanic ointment until it heals.
But if the albather is malignant and foul-looking, then you should apply a hot iron after cutting it open and removing it.
But if the albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of it is inside the foreskin while another part is outside, then you should first remove the inner part of the albather until it heals, and only then care for the outer part. For when you care for both parts together, the foreskin will not heal properly and may even be cut off.  />
And similar blackening and corruption also occur on the testicles and the foreskin.  /> ・ Therefore, you should scrape off everything that has already blackened and wants to rot or has already rotted.
Then cover it with a mixture of honey, pounded flour of peeled grains, and sifted crushed herbs.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if there is bleeding, then apply a lunar-shaped cautery in this manner.
For a cautery is helpful for two purposes at once: to stop bleeding and when a wound starts to rot.
If the tip of the rod is eaten away and destroyed within an hour, then you should insert a lead pipe into the opening of the penis so that the patient urinates onto it.
In the case of adhesion of the foreskin to the tip of the penis, this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for it. And sometimes the adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore, you should scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the bond is broken and the tip of the penis is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish them accurately, then you should scrape a little from the tip of the penis and from the foreskin. This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may be quickly pierced due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the tip of the penis with a thin, damp linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.  />
Then treat it with styptic wine until it heals.
Chapter LVII.
About cleaning infants and treating their errors.
Circumcision is not a disruption of continuity, as are other wounds; however, since it is the result of our action, our will, and its use is especially for children, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and an easier path leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws, and there is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
Which means that I have found most craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor, and with scissors; and they use caustics, bandaging with thread, and incision with a nail.
And I myself have already proven all these methods and found none better than cleansing with scissors and bandaging with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often slips away. Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower one remains; thus it is necessary to proceed with an incision to cut the other one, causing future pain. And with cleansing done by caustics, that is, the finger used by shoemakers, the cut of the end of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its hole.
However, in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and ruins your work; and the skin of the child is short by nature, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this.
But cleansing with scissors and bandaging with thread have shown me good results; because scissors are appropriate for the cut; therefore, the sharpness that is on top is like the sharpness that is below. When you press your hand, two sharp points are aligned, and one cut is made at the same time: and a compression similar in shape occurs, enclosing the skin of the stick from all sides, with which no mistake is made at all.
And the proper method is to have the boy estimate, especially if he is among those who can understand a little, that you do not do anything except tie a thread around his stick: and let him go until another day.
Then have him rejoice and be glad in every way possible for you to do so, since he receives his understanding. Then have him stand between your hands prepared to the right height, and let him not sit; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy sees them absolutely not, nor anything of the instruments.
Then insert your hand into his stick and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the stick comes out. Then cleanse it because it has accumulated filth in it.
Then tie the marked place with double thread. Afterwards, tie a little below the first bandage.  • The translation is now complete. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the lower bandage securely, and cut between the two bandages. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the stick.  • The translation is now complete.  • Thank you for sharing this text. Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top; and on the powder a cloth in which an egg yolk boiled in rose water has been spread out, shaken with good fresh rose oil: and leave him like this until another day: and care for him with the remaining treatment, until he is healed.
The form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows:
The two ends are numb, and they meet; let not a nail branch out through them. And the length of the two sharp points should be equal to the length of the two handles evenly.
However, a fallacy occurs in cleaning because perhaps the entire inner skin or part of it slipped away at the incision.
Therefore, you must stretch it from your hour with your nail before swelling of the place, and cut it according to its equality.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
But if three days have passed and the part under the rod remains swollen with inflammation, then leave it until the hot boil settles, and remove it easily, and cut it according to how it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod. For it will not harm him.
Take care of it with what consolidates a wound from the powders that we have spoken of in the chapter on powders, and if it is cut through the skin beyond measure and extends to the upper parts, this too will not harm him.
Take care of it with what we have said until it heals.
Chapter 58
On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
The retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction made by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born from these and similar things that we have mentioned among the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine does not dissolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be on his knees bent forward. Then let his feet be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as possible for him. It is therefore considered with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone toward the back: why urine is released.
And if it does not dissolve with what we have said and the matter is severe upon the patient, then it is necessary for you to administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose form is this. Let it be made of silver, let it be fine, smooth, concave like the quill of a feather in fineness, long like one and a half palms: at whose head let there be a fine cannula.
And the manner of the exit of urine through it is that you take a doubled thread and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off any excess from the wool with scissors, but insert it into the cannula with force, as alzar.
Then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white: and make the patient sit on a seat, and probe the bladder, and its rod with moist oils and olive oil and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the rod easily until it reaches the root of the rod.
Then double it above from the part of the navel.
Then press the syringe within until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has now reached an empty place: and this is not done according to this order except because the passage through which it goes is one of twistedness.
Then gradually extend the thread with wool. For urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out and make the urine run through the path of urine: and repeat with the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and let the patient find relief.
The quality of enema administration with a clepsydra.
Chapter 59
When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood freezes within it, or pus accumulates and compresses it, and it becomes necessary to instill water and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed. And in it there are three openings: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave place, where that which drives it is located, should be according to its quantity without adding anything until when something is drawn with it from the moisture, moisture is attracted; and when it is driven out, it expels that thing to a distance: as the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.  />
Therefore, when you want to project moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture and draw with it that which drives it upwards; for moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then insert its end into a tube, as we have described in the syringe. Then drive out the moisture with that which drives it; for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
The form of a subtle enema with which the bladder is enemaed.
It should be made of silver or gilt bronze; its tip should resemble a small alcam [a type of container] and underneath it there should be a pouch into which the string falls.
Then take the bladder of a ram and place in it the moisture with which you want to enema the bladder. Then bind it between two strong folds with double thread, and gently warm that moistness over a fire.
Then insert the end of the enema tube into a pipe, afterwards place your hand on the bladder with an appropriate amount of moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it from all its roundness. Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they are rolled. Then roll up the circle like a sausage; after you put into it what you want from moistures, oils, and waters.
Then bind it to the instrument; and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
¶ On the Extraction of Stones.
We have already spoken about the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I have explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and one in the bladder, along with its symptoms: and I have spoken about a stone that can be removed by hand or incision; this is a stone properly formed in the bladder. And there is also a stone that becomes lodged in the urethra. I am now explaining it clearly and concisely.
Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most commonly occurs in children.
And among its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder like water in its subtlety; and in it appears white sand, and the patient grinds his penis and struggles with it, and often it hangs down. Then it becomes erect, and with it the anus is open in many of them.
And the cure of boys is easy until they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in old men. But for young men it is of medium difficulty, since its cure is between that and the other: the larger the stone, the easier the cure; but if it is small, the reverse is true.
Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema that removes all the feces from his intestines; for this itself sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone at the time of examination.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved to a lower place, so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes leap from its high position.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his hips, so that the entire bladder may slope downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him from outside.
If you feel a stone in the area, then hasten immediately to make an incision over it.
But if it does not fall at all under your touch, then it is necessary that you wash the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger, if he is an adult; and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you wish to make an incision; and order one attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and another to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand; and with his other hand to remove the skin that is under the testicles from the place of incision. 》
Then insert the scalpel, cutting with it, whose form is this. And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, toward the left side of the buttocks: and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the external part of the incision may be wide and the internal part narrow, according to the size of what is possible for the egression of the stone from it, no more.
For perhaps the finger which is in the anus presses the stone toward the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know that if the stone has angles and edges, its passage is difficult on account of this.
And if it is smooth, like a hazelnut, and round, its exit is easy.
Therefore, to the one who has angles and edges, add into the slit.
But if it does not come out thus, then it is necessary that you invent above it; or tie above it with a thin thread whose end is like the moon, which binds above the stone and does not escape from it; or that you insert under it a subtle instrument of curved end.
But if you are not able to above it, then widen the opening a little. If something overcomes you from blood, cut it with a thread.
But if the stone is more than one, then expel first the large one toward the mouth of the bladder. Then cut over it. Afterward, expel the small one after that; and do similarly if there are more than two.
If it is very large, it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision. Because to the sick one of two things happens: either he dies, or there occurs to him a continuous dripping of urine; therefore, because the place does not heal at all.
Truly, administer an expulsion of it, until it comes out; or make incisions in the fracture with scissors, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed the operation, then fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood; bind it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose-colored oil and cold water, to quiet a hot abscess.
Then place the patient on his back with his head raised, and do not remove the bandage until the third day. When you unbind it, wash the area well with water and much oil.
Then treat him with diahafincan ointment and basilicon ointment until he is healed.
But if a hot abscess or similar corruption occurs in the wound, as if blood coagulates in the bladder and blocks the flow of urine, and this is known by the excretion of blood with the urine. Therefore insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood. For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply every remedy appropriate to the treatment until it is healed.
And throughout all the hours of the entire treatment, you should bind two bandages and make them tight, because of the medicines that are placed on the area.
If the stone is small and lodged in the flesh of the penis, preventing the flow of urine, then treat him with what I have mentioned before you reach the point of cutting. For many times have I been saved from cutting by this treatment; indeed, I have proved it.
And you should take a perforator made of steel, whose form is this: with three-sided point, sharp, fixed in wood.  \\
Then take a thread and tie it with that thread under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the thread with ease until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and turn the perforator in your hand little by little within the stone, trying to make a hole through it until you have made it penetrate from the other side.
For urine is immediately released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside part of the thread. For it breaks and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
But if this cure is not prepared for you because of some obstacle from it, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone. Then cut on top of the stone in the same thread between the two ties. Then extract it. After that, untie the knot and clean the congealed blood that forms at the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone except that it should not return to the bladder; and another thread above, except that when the thread is untied after the stone has come out, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for you to lift the skin upward when you tie the thread above, so that it returns to its proper place and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
¶ On the extraction of a woman’s stone.
Stones are seldom generated in women.
But if it happens to any of them that a stone is formed, then the cure is difficult and is prevented by many reasons. ¶ If it were possible for women to have their urethra opened with an incision, this would be beneficial; but because they are ashamed, they do not permit it. ¶ And if you wish to treat them with cautery or with cupping, it is difficult and not beneficial, nor can you draw out a stone from the bladder of women with a perforator or with any instrument, for their urethra is narrow and their genitalia are weak; therefore, there is no benefit in this. ¶ But if you wish to treat them with medicines, we have written about these in the chapter on the treatment of stones with medicines.
One of them is that the woman might be a virgin.
And the second is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician when she is chaste or has a husband.
The third is that you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the stone: therefore it needs a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
If necessity compels you to do this, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician who knows well; and she is found rarely.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a chaste physician who is skillful and present with a midwife well-versed in women's matters or with a woman who knows part of this art: make her present, especially to her, so that she may do all that you command her from the examination concerning the stone.
First of all, she should see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus and search for the stone.
If she finds it, let her constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and examine the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and press it with a good pressure.
If she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the bladder's opening towards below with all her strength until it reaches the pubic bone.
Then she should cut above it at the midpoint of the vagina near the pubic bone on whatever side he prepares for her and feels the stone in that part; and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting under it; and let the first incision be small. Then let him insert a ray upon that incision.
Then let him insert a ray upon that incision. If he feels the stone, then let him add to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone exits from it.
And know that there are many types of stones. From these are the small and large, the smooth and rough, the long and round, having branches.
Know therefore its types, so that it may be indicated to you concerning what you wish.
If therefore blood overpowers you, then add ground barley to the place and hold it for one hour until the blood is cut off.
Then return to your procedure until the stone comes out: and prepare with you from the instruments that I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may assist in your procedure through them.
But if the flow of blood overpowers you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that was cut: then place powder on the spot and hold it with a proper tightening bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it. For perhaps the weakened woman will die. Then care for the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood is calmed after a few days and the place becomes foul, then return to your procedure until the stone comes out.
Chapter LXII.
¶ Concerning the incision upon a hydrocele.
A hydrocele is nothing but a gathering of moisture in the white membrane called the sifac, which lies beneath the skin containing the testicle: and it is named the sifac.
And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg until it becomes hard: and this is another egg, and it lies between the white membrane that we mentioned and the skin of the testicle: and this occurs rarely. ›
And indeed the origin of this vein is from the weakness that occurs in the testicles; therefore, this material flows to them. And sometimes it happens due to a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For indeed its color is inclined toward a yellowish hue, or it is blood red, or dark and dusky, or watery white, and the one that predominates is this last kind.
And the signs by which you can know where the collection of water is are these: For if it is in the white sac which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round and a little longer, like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in its own little bag, then the swelling is round like part of an egg, and because of this a man thinks that there is another egg there.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sac, then it falls under the senses.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the swelling with the square tool, whose shape has been mentioned before.  />  And if it is red and dark as we have said, or yellowish or white like milk, it is healthy; but if it is black, it is corrupt. According to what comes out in the wake of the probe, judge that which is between them.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment with fire, it is necessary that you instruct the patient that he should be bled if possible, and observe that his body is full.
Then let him lie on his back on something elevated slightly, and place many cloths under him.  />  After that, cauterize the swelling with a red-hot iron, large enough for this purpose, until the blood flows out; then let the patient be bled as we have said, until he sees his body becoming empty.
Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right side, so that he can stretch his leg toward one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and toward the pubic region of the abdomen.  />  And let him hold the leg in this position until the patient is healed from this ailment.
Then take a sharp knife, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise in the middle, almost to the comb: and let the incision be straight along an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white spermatic cord; and remove it carefully, or be cautious not to cut it; and let your incision, with which you remove it, extend more from the side where the egg is suspended. And examine it delicately together with the incision according to how much you are able.
Then pierce the filled spermatic cord with a wide puncture, and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the spermatic cord upward, without touching the skin that surrounds the testicles: and cut the spermatic cord in whatever way is possible for you to cut it, either completely or piece by piece, especially its thin side. For if you do not carefully examine [it], there will be no security that the water does not return in the incision.
But if the egg comes out of its skin during your operation: then when you have filled the incision of the spermatic cord, return it [the egg]. Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Then treat it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg due to other blackness, then it is necessary for you to tie the vessels that are the suspension, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with its suspension, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it as we have said.
But if the water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part equally as you did with the first one.
And if it seems to you that it should be done in one operation, then do [it]: then clean the blood. And introduce wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions; and place another piece of wool that you have soaked in wine and oil on the outside, and spread it over the two testicles and the navel; and put doubled cloths on top, which are made from felt, and tie them on top with a cord that has six [strands], following this form.
Then let there be taken two cloths and they should be moistened and filled with wool carded as follows: and the ends should be made which are pressed with cotton or wet wool; and they are bound together at the waist of the undergarments; and one end reaches over the buttocks to the back, and the second reaches toward the pubic region; and two ends go below the two hips, and two other ends go above the two groins, and all is tied together at the waist of the undergarment.
And sometimes this hernia is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the incision. It is done by taking a fine surgical scalpel and cutting through the skin of the testicles; and it is heated as we have described until, when the white thread containing water is exposed, then take the cautery in this manner.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce through it with the cautery, and it is heated until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch the thread with pincers and burn it with a heated fine scalpel, and cut it as much as you can until you remove all of it.
And be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
And know that this procedure is safer and causes less bleeding, and it is better than the procedure with an incision.
But if during the hour of incision or the hour of cauterization there is a hot abscess or bleeding or anything else causing difficulty, then it is necessary to treat whatever is causing the difficulty with an appropriate treatment, as was mentioned before.
If, however, the patient is fearful and does not expect this operation due to its horror, then perform the perforation as I have described it: and it is so.
When it is confirmed to you through what we have said about the indications that the vein is watery, then you should make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a broad probe; and make the incision along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Then place a bandage on the spot and bind it; and let it remain until the remaining water flows out; then care for him until the wound heals.
But if there is resistance to the discharge of water at the time you pierce it, and this is not because the vein is obstructed, but only because a white membrane is causing obstruction at the opening of the wound and preventing the water from exiting, then you should insert a feather into the wound or an instrument with which the water of dropsical patients is drawn out, whose form I have described earlier; or delay the operation on the wound for a while.
And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or about that time. Therefore, when it accumulates again, then it should be pierced in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
Chapter LXIII
¶ On the treatment of fleshy veins.
Know that in the incision on this vein there is fear of causing death in many dispositions. ️ Therefore, it seems to me that its release is safer for this reason.
And I remember the procedure on it and the appearance of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the body from which testicles are composed, and this happens for many reasons, namely. ️
From an excess of sharp or bitter fluid that is discharged onto the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the appearance of the swelling matches the color of the body, and it does not cause pain; this is a serious swelling.
And perhaps it is a stone-like swelling, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens from the knotting and swelling of the arteries, as has been previously mentioned; or from the swelling of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from them by swelling of the arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the swelling when you press it with your fingers. And it should not be touched at all.
However, that which is from swelling of the veins does not ooze anything when pressed with fingers.
And it is possible that incision can be made on this type and on other flesh; it is as if you were to cut the skin of the testicles. Then extend the egg upwards and extract it with a white sponge; free the spermatic cord from the vessels and tie the vessels; cut the spermatic cord after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is solidified with those native tissues, then it is necessary to pull out the egg and cut into it.  />
And if there is an adhesion between some part of the sponge or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free that entire adhesion and cut through it with a round incision.  />  />
But if there is a growth of tissue at the site of the adhesion behind it, then it is necessary to cut through all of it and extract the egg, as we have said.  />  />  />
When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter LXIV.
§ On the care of the hands, which is with the tendons.
The tendons are a swelling wrapped in some wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with the softening of the testicles; and it becomes difficult for the patient to move, exercise, or walk.
And in the treatment of this disease, there is fear from the memory of what preceded it.
Indeed, we must say that the operation on it should be done according to what was first done.
I say, therefore, that you should have the patient sit on a raised seat. Then push the scrotum downwards. Then hold the skin of the scrotum with your fingers, together with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another assistant hold it and stretch it strongly.
Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel across the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Then peel it from all sides, as we have told you in the removal of the temporal arteries. ›
Then pierce it with a needle that has two threads, and tie the thread first at the place where the tendons come together; and tie it again at their end. › › Then cut it with a straight cut along the length of the body, and remove what has accumulated from foul, corrupted moisture.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, so that there will be strength to generate pus, until the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall away. For it is not a harm in this way.
But if the tendons are affected in all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the vessels; so that the egg may not be deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and waste away or dry up, and there will be no benefit from them.
Chapter 65.
The care of the rectum and intestines.
The outcome of this rectal issue is from a cut, which occurs in the scrotum extended over the abdomen at the groin from the navel.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles? And this rupture is either from the scrotum or its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the scrotum. ‌ It is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and there is an abscess of equal depth: because the scrotum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is from a cut in the scrotum, because at its beginning it causes a sudden and severe pain: and there is an abscess that appears near the surface of the skin: and this is due to the exit of the intestine and its course to the outside of the scrotum. ‌
And sometimes it exits with the intestine and the testicle: and this is called rectal intestine and testicle: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes feces runs into the intestine and is retained there: and with it is the destruction of the sick person: because it causes a severe pain, especially when pressed upon.
And in treating these types of illness with iron, there is fear: therefore one must be careful to avoid this error.
And the method of treatment is that you should instruct the patient to return the intestine by his own hand into the interior of his pelvis, if it is willing to return. ‌ ‌ Then he should be made to lie on his back between your hands: and lift his legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut through the entire length of the scrotal skin. Then insert hooks into the two lips of the incision according to your need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be such that it is possible for an egg to emerge from it.
Then scrape away the peritoneum and what is beneath the skin of the testicles until you uncover the white, hard album on all sides. Then insert your index finger between the testicle and that white album which lies beneath the skin, and separate it from the membrane at the back of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles towards the inside with your right hand, and at the same time stretch the white album upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with its membrane towards the incision; and instruct your assistant to lift the egg upwards; and you separate the adhesion behind after the separation is completed.
And search with your fingers to see if there is anything of the intestine twisted within the hard white membrane. If, however, you find anything, then push it down towards the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread made from ten threads of linen; and insert it at the bottom of the membrane, that is, the tunica, which lies beneath the skin following the incision; then cut the ends of the thread that protrude until four threads remain. Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross; and tie with them that membrane which we have spoken of, since it is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature, so that none of the vessels which nourish them may send anything to them; lest there occur from this a hot abscess. And place another ligature following the first ligature, more distant from it by two fingers. And after these two ligatures leave out from the scrotal sac, which is under the skin of the testicles, an amount equal to the size of a finger: and cut off the rest entirely following its roundness, and remove the testicle from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles with a section from which blood and pus flow, as we have described in what precedes.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound, and apply the ligature that we have described. And sometimes the white scrotal sac which we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing a flow of blood. For often it happens. And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be soaked in warm water; and place on it that which we have mentioned until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
¶ Concerning the Swollen Anus.
In this case of swollen anus I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.  /> But if he wants to use iron, let him cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and let him cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let him introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum.
And indeed the first [authorities] said that it is done just as we have described in the case of piles with a fleshy base. That is to say, after the incision sew up the skin beneath it with ease; then cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> But there are those who want to cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And there are some who say that if they are not able to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And if it is not possible to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And there are those who say that if they are not able to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And if it is not possible to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And there are those who say that if they are not able to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.  /> And if it is not possible to introduce a probe into the anus because of its narrowness, then let them cauterize around the anus at the place where the inflammation is more intense; and then let them cut through the skin with a lancet above the anus as much as the width of two fingers.  /> And then let them introduce a probe into the anus, and let it be long enough to reach from the upper part of the buttocks to the lower part of the scrotum; and let them sew up the skin beneath it with ease; and cut in the middle [of the inflammation], and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the skin falls off: and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.
Chapter LXVII
"On ruptures that occur in the groin.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area swells and nothing from the intestines descends: if it does descend, it is little and returns in all hours; but if this condition is prolonged, a tear forms in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
This occurs due to the stretching of the scrotum in the groin, as we have said. Which is because the scrotum is stretched; then it softens and becomes swollen, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with cautery, as was told in its preceding account.
Sometimes it is treated with a knife in this manner: the patient should lie on his back between your hands. Then cut the area of the ruptured and swollen protrusion with a longitudinal incision, to a width of three fingers. ‌
Then tie the scrotum and its contents under the skin until the white scrotum that follows it is exposed.
Then take a bandage and place it over the protruding area of the scrotum, and press it deeply into the abdomen. ‌
Then if there are two protruding areas at the end of the bandage from the scrotum, and join one with the other using a stitch; then remove the end of the bandage.
And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor pull on the testicle or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernias.
Then treat it with wound care. When you cut the threads, clean it and close the wound until it heals. ‌ ‌
For the scrotum contracts and no swelling of the rupture occurs. ‌
And cautery is better in this place because it is closer to health.
Chapter 68
On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
The skin of the testicles is often softened in certain men, causing the flesh between them to become soft and their appearance to be disfigured.
Therefore it is necessary for the person who is asked to treat this condition to make the patient lie on his back and cut away all the softened skin down to the natural skin.
Then bring together the two lips with stitches; and if you wish, first remove any excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches, and make the stitching firm.
Then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69
§ On castration.
Know that castration is forbidden by our law and therefore it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine. And mentioning it is not necessary except for two reasons.
The first reason is so that a doctor may know about it when asked about it, and be able to treat someone who has undergone it.
The second reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our own benefit, such as rams, donkeys, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore that castration can be done in two ways.  Either by rubbing. Or by cutting and slicing.
In the method of rubbing, the way to do it is this: make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be felt.   
"However, in castration by tearing and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and press its testicular skin with your left hand.
"Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with one cut until two testicles come out. After skinning both, incise them after you have removed from the scrotum everything except the fine skin that is over the vessels.
"And this method of castration is better than that which is done by friction, because friction perhaps leaves something of the testicles, so that the animal desires copulation.
"Then care for the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70
"§ On caring for a hermaphrodite of two kinds.
"A hermaphrodite is made from men in two ways. "One way is that it appears in him following the space, or on the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, in the form of a woman's vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from what is on the skin of the testicles.
"In women, however, there is only one form, and it is like a woman's vulva on the pubis, just as if small male testicles were very prominent towards the outside: of which one is like the male penis, and two like two testicles.
"And the treatment for these three kinds—the two from men and the one from women—is that you should cut away the attached flesh until its impression is removed. "Then treat them with the care of other wounds.
"In the second type of men, from which urine exits and is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation or care at all.
Chapter 71.
"§ On the cutting of excrescences and prominent flesh in women's vulvas.
Possibly the disease is added to a natural part, until it becomes ugly and unsightly: And sometimes it is greatly magnified in certain women, so much so that it expands as in men, and reaches the point of coition.
Therefore, you should hold the excess of the disease with your hand or with a hook, and cut it off: And do not proceed too far with the cutting, especially at the root of the deep part: So that there is no flow of blood.
Then care for it as you would a wound, until it heals.
But the flesh that is born is the flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it: And perhaps it goes out to the outside like a tail: And because of this some call it a 'tailed disease'. Therefore, you should cut it off as you would the wart, and care for it until it heals.
¶ About treating ulceration, which is an unperforated woman's genital sore.
Chapter 72.
An ulceration is when a woman has a sore that is not perforated, or has only a small hole. And it is either natural or accidental. ️
An accidental one is due to a previous disease: And this itself occurs either from added flesh that was born, or from sifach (a type of skin lesion), whether thin or thick. And it forms either in the depths of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or its lower part: And it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps even menstruation.
And recognition of it is done by the midwife's inspection, if there is an apparent swelling nearby.
If it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers or with a stick.
But if the swelling is from thin sifach and is near the two lips, then hasten and tear it off. ️ ️ ️
And it is like this: place small pills on the two lips.
Then place your fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread apart. Then stretch both lips with strength until the fine sifak is torn open and the clitoris is exposed.
Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman come every day, so that the place does not heal in another way.
But if the sifak is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
But if the clitoris is fleshy: then suspend it with hooks and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without cauterization, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and egg white mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a large lead pipe so that the wound does not heal quickly, let her keep it for some days: and administer dry flax thread, then continue with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And sometimes a birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: it is therefore necessary to cut them like this: as long as there is no cancerous tumor in the womb, for with a cancerous tumor that is in the womb, do not use iron at all.
Chapter LXXIII.
¶ On the care of hemorrhoids, and red bothers in women's wounds.
Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood runs from them constantly. xspace
Therefore, when hemorrhoids are aggravated, they become tender; and I have already spoken of their division into species and signs in the section on them: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are at the entrance of the womb and do not protrude: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Those which are at the entrance of the womb and upon which one feels something are those that can be treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house. Then, extend the perineum with scissors or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle on them a powder that stops bleeding from one of the wound-healing powders without cauterization: such as acacia, dragon's blood, sumac, and similar ones.
Then have her press her feet against the wall for an hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the bleeding persists: then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds, oak galls, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on her back.
If the blood clots with it, that is good; if not, apply a cupping glass to her back and breasts without scarification.
Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tamarisk or the juice of sea lavender or the juice of oleander branches, that is, aglander, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When the abscess has quieted down, then treat the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth, however, is reddish and resembles the heads of alfalfa, and has a rough appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut away what appears from it, as I said about hemorrhoids equally: and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LXXIIII.
Perforation of the vagina that occurs in the womb.
There are many kinds of tumors that occur in the womb, such as cancer, stone tumors, ulcers, abscesses, carbuncles (i.e., herpes), abscesses with pustules, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, and warm tumors.
And indeed, I have already mentioned all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the division. It is necessary for me to speak about warm tumors that occur in the womb, when it is among the tumors that collect pus, and I want to know how its opening with iron is done.
Therefore, you should consider. If the pain of the tumor is sharp at its onset with swelling, heat, and fever, and you see it become red; if sensation is lost over it, then do not hurry to open it; and treat it with what helps until the tumor matures, until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat that has two holes, and let her lean forward, or have her lie on her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of the belly; and let her hips be spread apart, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with an appropriate ligament.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is opened.
And when you want to administer this instrument, it is necessary that you pierce the deep part of the woman's womb with a rod; so that what enters from the instrument is no more than the depth of the womb, and does not harm the sick one.
If the instrument is deeper than necessary, then you should place cotton over the opening of the deep womb to prevent the entire instrument from entering into the deep womb; and it is necessary that a screw be placed on the side of the instrument, which runs along the instrument, so that it can hold the instrument and so that an assistant turns the screw until the deep womb opens.
When it appears at the orifice, and can be touched with the hand, and is soft and gentle, then you should cut it at its head with a broad knife.
When the wound is cleaned of pus, then you should place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent properties over the wound, and apply pressure, and extract the incision from the deep womb.
And place externally over the womb and over the pubic bone a clean linen cloth soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Then it should be cleaned after two days with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to using an ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then you should avoid treating it with iron; rather, treat it with what we have mentioned in the section on division.
Chapter 70.
¶ The Art of Midwifery: How to Treat Live Embryos that Exit in an Abnormal Form.
The midwife must first know the natural form of childbirth.
From its signs, you will know that when a woman begins to feel pressure in her lower abdomen and desires fresh air, and what is above her womb is relieved, and the exit of the embryo hastens; then you should know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it exits with its head first, and the amnion either hangs from or follows the umbilical cord. ➤
When you see these signs, then it is necessary that his abdomen be pressed so that the child may quickly descend.
For when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth also descends with it and is purified from those excesses by a good cleansing.
But he who is born other than this way is unnatural and inauspicious.
For sometimes the fetus emerges feet first, and its body comes out before its head, or one of its feet or both of its hands, or only one foot; or it may come out head first with one hand; or perhaps the abdomen protrudes, and possibly turns over onto its neck, and other similar inauspicious positions. 》
Therefore it is necessary that the midwife be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and guard herself from error and deception. And I will show every figure of them, and what is its nature, and what it signifies, and how to handle it.
When the fetus emerges head first in its natural way of birth, and it becomes violent towards the woman, and her labor is difficult, and you see that her strength has already been weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or have women hold her; and fumigate her vulva with fenugreek boiled in water and with moist oils.
Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers, and she should probe with it to find the afterbirth, and she should cut it with her nail until the moisture flows from it; and she should press on the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
After the enema, instruct her to press on herself; and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. The fetus will immediately emerge.
If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to gently bring them back little by little. If it does not comply at the entrance, then place the woman on a stool and lift her feet upwards; then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them off and extract the rest of the fetus; and bind the hand with cloth, and extract it equally, for he will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is over his feet. When the fetus emerges over his feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards, even it out.
Then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
When they emerge up to the hips, then tell her to push and make her sneeze with vinegar; for he will come out if God wishes it.
And if it does not emerge with that which I have narrated, then gradually bring the fetus back until you place him according to his natural shape. For he will come out then with an easy exit.
But if he is hindered with all that I have narrated, then take from mucilage of flaxseed, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum; and pound it all well in a mortar; then bind her vulva and the lower part of her womb with it. Then make her sit in warm water until she reaches the stage of labor pains.
When you see that his lower parts are already warm, then make her a fumigant of myrrh; and apply it to him. Then when he has taken the fumigation for one hour, make her sit on a stool. › Then make her sneeze: and bind her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle compression. For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is between the knees and hands. When it comes out in this manner, then she should insert her hands gradually. ︎ Then the woman should be laid back on her neck, and her feet should hang down; and she should lie on the bed, and she should wrap her hands. Then press gently above her belly. Then pull out what is under her feet from the cushions, until it is prepared at the lower part. But if the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them strongly. Then press gently above the hypochondrium until the fetus rises upwards. Then she should insert her hands and straighten the fetus gradually; and command the woman to push until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands. She should insert her hand for its delivery. But if she cannot deliver it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
However, if she cannot walk, then lay her on the bed; and shake her legs vigorously. ︎ ︎
Then apply the poultice that you have prepared from the mucilages.
But if she is about to give birth, then make her sit on a stool. Then strive to deliver it by hand, and straighten the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to push until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus on its neck, with hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of its mother. The midwife should hold the fetus's hand, then slowly turn it and adjust it with ease.
When it has been adjusted, place on its lips what we have spoken of from oil and mucilages.
Then order her to move slowly. When you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and order her to lean to the right side. Then tell her to press down and make her sneeze with your help.
The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side. When it has descended to the opening of the womb along with the afterbirth in this manner, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is expelled from the moisture.  />
If it hangs over the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and causes death.
Then push the fetus inside until you place it as necessary, and tell the woman to press herself several times, for it will come out easily.
The exit of twins or many fetuses.  />  />  />  /> Know that twins often are born and sometimes three, and four are born. However, this is unusual and rarely happens.
Five is against nature and they do not live at all. Even if they multiply, one afterbirth contains them all, and they are separated by a membrane distinguishing between the ligament of each one's navel.
And sometimes they come out as one fetus comes out naturally and easily through the birth canal, and they come out in an admirable way, as we have said.  />  />  />  />  />
But if some of them are difficult during birth and reach the condition we have mentioned from unnatural shapes, then treat them as we have said: and let the midwife be skillful and do what she does with ease and delay, and she should adapt to every shape along with what is prepared for her by her guiding wisdom towards health.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
Recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos and then miscarried.
Sometimes one is formed in the womb, or two, three, four, five, six, seven, and sometimes more than ten: and indeed I have seen with my own eyes a woman miscarry seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
This was accomplished by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, all this should be within the knowledge of the obstetrician. For perhaps something similar to that will happen to her: therefore she should oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76
¶ On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you are treating a dead fetus with the division I mentioned in the treatment, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use manual intervention, then you should consider this.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution and not suffering from any of the conditions that might cause her to be lost, then it is necessary for the woman to be placed on her back on a bed, with her head tilted downwards and her legs raised; and let a midwife hold her by both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils and linseed, and fenugreek seed mucilage.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should introduce it into the womb with ease. Then let her seek with it the place where she can grab the hooks from the fetus and the places suitable for this.
Therefore consider then, if the fetus is ready to descend head first: then insert the hooks into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or in its shoulder blades, or in places near the ribs and under the hypochondria. ︎
If however the descent is upon his feet, then in the comb and middle ribs of him.
And he should hold the hook with his right hand and place its curvature between the fingers of his left hand. He should then easily insert it with his hand and fix the hook in one of those places that we have mentioned until it reaches the empty space.
Then he should insert another hook or a third one, if necessary, on the opposite side so that there is an equal contraction and it does not deviate to one side.
Then it should be stretched equally and not only straight but moved in every direction to facilitate its exit, just as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.
And between that, there should be something to soften the stretching. If a part is retained from it, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them to roll out whatever is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then they should change the hooks to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand emerges before the other and it is not possible to return it due to its constriction, then they should wrap a cloth around it. Then draw it out until when the whole emerges; cut it either at the junction of the sole or at the elbow: and thus you should do with the other hand and both feet.
If however the fetal head is large or it encounters constriction during birth or there is water collected on its head, then they should insert a thorny spatula between the fingers and shred the head with it to extract the water or break it with an instrument called Almisdac: the shape of which comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similarly, do this if the fetus has a large head by nature: then it is necessary to cut away the alkengematu; or extract it with misdach, as we have said. Then draw out the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out but is constricted at the shoulders, then it should be cut until the fluid from the chest is released.
If however it does not become entangled nor yield to delivery, then cut off the head in pieces, as much as you are able.
If there is a tumor or swelling below the navel, or if it is caused by dropsy, then you should pierce it until the fluid runs out of it.
However, if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is straightforward.
If however it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, then you should extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut open the abdomen or chest until the fluid runs out of them.
If however the other members are extracted and only the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb and seek out the head with it, and draw it towards the mouth of the womb with her fingers; then she should insert a hook or two hooks into it, and draw it out with them.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted due to a hot tumor that has occurred there, then it should not be labored upon, but rather warm and oily substances should be administered; and apply poultices; and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is lying on its side, then it may turn; then administer what we have said for a living fetus.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut piece by piece and extracted.
And you must not leave anything from the placenta inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said for hot swellings that occur in the womb.
If a flow of blood occurs, let it descend into stiptic waters, and administer the remaining cure.
And indeed I have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was; then she became pregnant with another in its place, after which another fetus also died. Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.
I was therefore called for her cure, and I treated her over a long time: but the wound did not heal.
I therefore placed upon it some strong drawing plasters: and a mouth came out from that place. Then some days passed for her, and another mouth came out. I was therefore amazed by this, since there is no mouth in the womb.
I therefore thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
I therefore searched the wound and extracted many bones, while the woman was in a better condition; and she has now lived thus for a long time, and sends forth from that place only a little pus.  />
And I would not have introduced this foreign matter here, except that it contains knowledge and assistance for what the medical artist administers with his hand in a cure.
Chapter 77.
§ On the forms of the necessary instruments for fetal extraction.
The shape of the vertigo which opens the womb.
Here below is the form of the straps with which books are bound, having two windings at the ends of two pieces of wood, each being equal to the other. Verily, this vertigo should be made of more delicate silk, and to make it, either from ebony or boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is as if two fingers, and the edge of each is as one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions of the same type of wood, which are already fixed on both sides, whose length is more or less half a palm, and the width of each is as if two fingers, or more or less.
And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you roll up the two vertigines.
Another shape, similar to it, more delicate and lighter.
It should be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see here above; and the length of each addition is as if a palm, and the width of each is as two fingers.
Therefore, when you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed with her feet hanging down, and that which is between her legs being open.  \\ Then insert these two joined additions into the womb; and you are holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish for the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
The shape of another vertigo which the ancients called the form of the expeller by which the fetus is expelled.
The shape of the Almisdal, by which a large head is crushed; and it resembles a forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is made like a pair of tongs, as you see here in this shape, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is cut and crushed.
The shape of a vice with one spike.
The shape of a vice having two spikes.
The shape of scissors having two ends for cutting off the head.
The shape of two wide scissors as well.
All these instruments are used, and the more their forms are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the faster he is at his work and the higher he is esteemed among men for their number.
Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments, so that it may be prepared by you. For their necessity is inexcusable.
Chapter LXXVIII.
¶ On the Extraction of a Second Twin. xspace 🚫
When a second twin is retained at birth, then you should advise the woman to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze with you: and place your hand over her mouth and nose.  /> If it then emerges by this method, that is good.
If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid. Place in it the following opening-the-womb herbs: calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, anise, cassia bark, and centaury. Take all these herbs or some of them, submerge them in water, and place them over a fire.
Then place a reed in the hole of the pot's lid, with the other end in the mouth of the womb, and let her hold it until the steam reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said. For the afterbirth will come out easily.
But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or thickened mallow juice. Then she should insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it. When she has found it, then she should take hold of it and gently pull it out.
But if it is attached deep within the womb, then she should insert her hand as we have described until she finds the afterbirth and draws it out little by little straight forward so that the womb does not suddenly contract; rather it should gently shift from side to side. Then increase the pulling force gradually. In this way she will comply and be saved and escape from being stuck.
But if the mouth of the womb is narrowed as we have already described, care for her with sneezing and potions made from herbs.
But if it does not come out despite all these efforts, be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction.
Instead, whatever comes out towards the mouth of the womb should be tied to the woman's thigh.  Then give her an enema with four-ingredient ointment.  For it will decay after a few days and be expelled.
However, when it begins to decay, the smell will rise to her head and stomach and harm her. Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered for that purpose.
Some of the ancients have already found that a fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs is effective for this. 
The design of the device used to fumigate a woman who has retained her afterbirth or menses.  
Make something similar to alcama or from mustard seed: and place the broad end over the fire: and the smoke should be placed above the embers: hold it until that smoke is consumed: and repeat with another.
Chapter 79.
Of the treatment of unperforated anus.
Many infants are born whose anus is not perforated, which a soft syringe has already probed. Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that with her finger; and if not, let her pierce it with a sharp probe, and be careful that her arm does not touch him.
Then place a wool cloth soaked in wine and oil upon him. Then care for him with salves until he is cured.
However, if you fear that it will become blocked again, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate. ️
And now, obstruction of the anus also occurs due to the healing of a wound or an abscess. Therefore, it is necessary that that healing be cut out; then treat it as we have said with the treatment and lead.
Chapter 80.
¶ Of the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
The fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodules and swellings that occur near the anus externally; or within the space of one part; and there is one fistula, or many. ️ ️
Therefore, when that nodule becomes chronic, it opens, and from it flows an aqueous white fluid, or thin pus. ️ ️ ️
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore, penetrating ones are known by what comes out from defecation and flatulence when the patient uses defecation; and perhaps a worm comes out of them. ️
And among them are fistulas when they penetrate into the space of the bladder and to the urethral orifice. And among them are those that penetrate to the hip joint and to the tailbone.
The way to distinguish whether a fistula penetrates to the anus, even if it does not penetrate, is this: insert your index finger into the anus and insert a fine probe made of iron or brass into the fistula when there is no curvature.
But if there is curvature, then insert into it a fine probe made of lead or a horsehair until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
If you do not feel it at all, and nothing comes out of the opening upon emptying, nor is there any gas or worm as I have said, then know that it is not penetrating; hasten to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urethral opening, then its indication is the passage of urine from it; and its cure is to close off this passage so that the area may be healed with medicine.
But if it penetrates to the hip joint or the mouth of the hip, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no curvature up to the mouth; and finding pain around the part, and that pus always comes out from it; and that medication does not help it, nor does it heal with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is labor and vanity for the foolish doctor who attempts it.
But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, healing with a saw is hoped for; as I have told you, and I have already proved it: and the procedure is this, that the patient lies on his back between your hands; and raise his legs up to above his hips, and let his hips be bent toward his abdomen. Then he should insert a probe of lead or iron into the fistula, if there is tortuosity, until he knows where the probe has arrived.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Therefore, if you feel the probe has already penetrated through the body and beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula or skin, then know for certain that it is a penetrating fistula; do not labor on it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
However, it is said that in some people the flesh heals and from the medication by which it is hoped for help, let a fine cautery be ignited according to the width of the fistula as previously mentioned, and insert the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches the anus. Then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those added fleshy parts, which are like a bird's feather quill, have been burned away.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter until the burned flesh comes out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and strengthen it.
If it heals, that is good.
And if not, then it will never be cured by any other treatment.
And if the probe comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or skin between it and the probe, and you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula and proceed cutting along with the probe that is in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the tip of the probe was, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then clean those fleshy parts that are like a bird's feather quill, so that nothing remains of them.
If blood overcomes you and loosens between you and your surgery so that it separates those flesh pieces, then it is better for a quicker healing to cauterize them with fire or with sharp medicine.
Because a cautery with fire brings together good conditions: the burning of those flesh pieces, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying out of moisture.
Then care for it with bandages wrapped in butter or crushed cabbage leaves until the place releases pus, and those burnt flesh pieces come out in the pus.
Then care for the wound with healing ointments that produce hard flesh; and there are medicines which contain astringents and drying agents.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you should not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula has already reached as far as the deep part of the anus and is lengthened by the body's excess, then insert your finger into the anus and search with it.  />
Therefore if you feel a swelling and there is a membrane of silk or flesh between you and it, which is close to penetrating, then the operation on that [fistula] is not possible except by way of hope and expectation.
That is, because in it [the fistula] one of three methods is applied: either to cauterize it as we said, or to cut it away until you reach its concavity so that it is possible for you to insert bandages and immediate care. And do not proceed much with the cutting so that you do not cut into the band that contains the anus and cause an unfortunate exit of excrement without will. Then care for it with what we said.  />  />
Perhaps it will heal; or else you lengthen the membrane itself and cleanse it after you have cut it almost to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with some other sharp instrument.  />  />  />  />  />  /> Then cleanse those filtered meats that are in the incision as far as you can with probing.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening where it heals; and there will remain an open fistula in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes the fistula occurs in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the edge of the anus; then take a perforated probe at the tip, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, prepared from rawhide, in this manner. And insert into it a thread wound with five threads, and about such. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its hollow part.
If therefore it penetrates near the inner edge of the anus, then draw out the thread from that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus and extract the end of the thread, and bring together both ends at once; and tie each one, and leave it for one day or two days; and however more the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well until those flesh parts between the two ends of the thread are cut off and fall away; then care for the wound until it heals.
If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then cause it to penetrate by whatever manner you prepare for yourself, except if it is very deep. For indeed it is not for you to do that because of the arm [strength], so that you do not cut it.
Then deal with it as we said until it heals.
The form of a sharp spatule that is used to divide the fistula, whose curve is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter 81.
On the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood flows due to their incision: and the care of fissures.
There are two types of hemorrhoids. For they are either within the anus, similar to small blisters or plums, or as if they were grains of grapes themselves. And from them are small and large ones: and blood always flows from them, whether there is one or many. And they are outside the anus, and at its edges.
However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part moist and of little water, from which flows yellowish water or a small amount of blood with constant discharge: and they are the color of the body.
And its treatment, when it is within the anus, is that you order the patient to sit down: and let it be squeezed out until the anus protrudes and appears to you like a hemorrhoid. Therefore, hang them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail.  Then cut them at their roots.
If hooks do not hold them because of their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or a piece of woolen material and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and after the cutting, sprinkle some hot powders on them so that they act as a caustic. Or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization.   Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not protrude, then give the patient an enema containing a mild purgative, so that it washes with what is in the anus and quickly obeys the expulsion when the patient presses.
If the worms are outside from the anus, then their nature is light and easy. And it is as if you take them with your fingernail or take them with a hook, and cut them off. Then care for them with what we have said until they heal.
And if someone is repelled by the incision with iron, then it is necessary for you to apply their stitches in this manner. Take a thread wound around itself and insert it into a needle. Then draw out the worm upwards and make it penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle in a broad manner, and tighten the worm with a strong constriction. Then tie the thread and withdraw the needle.
Do this with all the worms, and leave one out of them; do not remove it so that the blood can flow out from there.
Then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cedar oil and put it on the anus; and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave him until it falls off.
So when the worms fall out, care for them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
¶ On the Care of Fissures For it often happens from the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
Therefore, when they become chronic and medicine is ineffective on them, then it is necessary that you shave them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they become moist, and remove from them the upper skin which prevents them from healing. Then care for them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal, then shave them with a more severe scraping than the first until they bleed profusely; and then care for them until they heal.
"About treating inverted and uninverted almirma, as well as athelil scars and formicae.
"Chapter Eighty-Two.
"Know that almirmar is nothing but a round knot of the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and from this comes pain during walking.
"Therefore, it should be cut around like the head of a nail and held with tweezers or a hook, and removed from its root.
"Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as explained in its chapter.
"Athelil, however, is one small rough and pitted roundness above the surface of the body. "And they often occur on children's hands.
"Its treatment is that you stretch the athelil and cut it, or bind it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. "And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine, as mentioned before, and now inverted and uninverted athelil will be removed with the instrument that I will describe.
"Formica, however, is also a small rough and pitted raised area on the surface of the body, going very deep; and when cold touches it, it feels like an ant bite, and this occurs throughout the body, but most often on the hands.
"Its treatment is to take a small tube made from a goose feather or a strong vulture feather; and place this tube over the formica until the circumference of the tube contains its edges. "Then roll your hand with the tube until it cuts through the edges of the formica; and place it deeply into the flesh, removing the formica from its root.
And if you wish, make that with an air tube or iron tube, according to this shape.
Let the upper part of the tube be at the height, pulling the swab wrapped around it so that its grasp and rolling off are lessened.
And if you wish, burn the formica as mentioned in the section on burning athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
Chapter 83.
About the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus and for relieving flatulence and colic.
Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or copper, or cast bronze, or hammered iron.  /> ¶ Et si uis, fac eum ex quercu, secundum hanc formam:
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, both small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, what is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and whatever their anus is weak or painful, thus also should be the enema.  /> ¶ Illud autem quod administratur in curatione adultorum sit magnum.
Large enema.
The tube of it, that is the upper end where the bladder is tied, should be wide like this: and there should be a distinct part so that the bladder can be tied as you see, and its lower end which enters the anus should be blunt, that is not open, very smooth, pulling to subtlety; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and slightly thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be from a pig's bladder or from sheepskin that is according to the shape of a small asparagus leaf, whose stem is one palm long.  /> ¶ Et sit canna eius uel argentea, uel ex aere fuso.
And let it be pierced with many holes as if rolled out, and let there be a space between each hole the thickness of a finger. Then put into those holes a thread of raw silk, which should be made up of ten threads or about that number, and attach to it a bag like an esophagus. When the bag is put into it, let the enema be tied at the head between two restricting ligatures with a strong constriction. Then give an enema with it.
And this is the shape of the bag here depicted, and of the holes.
The quality of giving an enema with it is this: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine that has been heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie on their back and lift up their legs; and place under them an intahaan, that is, a hide on which people lie, or a cloth.
Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with the white of an egg, or with a thickening made from fenugreek, or similar substances. Then introduce it into the anus gently. Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands at once and squeeze it forcefully until all the contents of the enema have been expelled into the intestine.  ?>
Then remove the enema, and let the patient raise their legs against the wall.
If the medicine causes him to move his bowels, then he should hold it as long as possible. And if he sleeps with it the whole night through, it is more beneficial.
But if you give him an enema during an attack of diarrhea and his discharge is rapid; then repeat the enema until he is well.
But if there are hemorrhoids or painful boils in the anus, then let the enema be very fine and gentle, like those used to give enemas to children.
And let this be the form of a fine enema on which the skin is tight.
Chapter 84
I have already spoken in the division on the treatment of wounds what was fitting for a book, and here I will speak about their treatment both with hands and with medicines according to their due course.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes the wound, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are made are often like the throwing of a stone: or the cut of a sword, or a knife: or striking with a spear, or a stick, or an arrow: and similar things from many objects.
But the wounds that are made according to places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver: and similar from those members.
And I am relating the treatment of some wounds so that I may put forth that reasoning and rule upon other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the reminder of compounded (wounds) will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Therefore, I say: If a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no broken bone, then consider whether it is from the throwing of a stone or similar objects and has already torn only the skin: and it is a large wound and you fear an unfavorable outcome from hot inflammation: then hasten and perform a phlebotomy immediately, do not delay it; and draw out some blood according to its strength, if there is nothing preventing the phlebotomy, especially if the amount of blood coming out of the wound is small. And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the patient beware of overeating, wine, and heavy foods.
But if anything prevents him from eating in moderation, then let him be fed less, and let him not approach meats or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess forms, only boiled linseed oil, or with wine that has been boiled down to a thick syrup.
But if you are confident that a hot abscess will not form, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and has not been exposed to the air, the powder that I will describe shortly: and if the wound has already been exposed to the air, then apply certain ointments until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or is from a sword cut and similar things, and its lips do not come together by themselves, then bring them together with stitching, as I will describe in the chapter on wounds of the abdomen regarding their stitching.
But if the wound has already been laid open to the bone and hangs loose, and there is no obstacle to its healing except for a small flap of skin, then cut away that flap. Then treat the wound with medicines and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin. And instruct the patient to be fed foods that are thick, such as grain porridge, until it becomes like a porridge, and similar foods.
But if you find rotting flesh that does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all of the rotten flesh and cast it aside; then treat the wound.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it does not close by itself with medicines, then search for the artery. Therefore, if you find that it is not cut through, then cut it with a sharp instrument or tie it off. If necessity requires it when that which I have said is of no use, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then their condition is easy and light: so that you should sprinkle this powder over them, for it consolidates them before the air changes them.
The Method of the Flesh-making Powder. Take one part frankincense, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime. Grind all together thoroughly, and sift it. Fill the wound with this powder, and bind it well until it adheres firmly to it and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it above with fine cloths, and leave it untouched, not unbinding it until it is well healed so that it does not open again. For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense at hand; and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many of the great wounds, when it is placed upon them and bound, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially when it is summertime, then this powder is not intended for such a position; therefore, care for it with what I have said, placing upon it certain digestive unguents, or place upon it poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until they emit pus. 》 Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
But if a fracture occurs with the wound and it is small, then extract that with forceps; and I will now speak of the treatment of skull fractures in what follows.
About Wounds of the Neck
If however a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and a simple head wound in terms of treatment.
But if a nerve of the neck or an artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy for it except to avoid treating it with anything that causes strong coagulation, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things. Because they harm nerves and contract them.
And do not put anything cold at all on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than other members: and that which is used for treatment should be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water infused many times with oil or rose oil, and tuthia when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then apply a suture: or sew its lips together with silk threads. Then care for it until it heals.
But if the wound is deep or an abscess has formed at its lower part where pus is already accumulating, then pierce it in the deeper place of that part.
And if an artery has been cut in the wound and its blood flow has followed: then separate it or cut it off and tie it: or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
But if the thyroid cartilage has been cut, whether partially or completely and the alhaudegia are saved: then gather the lips of the skin with a suture over the tracheal cartilage, and do not touch the trachea, but rather make it even, and bring it back to its natural shape. ¨ Then tie it with a suitable bandage and leave it for several days. Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties until it heals.
But if the wound has already affected the bone, then explore it. And if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them or as many as you can. And whatever is not prepared, leave it until the wound becomes putrid and its outlet separates and loosens.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder I mentioned. However, if bone is visible in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which is mentioned in its chapter.
¶ About the Wound in the Ribs.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see its depth, then consider [the following]: If air escapes from the wound when the patient exhales, know that the wound is fatal.
But if the wound is not deep and is fresh with its own blood, do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood does not collect in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but put an attractive ointment on it and loosen it twice a day. )))
If you do not have ointment at hand, then place an old cloth on the wound's opening so that it absorbs what comes out of it from moisture. And make sure the patient sleeps on the wound so that what accumulates in it is drained away.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound was inflicted and no spasm occurs to the patient, nor is there a bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see that its other symptoms are good: then know that the wound is safe. Care for it with compresses and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if its healing is delayed and it continually opens, then know that a fistula has already formed. Care for it according to the method described in its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then care for it with that which was previously described under stitching, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if the cut has already affected the bone and pieces have fallen out from it, then explore the wound and hasten to remove those pieces if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound becomes foul, for their extraction will be facilitated.
For the treatment of other wounds occurring on other parts of the body, the judgment is the same as that which we have said.
¶ On Wounds of the Abdomen and Exit of Intestines and Their Treatment.
The disruption that occurs in the abdomen is great, medium, and small.
Therefore, in the case of a great disruption, sometimes an intestine or a number of intestines emerge. ‌
For this reason their insertion and suturing are more vigorous and difficult.
And a small disruption is also made difficult in another way. Therefore, their reduction will be more difficult if you do not hasten to return them immediately to their place; for it becomes distended, opens up, and swells, making its entrance difficult.
Therefore, a medium-sized disruption is better than other disruptions, because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two kinds.
You should know that the suture of a vein is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen and for the suture of other wounds of the body; two other sutures properly belong to other wounds. Nevertheless, they are more proper for the suture of the abdomen; and I will tell you each one with an explanation and demonstration.
I say therefore, that when the wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then this is one of two methods. Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said; or because there is swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Therefore, when this is the case, then you should heat it so that you submerge a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water alone. Or boil it in water with hyssop, pepper, and clove, and press the intestine with it until the swelling is resolved.
Sometimes it [the wound] produces wine that has astringent properties, and this is better than plain water for resolving the swelling.
Therefore, when you see that the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or hollyhock has been boiled. For by this its passage is made easy with a small thing.
If, however, its return is delayed after this treatment, then find the small opening with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and there is no need to cut after necessity and the lack of an instrument. xspace
Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp; and its tip should not be very fine like a Spathamus, but rather somewhat blunt. And this resembles a hook, as you see.
When the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then it must be reduced to its natural shape in its proper place, if possible over it, because it is better.
When the disruption is large in the lower part of the belly, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And likewise if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and consideration always to this: that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
And thus you should do this for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
But in small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then make sure there is a pious assistant present between your hands, who holds the entire disruption with his hand: and join its lips together. Then let him who follows the stitching remove something from it, piece by piece: and this is the manner of a common single stitch. ‍
And it is that you should take one needle or several needles according to the size of the wound. Then leave from the end of the disruption a quantity equal to the ring finger, that is, of the physician; and insert one needle besides what you put into it thread in two ends of the skin, with two ends of the thread that is under the skin from inside until you make it penetrate from the other side, and now you have joined together two ends of the skin, and two ends of the thread: and there are four rows.
Then tighten with double thread around the needle several times from both sides together, until the two lips of the wound are joined in a decent union.
Then let go of the thickness of the finger and also insert another needle into it; afterwards pull it out with thread as you did with the first needle. And therefore do not cease doing this with what you need from needles until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness between coarseness and fineness, because fine needles very quickly penetrate the flesh and thick ones have a difficult entry into the skin; therefore it is necessary that they be of medium fineness and coarseness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted into the two ends of the nearby skin very closely, so that the flesh may not be quickly penetrated and the wound opened before its own healing, and also lengthened with the suture, preventing the wound from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient in his sleep; and place little pads of cloth around all parts of them to hold the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the wound is already healed.
And this particular type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds. Because one needle or two, or about that number, is sufficient for their suture.
However, the second type of suture is common, that you join with the suture the four ends: two ends of skin and two ends of sinew as one, with a needle on which there is an equally fine and coarse thread wound.
Then when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, bring the needle back from the side where you began, so that the pulled thread falls from the upper part of the wound; let the suture be as the seam of a cloth by which clothes are sewn together, and place between every suture a quantity of the thickness of a smaller finger.
This stitching is known to people.
And with this stitching I healed a wound that had happened to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was greater than one palm: and about two palms came out from the middle of the intestines, and there was a tear in the middle of the belly.
Therefore, I returned it after his intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore, the wound healed in the space of about fifteen days; and I treated him, and he was cured; and he lived many years after that, converted to his former habits.
And the doctors had judged that it would not heal.
And from a miracle, it was that I did not treat it with ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor anything from the medicines. Therefore, I placed an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and I continued to wash it with honey water until it was healed.
But there are two kinds of stitching that I will describe according to the narrative of the language.
And it is that you should begin with a sharp stitch; and introduce the needle from the outside part towards the inner part.
Therefore, when the needle penetrates into the skin and into the tendon that goes along the length and width of the entire body; leave the end of the thread on the side where you introduced the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part to the outer part at the other end of the suture. ➤
When you have made it penetrate in this way at that end of the suture from the outer part to the inner part; then make it penetrate likewise at the same end from the outer part to the inner part; and leave the end of the thread, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other end from the inner part to the outer part; and continue to penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate into the end of the suture that is in that part, until it penetrates entirely. ➤
Then begin also from this same side, and either the very thing itself along with its tip, which is from the knife in the other side, and extract the needle from the skin that it penetrated.
Then bring it back into that skin, and either the tip of the needle, which is in the other side, with this tip of thread: and extract it from the skin on its part, and do this once and another; and do this once after the other, until its entirety is brought out externally according to that example.
And the end of this stitch is that just as there are stitches for peeling skins which are on skins, so also needles once from one side of the skin tip: and that you leave them once from another side, until you complete it.
The second kind of stitch which Galen called proper.
This statement has been narrated in such a way that some physicians do this according to the likeness, so that they bring together every part to its suitable companion by nature: and they apply the tip of the needle to its other tip, and the tip of thread to its other tip. And this is done as I tell you.
It is necessary that you drive the needle into the near end of the thread from you on the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner in that only: and leave two tips of needle. Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner in the two tips of needle, that is on both sides.
Then turn both of them and also make both penetrate from the inner to the outer, into the two other ends of thread which are on the opposite side.  \\
And this method of stitching is better than common easy stitching, and it is the stitch whose mention preceded.
"This is therefore also the saying of Galen.
And some said. The stitching of the abdomen should be corrected with two needles. That is, you introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, following the stitching of those who evenly sew hides.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
However, the judgment of treating a wound is the same as for other wounds.
That is, when you obtain a fresh wound with its own blood before the air alters it, and bring out the intestine, and sew it up, and make it firm, then place powdered kermes on it.
But if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it certain ointments which you have at hand, until they cause pus: and the threads fall out, and the silk and myrrh are strengthened. Then care for it as is the care of other wounds, until it heals.
But if the medications are not at hand, then place on it immediately from when it begins to emit pus, old cotton: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
For you do not need another treatment in many cases, when the wounds are simple.  />
But if you fear that the wound may communicate with the main members during injury, then it is necessary to soak a soft wool cloth in warm oil or rose oil, and place it around the areas between the groins and under the armpits.
But if he feels pain or pricking or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then enema him with warm stiptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and caused a piercing exitus up to its concavity.
And know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing, and what is from them is from the small intestine, more difficult to heal.
And the intestine which is called jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is due to its multitude of veins and their size, and due to the fineness of its body, and the proximity of the nature of the nerves themselves.
But if what comes from the wound is a cord and you find it fresh, reintroduce it according to your usual method of reducing intestines equally.
But if a length of time has passed and it has already turned green or black, then you must tie it with thread over the darkened part to prevent bleeding from happening. For in a cord there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its traction upon you is alleviated, and the pulling out of it in the case of a cord, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
§ Remembering the Wound that Occurs in the Intestine.
When an injury occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in some men, because I saw a man who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound healed, and a fistula formed, and from it came discharge and gas. )))
I therefore applied treatment until I did not trust in his healing; nor did I cease to examine it closely, until the place was healed and consolidated.
After I saw that the place had already healed, I feared for the patient that a similar misfortune would occur in his abdomen; and this misfortune did not happen to him from that time onward. And he remained in his better condition, eating and drinking, having intercourse, entering the bath, and exercising according to his diet.
And some of those who perform experiments have said that when there is a wound in the intestine and it is small, then it should be ligated in this manner. And it is necessary to take ants with large heads. Then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants whose mouths are open on the two lips of the wound. Therefore, when it bites onto them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick, and not come loose.
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants, one after the other, according to the entire extent of the wound.
Then return him, and his wound. For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is healed and there is no further harm to the patient at all.
And it is also possible to ligate the intestine even with a fine thread: that which has been taken out of the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into a needle.
And it is necessary to take the end of this thread from the intestine, and scrape off much of its flesh. Then tie a fine linen thread at its end. Then insert that thread into a needle and sew the intestine with it. Then return him to his rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of faith and hope. />
You should know that a large and deep wound, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy except to cauterize, and it will not heal at all.
On the Care of Zukhemen and Fistulas
You should know that any wound or abscess when it becomes old and chronic and turns into an ulcer and does not heal and always discharges pus and does not come to a head: then it is called generally in whatever member it may be a Fistula, and we call this Zuchemen.
And indeed a Fistula is in truth a knotty, hard, white, filtered ulcer, with which there is no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather; and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And at certain times it is moist, discharging pus. And sometimes the moisture may break up at certain hours. And this moisture may be sometimes much and sometimes little; thick sometimes and other times thin.
And I have already mentioned this in the division, when I said "wounds," that any ulcer which does not heal and in which no flesh is generated, it is only for one of nine causes.
One of these causes is either because of the scarcity or poor quality of blood in the body; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the birth of new flesh; or because it contains much filth and impurity; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine used for its treatment is not suitable; or because a falling corruption in the region is pestilential, or because of some property specific to that region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is difficult and the natural healing of abscesses is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, within it. ︎
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and the treatments of them with medicines by division; and here it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Cyst, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Therefore, know that a Fistula can occur in all the members of the body. For of these there are Fistulas which reach the large veins or arteries, or nerves, or spleen; or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs; or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the compound joints by composition; such as the hand and foot. And there are those which go towards the vicinity of the principal member, and similar ones.
Therefore, among these Fistulas, the one of this kind is difficult to cure from illnesses and does not accept treatment, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorance.
But if there is any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its treatment, and you wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or silver, if the Fistula extends straight, and search it with this.
But if there is any crookedness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead. Because lead, on account of its softness, adapts and curves around the crookedness.
If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate upon it with a probe. Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from its openings.
For the moisture by which you irrigate it goes towards other openings and runs out from them.
Then carefully investigate how it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is an orifice or a nerve there, and the cavity of the Fistula is distant or near; or whether it is one Fistula which has many openings, and stand over all of it, with your utmost strength, with your questioning of the sick person, and with the discovery of pain upon pressure with your hand on that place, and similar signs and causes happening to an abscess.  />  />
When you have stood over all those things with true steadiness, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is that at that time you should consider whether there is a visible Fistula nearby or in a safe place far from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you. Then cut the Fistula as described in my account, and remove what is in it from filtration and corrupted flesh, which comes out of its opening from flesh, pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
If the Fistula is deep and straight, then you must cut it as deeply as possible. Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply strips wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the Fistula which you have grasped with the iron; do this several times until the sharp medicine has corroded all that remains in the cavity of the Fistula from corruption.
Then heal it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals.
But if it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have described.
If the cause of the Fistula is a bone, and you have ascertained this, then examine it, and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from the vein, or nerve, or main member, as we said. 
If the bone is exposed and there is some corruption and blackness on it, then scrape it until all its corruption has been removed. Then heal it with what causes it to become fleshy until it heals.
If it does not heal and exudes pus as before, then you should know that you have not completely removed all the corruption.
Therefore, clean it thoroughly a second time, and carefully make an incision into it, and cleanse it with all your strength.
Then restore it. If it heals, that is good; but if not, then know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached. You have no skill in that, unless you leave it to nature.
But if the wound is small and possible for you, attract it with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then carefully attract all of them, and do not leave any out with your strength.
But if anything resists you because of moisture and there is no fear or danger in cutting it, then cut the moistures and flesh if they are there and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place on the wound something that will cause it to putrefy; and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and moistures has putrefied.
And watch the wound so that it does not become healed. And let the incision you have made in your procedure be tightened. Put on it, if you wish, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any of the green ointments.
For when those moistures have putrefied and the bones are separated from them, their removal and attraction is facilitated.
But if the wound is one large wound, such as a thigh or hip wound and the like, and if what has become corrupted from it is a large part, then scrape it with the utmost care until that blackness and corruption are removed. Then heal the wound.
If however the corruption is in it and the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw through the bone and cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption reaches; then heal it until it heals.
And I tell you about a ulcer that happened to a man on his leg; so that you can use it as an example and assistance for your procedure.
There was a young man about thirty years old to whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause that moved within him inside the body, that is, from internal causes, until the material reached the leg and formed a large swelling: and there was no external cause for this.
Therefore, time passed with him in error by the physicians, until the swelling was opened and many materials flowed out with it. And his treatment was neglected until the leg formed a fistula and many openings were made in it; all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one among them skilled in the art of surgery, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the materials that flowed from those openings in large quantities; even the entire body of the man had already become emaciated, and his color was yellow.
I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings of the places, and the probe reached the bone.  (lit.: "and the probe came to the mouth")
Then I examined all the openings and found that they communicated with each other from all parts of the leg.
I hurried therefore and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted, which was already eaten away and blackened, and putrid, and perforated until it reached the marrow.  (lit.: "until it had penetrated up to the marrow")  ()
I have discovered and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I determined that there was nothing in the bone except for that corruption which I cut out and sawed off. And I have already removed it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with medicines that promote healing for a long time. And it has not healed.
Then I tried again and uncovered the bone a second time above the first exposure, and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and I sawed off what appeared to me from that corruption as well.  />
Then I attempted to restore it. And it was not restored.
Therefore I uncovered it again and did not stop cutting the bone into pieces and trying to restore it, and it was not restored, until I had cut off about one hand's breadth of bone with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines and it healed quickly and was cured. And this repetition of the operation and cutting of it would not have been necessary, except for the condition of the patient's weakness and his small capacity to endure, and my fear for him of death, because he fainted from the excess of the evacuation at every hour with great difficulty.
Therefore he was cured with a complete healing: and in the place of the bone, hard flesh grew, and a good constitution developed in his body, and his strength returned: and he returned to his usual habits, and it did not cause him any harm at all in walking.
But if the bone protrudes from a place that was already fractured, then you should saw it off in this manner: and that is, take a bandage and tie it around the end of the protruding bone, and command someone to pull it upwards, and put another bandage of thicker wool underneath the first bandage. Then tie it on the flesh that is above the bone, and extend its end to draw the flesh downwards, so that you expose the flesh over the place you wish to saw, lest the saw injure the flesh.
Place a stick or board under the bone below in an orderly manner, because when you do that, it will not prevent the sawing of the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done on the corrupted place for a short while, so that corruption does not befall the concavity of the bone; and so that it does not become apparent to the senses in its appearance, compelling another part to be sawed instead.
If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, but rather one of its parts is connected to another part, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then expose all the flesh from every part completely. Then place a stick below.
Then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing continues to the other side; and let the sawing be according to the length of the corruption for a short while, as we have said.
But if the corruption is at a joint, cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
But if the corruption is at a continuation of two joints, then there is no skill required except scraping.
But if the corruption is in the comb of the hand or the comb of the foot, then the matter in it is very difficult. Truly, you must examine how the corruption appears to you. And scrape it and clean it in whatever way is possible for you and with whatever skill you can manage, when a vein or nerve does not stand in your way.
And know that there are many instruments and saws for cutting these bones according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness or thinness, their size or smallness, their hardness or softness. 》 Therefore, you should prepare an appropriate tool for each type of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the form of the tool you need when your study is prolonged. And the knowledge of the methods of this art is evidence of the methods of illnesses, for then you will find through yourself that which is suitable for each from the tools for every ailment.
And I confirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of tools, which you will set as examples on which you will operate, and the test by which you will experiment on others. 》
The shape of another saw.
The form of the scissors for joints. Let the head of this scissors be according to the form of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points according to the form of the points of a spindle whorl.
And it is not suitable except for when the heads of joints are rubbed with it, when they become corrupt or when the mouth is wide and large.
The form of the larger scissors. 》
The shape of the broad scissors.
The form of the scissors which has a hollow.
The shape of another fine scissors. 》 》 》 》
The shape of another curved-tipped scissors.
The shape of a small and fine-pointed pair of scissors.
This resembles a rib, and its end is like a saw: it appears in many places due to the reason of bones.
The shape of the scalpel fits the nature of what has been penetrated by the bones.
Its end is triangular and sharp.
It comes from India. And likewise, all that we have said must be made from scalpels, incisors, and saws.
¶ On the incision of limbs and sawing of bones.
Limbs become putrid either due to an external cause or an internal one.
When you have treated that corruption with medical treatment and it does not help, and you see the corruption spreading to the limb without any cause; then you must incise that limb up to where the corruption reaches, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a greater defect of the limb.  />
And the sign of this is that the limb becomes blackened until it stinks; whether fire has burned it or it has become putrid after the blackening. Until that putrefaction reaches what follows the limb and spreads throughout the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the bite of some venomous things, such as a sea-scorpion, viper, asp, or similar.
If the corruption or bite is on the tip of a finger, then cut off the finger and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
And likewise if it occurs on the hand, then cut it off from the root of the wrist, and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the wrist.
And if it invades that part, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
If corruption passes through and you see it about a foot long: then in that is the death of the sick person. And to administer beyond that from treatment is the quantity of strength.
And likewise do for the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot. But if it rises to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
And if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill [to save it], except dismissal and leaving the patient to death.
And the way of cutting off a limb or sawing it is to tie a ligature below where you wish to cut: and tie another ligature above that place. 》 》 》 And let the assistant stretch one ligature downwards; and let the other assistant stretch the upper ligature upwards. And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a wide spatula until all the flesh is laid bare. 》 》 》 》 》 》 Then let it be cut or sawed.
And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth from all sides so that the saw does not touch the healthy place; and a secondary injury may occur to the patient, and a hot abscess [may form].
But if bleeding occurs inside while you work, then quickly cauterize the place; or put on it certain powders that cut off the blood. Then return to your treatment until it is complete. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligature and care for it until it heals.
And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, this same thing that I am telling you about. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
What this means is: "This is because a blackening occurred in his foot due to the burning that resembles fire's burning; and that corruption first affected his toe until it began to affect the entire foot.
Therefore, the man cut himself after he saw that the corruption had fallen on his member with great force, which he felt through pain and burning; and it fell upon him at the joint, and he was cured.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in his index finger of his hand.
So he came to me, and I tried to cure that excess with what I applied on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body; and the excess did not go away, but began to spread into another finger until the corruption affected the whole hand.
He then called for me to cut off his hand; and I refused, hoping that from me the excess would be cured; and I also feared that he might die if his hand were amputated. Because the man's strength was greater than his condition.
After he lost hope in me, he returned to his homeland; and I heard from him that he cut off his hand entirely; and he was cured.
And I have not told this story except to be of help for what falls under this type of illness; and that it may be understood and acted upon accordingly.
§ On the Treatment of Gout and the Preparation of Purgatives with Medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus; then it bursts or is perforated, and what is in it exits with the pus, and there remains a hollow place as if it were a vessel; and the skin above it is like a thin cloth that has been worn away: and the corruption does not reach its end, nor does it press into a bone, nor into a nerve, nor into a ligament; then it deserves to be called Sinus; and it is not called Fistula. However, if its space is prolonged until it presses into one of these members, then it is called Fistula or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut the skin completely as it rolls: and especially when it has been made thin, and turned into cloth: and you can be confident that it will not adhere to the place, due to its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere and that this final corruption does not follow: and if there is thickness in the flesh of the skin, then treat it with an enema: and consider it towards the cavity.
Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and quicklime, the parts being equal, combined in a vessel: and boil them over fire until the medicine turns red: and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take as much of it as you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the cavity with it: and close its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the space of two hours.
Then withdraw it with an expression: do this every day until the cavity is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it should be enemaed with water of ashes, when this medicine is not available to you: and it is that you take ashes from grapevine wood or ashes from holm oak wood: and pour water over them. Then strain it, and enema with it until you are confident that the cavity has been washed out.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then enema it with water and honey, in which some crushed quicklime has already been mixed. Or enema it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey, which cleanses and washes: and wine makes the cavity adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do that several times and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has been removed, then irrigate it with what makes flesh grow therein.
And it is necessary to take some of the plaster called diafinicon; dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine; or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the sinus is narrow and does not accept the cannula for irrigation, then briefly enlarge it with an iron instrument; or place in it a wick wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicum ointment, until it is dilated.
And similarly, if the orifice is also wide, then gather its lips with a stitch; and let out from it the quantity that can enter without increasing the irrigation.
And similarly, if the orifice from which the pus flows is raised higher; then cut it in a lower place within it, so that the pus may flow downward; for when the pus is constricted in the depths of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing therein.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus lower as you wish; then try to prepare the member with a preparation that allows the pus to flow easily, according to what is prepared for you. Try that nothing at all from the pus is retained therein; and take healing ointments which are placed on the sign, suitable for what you wish. And spread them over a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such quantity that it covers the entire sinus. Then cut with scissors a hole directly into the orifice of the sinus, slightly larger than the orifice of the sinus itself.  /> Then spread over another cloth some of the soft ointments according to the size of the hole; and place it on top with a long-lasting position far from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be alleviated; and do not remove the large cloth except after several days, once a day.
But the one that is over the opening of the sinus is the one you remove every hour so that what accumulates in it may exit; and so you may know whether that which runs out of it is much or little: or digested or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of its sinus, whether its master feels pain there or whether there is no pain there and whether it has a swelling there or does not have a swelling there.
Therefore, when your treatment is extended in this manner and you see the matter that comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus is already adhering or approaching adhesion; therefore release it in the morning or on the third day. And when you release the wound, then change another cloth and renew the ointment.
But if after a long time a thin pus comes out of the sinus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching; since among men there are some who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds and there are those who act contrary to that.
But if after many days undigested pus comes out of the sinus, then know that the sinus is not adhering.
If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its process is prolonged; then in drying medicines, let the doctors make them so that they are humid in their substance and dry in their power; such as the ointment dyafinicon, when a superabundance of zegi is added to it.
And from the last chapter to be cured is this: take diaphanic ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, then sprinkle on it ancient wine equal in substance to itself.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And now make something similar to this procedure when you do not have diaphanic ointment: take honey and cook it until it thickens, then use it. Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense: grind all of them together and sprinkle the powder over honey while it is on the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and tie it over the ulcer; and smear it with the honey you cooked until it thickens; and sprinkle powdered spices on it, and place another cloth over it, and tie it on.
And sometimes it is given in that long-stemmed birthwort, and the root of celestial lily, which is lily; and flour of herb, and centaury. Use them either simply or compounded; grind them and sift them; and sprinkle the powder on the honey I mentioned, and use it.
But if the ulcer is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption at its depth; or it has already made an impression on the bones, or other hard parts of the body, or ligaments; then cure it with the treatment for fistulas as was previously mentioned.
§ On the care for whitlow and a crushed nail, and an added finger incision and section.
Whitlow is an abscess that arises under the thumbnail of the hand or foot, and perhaps it may arise in other fingers as well.
So when its condition is prolonged and its care is neglected, it becomes an abscess with hot inflammation; or it becomes corrupt and emits pus until it erodes the root of the nail; and perhaps the corruption affects the whole nail; and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone so that there is a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark. 》
When therefore you cure it with what we have said in division, and your treatment does not help, then you should cut off with a knife all the remaining overgrowth from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For cautery is very healing.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the nail's additions are already pressing into the flesh within, and they begin to sting it and harm it: then you should place a thin wire under the corner of the nail that is stinging the flesh, and push it upward; and cut off that part of the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn and corrode until all of it is removed. Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
But if the corruption has already penetrated into the bone, then you must cut out that bone and remove it; for it will never heal as long as there is a corrupted bone within it.
But if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then cut it off at one of its joints, as was previously mentioned for its remembrance. Then treat it until it heals.
But if there is injury or bruising of the nail and it causes intense pain, then you should bleed the patient first. Then cut the nail with a sharp blade across its width from top to bottom as needed.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for by doing so you will cause intense pain to the patient and it will lead to the addition of new flesh in that place.
Then treat the area with something that eases the pain.
But an additional finger that is born in the hands of some people is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps a nail grows on it; and sometimes its birth occurs at the root of a joint, or it is born in some of the finger's joints. "> That which is born at certain nodes of the finger does not move; and that which is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore, the incision of that which comes from it is easy. Which is, as you cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
However, the treatment of that whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult. Therefore, refrain from incising it.
But in that which is born in the finger at the last of the nodes, then you should cut its flesh with a round incision to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws that fits it. Then care for it until it heals.
However, the stiffening that occurs between fingers often happens either from birth, that is, it is born with it, or from the stiffening of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut away that stiffness until the fingers return to their natural shape. Then place between them bandages or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly stiffen again, and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place consolidates as it should be.
And similarly, if stiffness occurs between some fingers with the palm, then cut away that stiffness according to how it is prepared and appropriate for the shape of the limb.
¶ On the Incision of Birthmarks.
Birthmarks are swollen, thick veins filled with melancholic humors that occur in many parts of the body; and their outcome is most common in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, workers, and those who carry heavy loads.
You should therefore administer purging of the body with black bile frequently and strongly.
Then perform bloodletting on the patient from a basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods. One of them is that they are cut and black blood is drawn out. And the other method is that a vein is elevated and the entire thing is drawn out.
Its cutting is according to this manner. Soak the leg first with very warm water until the thick, muddy blood dissolves. Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of their thigh to the lower part of the knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, with a wide incision.
Then elevate, that is, draw the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and first the phlebotomist should bleed the patient. Then cut the nail along with the lower part until an amount of blood that you see is sufficient and that the strength of the patient can bear comes out.
Afterwards bind it, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile, and repeat evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are filled and it harms the patient.
Its elevation is according to this manner. Shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs on it. Then place the patient in a bath, or soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins become engorged, or have them exercise strongly if there is no available bath, until the limb becomes warm.  />
Then cut the skin along the length of the vein's incision, or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from every part until it becomes perceptible to the senses; and at its appearance you see that it turns red to black. When it comes out of the skin, you see that it is white like a string.
Then introduce under it a rod, until when it is lifted and comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blind hook, gently.
Then cut another incision near that incision by three fingers' breadth. Then strip the skin from above the vein until it appears. Then lift it with rods as you did before, and suspend it with another hook as you did at first.
Then cut another incision, or more incisions, if you need that. Then lift it and cut the last incision at the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision that is above it.
And do this until you pull it out of the higher incision, or all the incisions, until it comes out completely; then cut it off.
But if it does not obey you in being pulled out and lifted; then introduce a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it: and turn your hand to every part until it comes out. And beware that it is not cut.  /> If you can't extract the vein as described above, use a strong needle with double thread and tie it around the vein. Then pull it out gently. Alternatively, insert a rod under the vein and turn your hand in all directions until the vein comes out completely. Be careful not to cut the vein during this process. For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to lift it up, and a great harm will come upon the patient from that.
Therefore, when you have pulled it out completely; then place on the wound site a wool cloth soaked in rose oil or oil; and care for him until he is healed.
If the tendon is contracted and has a twist such that it winds around parts, and is not straight as we said before: then you should cut through it at every point of its twist and places of its winding.
Then suspend it with hooks until you raise the whole thing: and be careful not to cut a vein or cause injury at your cut, for it will be difficult for you to raise or extract it. Therefore, be wise.
The Shape of the Incision by Which a Tendon is Treated.
The Shape of the Blind Stitch.
It does not have a curve like the other stitches, nor does it have an acute tip so as not to injure a vein; and it is of thick, flexible material, gentle: because if it were thin, it would cut through the vein with its thinness; rather, let there be some excess thickness in it, as we said.
On the Extraction of a Vein from the Leg.
This vein is found in the legs in hot countries, such as Alsace and the Arab lands, and in dry, hot countries of little fertility, that is, where neither grass nor trees grow.
And perhaps it occurs in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from the corruption that occurs under the skin, just like the corruption that occurs within the body with snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a severe swelling occurs in the leg.  /> Then the place becomes blistered. Then the vein begins to come out from that place of blistering, like a root of a plant or an animal.  />  />
Therefore, when its end appears, then you should wrap a piece of lead around it, weighing from one and a half drams to two and a quarter drams, and tie it; and let the hanging lead be suspended from the leg.  />
Whenever something comes out from it to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it off. If it is extended greatly, then cut off a part of it, and wrap up the rest. And do not cut it off completely until it has come out entirely. For if you cut it, it contracts and goes into the flesh, causing an abscess and rotting in that place, and a bad sore.
Therefore, it is necessary that it be gently handled and drawn out little by little until it comes out completely from its end, and nothing remains of it in the body; and this vein, in some people, comes out to a length of five palms and ten. And now it has come to me because it came out of a man from twenty palms.  />
But if it is cut during your treatment, then insert a rod through its opening and pierce it with a long hole, along with the body, until everything that is in it from matter is evacuated; and apply rotting of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat him with the care for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself; and many openings occur on it, and a branch comes out from each opening.
Therefore treat it as we said in the division, and with what was stated before.
¶ On the cutting of worms generated under the skin, which is called the disease of cows.
This disease is named in a certain land among us the cow's disease, because it often happens to cows, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.  />  />
And it goes through the whole body, ascending and descending; and it is perceived by sense during its motion from member to member, until it bursts into whatever place it bursts on the skin and comes out.  />  />  />
"And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. "Just as worms and snakes, that is, leeches and roundworms, occur in the stomach.
"And it is feared because of its malice. "Because when it moves through the body and is raised to the head and reaches that place, then perhaps it opens there and exits, destroying the eye; and this often happens.
"Therefore, when you wish to cure it and remove it, this can only be done during its movement and appearance to the senses.
"It is therefore necessary that you tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature. "Then cut above it and extract it.
"But if it has penetrated deeply into the flesh and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire on the spot until it dies.
"And what is more to be feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
"But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then tie a good ligature around the eyebrow below it. "Then cut above it and extract it.
"And the patient should use purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humors.
"And he should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
"Concerning the incision for Nakir's disease.
"This illness is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it changes from one member to another.
"And I myself have already seen it, as I am now telling you. "I was called to a sick woman in certain villages. "And she revealed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the cord of the arm vein." ‌
And after one hour had passed, I saw a swelling advancing with a torch, just like a worm, ascending to his shoulder more quickly than it possibly could be: as if it were living silver, running from place to place.
Therefore the pain retreated from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then I waited one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then he told me that it was revolving throughout his whole body, as I saw.
Therefore I marveled at the speed of its change from member to member. And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way. However, I have seen many who find pain changing from member to member; and I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman. 》
And I do not think that is so unless it is because the woman was one of those who are from dry-bodied people with exposed veins; therefore it appears to the senses that the gaseousness has been changed.
And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
When therefore you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain, then if it is appearing to your eye as we have said, then bind swiftly above it and below it; and cut above it until the gaseousness emerges constricted; and cauterize the place.
If however you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat him with a body purge and with that which expels gaseousness, and mixes them with foul pills and pills of celery seed and the like.
On the Extraction of Arrows
Arrows are distinguished by their various types and the places where they strike the body.
For there is a diversity among them, since some have large tips and others small ones; some are hollow, and others blunt. And among them are those that have three points. And among them are those with tongues (barbs). ))) And among them are those with stars (fletchings).
But those that fall according to the members where they strike are of two kinds. ))) For the members are either from the main hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestines, bladder, and similar ones. ))) )))) ))) When, therefore, it falls into one of these organs and the signs of death, which I will tell you about later, appear to you, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows the person in whom it is found in many cases. But when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden deep within the organ, then extract it and care for the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and pierces through the bone and exits above the brain are: because a severe headache occurs from it, along with blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile. ))) ))) )))))) And perhaps blood may exit from the nostrils or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed. ))) And from the place of the wound a white moisture like boiled starch exits. ))) ))) And it comes out of it resembling wateriness of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple and the person feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not an empty one. And perhaps there is a movement of the arrow similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood runs from the wound. And it is followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting spells. Know therefore that death has certainly come.
And the sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung is the issuing of frothy blood from the wound; and the veins that follow the neck swell up, and the color of the patient changes. And he breathes out a large, deep breath, and seeks cold air to breathe in.
If the arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great panting with intense pain, along with sighing; and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out of the wound with it.
And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed there, then something comes out of the wound - either feces, or a piece of intestine that has already been torn. There is therefore no hope in treating it or in extracting the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out, and something protrudes to the outside, and the pain is stronger upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and arm, and scapula of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are healed in many ways when the arrow does not find an artery or a nerve; and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you that I have seen these arrows, so that you may indicate through it the treatment for yourself.
What happened was that a certain man had an arrow strike his tear duct at the root of his nose. So I removed it from the other side, from under his ear's fat: and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew that had struck him under his lower eyelid in the eye's fat: and the arrow was already hidden, and I only got out of it a small part of its end, to which its wood adhered: and the arrow was large for Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no barbs.
So the Jew was cured, and no misfortune befell his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and that is the kind with barbs. So I cut above it between two guides [muscles]: and it was already sunk into his throat. So I made myself fine with it, until I removed it: and the Christian was cured.
And I removed another arrow from a man that had struck him in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After thirty days had passed and nothing about his condition changed, I cut above the arrow: and I inserted a probe into it, and I removed it: and he was cured, and no misfortune befell him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had struck, and the wound over it had healed. After seven years had passed, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had struck, and the wound over it had healed, and the arrow remained within her: and nothing about her condition changed, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
I saw another man who had an arrow fall into his face; the wound became healed and remained, causing him little pain. And there were many similar cases like these.
I removed an arrow from a man who was one of the King's nobles; it had fallen into his nose and had already deviated slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called for his treatment after the fall of the arrow until three days later. I found that the wound from the arrow was very tight.
I sought to examine it with a fine probe, but did not feel anything; and he himself felt the puncture and pain under his right ear. Therefore I hoped that the puncture was from the tip of the arrow.
I plastered the place with a plaster that had attracting and digestive power, confident in myself that the spot would swell up and give me a sign of the arrow so that I could cut over it; but nothing happened in the place indicating that the arrow had reached there.
Therefore I continued to plaster it with a plaster for many days; and no sign appeared, but the wound became healed in the meantime. And he remained weak from its extraction for some time until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. And he told me this.
And he told me this. I placed a sharp, caustic medicine on that wound for many days until it opened up; and with a fine probe I probed it, and felt the tip of the arrow which was attached to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly; and for me, a period of about four months had passed with him.
After the wound had become enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, but it did not comply with coming out; then I did not stop seeking ways and contrivances over it until one day I began on it with well-made forceps, as will appear in their form at the end of this chapter, until I removed it. "> Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno. Then I restored the wound.
And indeed physicians judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored. Therefore I restored it [the nasal cartilage], and the wound was healed, and the patient was cured with perfect health; nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the method of extracting certain arrowheads, so that you may take this as a rule and interpretation for what I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their divisions are not included with the narration; nor does the book contain them, and a skilled craftsman compares what is present to what is absent, and finds a new operation and a new instrument for unusual occurrences in this art when they happen.
I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the members to which they are fixed except in two ways. Either by pulling from the place through which it entered.  /> Or by cutting through the opposite side of the limb.
And that which comes out from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is pulled out, and comes out.
But if it does not submit to coming out from the hour in which it fell, then you must leave it alone for several days until the flesh surrounding it putrefies; and its removal is relaxed and its exit facilitated.
And similarly, if it is fixed in a bone and does not submit to coming out, then leave it alone also for several days; and continue to pull on it with every movement every day until it comes out.
But if it does not submit to coming out after several days, then you must bore around the arrow in the bone from every side with a fine awl until the arrow is enlarged. Then pull on it and extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden in the body and concealed from sense: then seek it with probes. But if you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in depth, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge the wound over it, until the wound is widened and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
But if there are any barbs with which it is held, then free the attached flesh from all sides by every means you can, and use ingenuity, if it cannot be pulled out because of the tearing of the flesh in the fracture and twisting of the bones, until it comes out.
And you, when you administer the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all parts, until you make it come out: and act subtly at last with great subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and the extraction of itself becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot heal it within one hour, then leave it for a few days until what is around it rots. Then revisit it: for the skin will be relieved. But if you experience a flow of blood, then administer what was said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And administer skill in every way possible for the arrow's escape: and let it be with ease, tranquility, slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, you make it weak according to the shape as it was at the time of the arrow's entry into the body. Because this is more beneficial. But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
If the arrow comes out from the opposite side or if something already protrudes to the outside, or if the tip of the arrow causes a swelling that you can feel through the skin above it and you see it protruding, then cut over it, and let the incision be as wide as forceps can grasp.
Then pull it out, for it becomes easy to exit.
But if it is stuck in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow impresses itself into the bone and enlarges its own passage; then pull it out.
And if not: leave it for a few days; then revisit it until it comes out.
If the arrowhead is wooden, then push it through with it.
But if the wooden part has broken off and you wish to administer a push: then introduce into it a concave instrument so that its concavity fits into the arrow's shaft; then push it out with it.
If however the arrowhead is concave, then push it with an entering tool into itself. The arrow is relieved by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all of the flesh in which there is venom: if you are able to do that. Then treat it with what is appropriate for that.
But if the arrow falls into the chest or belly or bladder or side, and it is close to that which you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then stitch the wound if you see it and treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
The ends should be like the beak of a bird, made of iron, and when they grasp onto the arrowhead, they do not release it.
And from them many forms are made: large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and slenderness of the arrow, and the width and depth of the wound.
The shape of a concave pusher.
And the shape of a deaf pusher.
This is the end like a radius, so that its entrance into the concave arrowhead may be relieved and pushed with it.
¶ On bloodletting of veins.
There are thirty veins that are commonly used for bloodletting in the body.
Of which there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins that are behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear in both temples; and two veins that are in both tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the "watchers"; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the tip of the nose. /> And the two jugular veins that are in the neck. And the two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth. And the two veins that are in the lower lip. And these are the veins which are called Algecherich. And the two veins that are under the tongue.
But the veins which are bled in the arms are five in each arm.
One of them is the cephalic, and it is from the side of the woods; and the common people name it the vein of the head. And the dark one. And it is the median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic; and the common people name it the vein of the body. 》 》 》 》 And the basilic, and it is placed on the domestic side; and it is also named the tickler. And the common people name it the vein of the belly. And the tendon of the arm, and it is placed on top of the faucet; and that is the one which is bled, and it is that which appears above the thumb in a clear manner.
And the little savior; and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the smallest one; and there are two branches to it.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is under the curvature of the thumb on the side of the woods. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 And the second one is the saphenous; and its place is near the heel on the domestic side. And the vein called nessis; and its place is by the heel on the side of the woods.
And in the other part of the leg there are three similar veins. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
¶ On the bleeding of the two veins behind the ears.
Cutting the two veins behind the ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, migraines, scabies, and old sores of the head.
And the manner of bleeding it is as I relate: And it is done by shaving the head of the patient, and rubbing his occiput where the two veins are with a rough cloth until well rubbed. Then let the patient tie their neck with a band, until the two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears, in two depressed areas of the head. Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark there with a cautery.
Then take the phlebotomy knife, which is called an incision knife. Then insert it under the vein into the skin, until the phlebotomist reaches the mouth of the vein. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin using an incising cut.  And let the blood flow from the vein until it flows of its own accord.  Then take a cotton bandage and bind the wound well with it, so that no air may reach the wound. And let the length of the incision be about the size of two joined fingers, or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then bind it with wool bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And now, at the beginning of this chapter, there was described their incision and cauterization.
The bleeding of the two arteries which are in the temples is beneficial for old migraines, crooked squinting, chronic blepharitis, and the flow of sharp excess fluids to the eyes.
And the manner of bleeding them is as I shall tell you. The patient should tighten his neck greatly until two veins become clearly visible to the touch and their pulse is felt under your finger. Then mark those signs with cautery.
Then lift the skin above the vein with your index finger and introduce the lancet underneath it, lifting the vein upwards. Cut it as you did with the two other veins, and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then release the patient's constriction and place your finger over the vein for one hour. Then place a bandage and some wool over it, and tie it firmly with a constriction: leave it until it heals.
And now, the mention of them, their cutting, and their extraction has preceded at the beginning of the book.
The benefit of bleeding the temporal vein is after cephalic bloodletting for old facial diseases, and for migraine and redness, and foul ulcers. ›
And its quality of bloodletting is as I tell you. The patient should constrict his neck with a cord until the vein appears. › › Then take the instrument called a scoop. › ›
Place the pointed tip of the scoop over the vein and strike it with a comb or something similar to it; allow the blood to flow according to your will. Then release the patient's constriction and tie it firmly until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet. However, it should not be a sharp-pointed lancet like the others; rather, it should have a broad point. › › › And with bloodletting she is according to transfusion, because the mouth is nearby; and perhaps the bloodletter will break there when it is delicate.
The treatment of the two veins that are in both lacrimal orifices is for the eye due to scabies and redness, and for inflammation in the eye, and diseases of the face.
And the quality of bloodletting them is that the patient should tie their neck with a bandage. Then bleed them, and you should be standing over their head.
And let the bloodletting be along the length of a little, with a small bloodletter, somewhat wide, for there is no flesh in that place. For if the bloodletter is delicate at the tip, perhaps it will break.
Then let as much blood flow out as you need. And place a poultice over them and bind them for one night, and then remove it.
The bloodletting of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and severe headache, and diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that occurs on the face; especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of this bloodletting is that the patient should tie their neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long bloodletter, and insert it into the middle of the nostril itself, between what divides the nose lengthwise. ¨ Because the vein is not apparent there by touch, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you should remove your hand with the bloodletter a little and let as much blood flow out as you need. ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ Then tie it up for one night. For it is quickly restored.
But Guidi's two venesections are beneficial for treating shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, melancholic illnesses, impetigo and severe ulcers, and gnawing pains, that is, herpes zoster.
And the method of these venesections is that the patient should draw tight under both armpits with a ligature; and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a seat.
Then make a small incision in the vein to the length of a wide venesection. Then draw out a measured amount of blood, or as much as is necessary for that purpose. Then do the same with the other vein.
Then loosen the ligature and tie both veins tightly in the middle, so that the patient is not suffocated.  And leave it like this until morning. For the wound heals.
§ On the venesection of the veins, according to al-Zahrawi. Al-Zahrawi's venesections are beneficial for treating mouth sores and rotten gums, severe ulcers and lip fissures, as well as those in the nose and around it.
And the method of these venesections is that you should make the patient sit before you and bind their neck with a cord. Then turn the patient's lip inside out and look for the two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and both are distinguishable by their dark color. This is true, because around them there are small, black veins.   Cut both with intersecting cuts.
But if you are in doubt and do not know which one it is: then make an incision into the larger and more prominent of the two.
And do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip; for usually it runs with that one, and make an incision into the two veins that are in the lower lip.
On venesection: The vein under the tongue after a venesection of the cephalic vein. The venesection of the two veins under the tongue is beneficial because the cephalic venesection is for afflictions of the throat, sore throat, and mouth diseases.
And the method of venesection is as follows: let the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; lift up his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein; and both will be dark in color.
Venesection them both; and take care not to finish too quickly when venesecting them. For there are arteries beneath it, and possibly a hemorrhage might occur from those arteries.
The three veins that are venesected in the elbow run with custom in all people. ¶ ・
And their venesection is done in two ways. ・ ・ ・ Either by pricking with a broad myrtle venesection needle, or with an olive wood needle sharpened to a point, or by cutting with a venesection knife, which is called al-nasil. And this is its form:
And from them are wide and thin varieties according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle venesection needle should be broad, as you see. ・ And it is suitable for opening hollow veins, full, protruding, visible, large, and those which contain thick, cloudy blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and more delicate in its ends.
And it is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins that contain fine yellowish blood.
However, the basilic is one of these three veins whose phlebotomy is beneficial. Because it draws blood from the illnesses that are under the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and abdomen: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be careful when phlebotomizing her, because under her there is an artery. If therefore he errs and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur. Therefore it is necessary not to phlebotomize her with the phlebotomy needle; rather let him cut with a lancet.
If the basilic does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is necessary to divert her and change to another [vein], or seek some branch of her; or in place of her phlebotomy, the vein of the arm. For she is manifest, and cut her with the lancet phlebotomy, as we have said.
If you wish to perform the phlebotomy of that same [vein], then it is necessary before constriction of the arm, so that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse. Then mark the place with a cautery, afterwards bind the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the lancet phlebotomy, as we have said. And beware that the blow does not fall through the space from the place of the artery.
When you see, as you tie the bandage, swelling in the place that you marked with a cautery iron, then that swelling is artery swelling: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood spurt like a boy's urine, and it is thin and red, then know that it comes from the artery. Then hasten and place your finger on it for a long time, and then remove your finger. If the blood is cut off (for often it is cut off), then bind the arm and leave it, and let the patient beware of moving it; and let him be very cautious about it.
And he should not move it for several days until it heals.
But if the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and there is no medicine at hand, then cut the artery if it appears to you.  /> Et ligabis eam cum digito: et adiunges super ipsum cataplasma, quae est ex pane farinaceo. For its ends are contracted and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a fig tree and grind it; take one half and bind it over the place of the vein with a suitable bandage, along with threads and small pieces of cloth until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, that's good. And if not, then care for it with the same method mentioned before regarding the dust that cuts off the flow of blood; and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most cases because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of binding it from the arm.
The venesection of the dark vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be above fear of bleeding from her, because under that is a nerve. Therefore if he adds to the puncture of the bloodletting and finds a nerve, it causes numbness in her, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps she does not heal at all.
And this nerve often appears to the senses. But if it is hidden in certain people and is subtle and does not show itself, then you should place your bloodletting where you bleed her, with a section by the Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with all your might.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ Concerning the cephalic vein. But the benefit of bleeding the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases. ↑ Return to text
And it is necessary in this vein, if you wish, that you bleed her by pricking with the olive phlebotomy needle or with the myrtle phlebotomy needle, because it is safer than all the other veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor a nerve. ↑ Return to text
However, it is fitting for you during the bloodletting that you avoid with the phlebotomy needle only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm her if she is not found on the first blow, but rather it is repeated over her several times with the phlebotomy. ↑ Return to text ↑ Return to text
However, perhaps it swells in certain people when she is not found on the first blow, but that swelling does not harm her at all. ↑ Return to text ↑ Return to text
¶ Concerning the usefulness of bloodletting and the precautions that must be observed in it. The quality of bloodletting and its effects are what you should consider in order to correct them.
The first thing you should know is that bloodletting should only be administered for the preservation of health and to maintain its continuance, and as a precaution against the onset of illnesses.
And for bloodletting to be done in one of the three veins located at the elbow: the cephalic, the dark, and the basilic. And bloodletting should be done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in summer and autumn also on an empty stomach; but in winter after eating, when there are signs of fullness.
And let bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since dawn.
However, bloodletting administered for illnesses does not have a fixed time; rather, it should be done whenever the circumstances and necessity dictate, whether at night or day, and at any hour and season.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth to the seventh month. Nor should the elderly, who have already passed sixty years of age, be bled.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the bloodletting with a gentle enema, if there is a large amount of retained feces; so that during the bloodletting, the veins do not draw in putrid waste from the intestines which can harm the principal organs.
Nor should a patient who is feeling nauseous or intoxicated be bled, nor someone who is hungover, until these conditions are removed from them. Nor should a patient with dropsy.
And bloodletting should be avoided again after suffering from colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and anything else that weakens the body or spirit.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that; if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if it is possible for him.
Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents him; or he should be exercised in some manner, so that the blood may be refined.
And place his phlebotomy on the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said; and strive that his chest be evacuated that day from all evil animal passions, such as constriction, anger, and fear; and from all physical evils, such as labor, pain, excess, and similar things.
And he should make present to himself things whose use has become habitual among people because of their fragrance and pleasant smell, such as festivity and similar things, in a quantity suitable for him.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a stool that is higher than the stool for bleeding; afterwards he should extend his arm and rub it himself with his hand two or three times. Then let him tighten the cord with a strap and wind it around twice.
And let the tightness be moderate, for if the tightness is uneven, or too tight, then it hinders the flow of blood; and if too loose, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then after tying, it is necessary that the person to be bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent.
Then let the phlebotomist cleanse the site of bleeding with a small amount of old oil properly.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, a little below the place where he wishes to make the incision, so that the vein does not flee and the blow is steadier. Because the veins are like a fleeing string during bloodletting; and there is one full of airiness; and when you place a lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, deceiving the bloodletter, and the lancet does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is narrow. Therefore, it is necessary that the bloodletter be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should put down the lancet. If the vein is opened on the first attempt, then it is good. And if not, then try it again a little below that place, or above it with haste; if the place does not become swollen.
If it becomes swollen or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two, and let the bandage not be tight. Perhaps indeed a warm poultice will draw out the swelling. He should not enter a bath.
Then he may repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small or the blood runs thinly; and you fear that not as much blood will come out as you wish: then try the lancet again in the same hole, following its straight course, and add a little to your work.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes swollen; for a swollen place is common in many people during a small operation.
If you see that it has already become swollen, then do not try again at all on the same place; for it does not excuse you from anything. And put some olive residue on it; because it relieves the flow of blood. It is better for this purpose than oil itself and than other oils.
And similarly use olive residue in all your bloodlettings, where you hinder the flow of blood; and they do this with theriac of alfarach and with sagzenea, when one of them is placed on the spot.
The blood is refined and dissolved when it is thick.
If an abscess occurs at the site of venesection, which often happens especially to those who are not bled except on that occasion or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly, over the spot: and tighten it for one hour because it dissolves.
And you should do that after the blood has exited from the vein itself, at its completion or from another vein.
If something black or green remains in the spot after a few days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place on it some dissolved aloe or myrrh, or some juice of mint, that is, pennyroyal, or similar to it.
And indeed, abscesses and swellings often occur at the site of venesection on the basilic vein.
Therefore place your hand over it; if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is bad. Beware of placing on it any of what we have said. For perhaps blood from the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with what has an astringent property, so that the spot may harden. Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
And it is necessary to extract from every person a quantity of blood according to his strength. And that which appears from the color becoming over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; and likewise if you see that it is thick, then let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, let its sharpness be taken away.
And he who is full-bodied, strong, and needs a bloodletting once a year, should have the phlebotomy performed on the large vein, and let the phlebotomist be on the side: and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is appropriate to extract him at intervals, and that the opening should be narrow; and it is better that what is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein should be a transverse cut, not a prick.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting the nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy through length and width.
And he who is accustomed to fainting at the time of phlebotomy should eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice, or if he is warm, let him take a drink: and draw blood from him three times, or four.
And if he is of a cold temperament, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in mulberry syrup, or in honey-syrup flavored with spices, or in aromatic fragrant syrup.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause is the loss of much blood, then let him drink meat water and a thin fragrant syrup: and use aromatic spices with aloes, and anoint his chest with them; and use the other things that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
But he who wants to draw blood from his arm and loosen his blood a second time, for him whose phlebotomy is because of much evacuation and whose strength is weak, let him loosen the blood little by little according to the amount of strength, over continuous days.
"Whoever wishes to heal their arm and reduce blood on the second [day], and their body is strong: then let them do it after seven hours or nine from their first phlebotomy.
"But whoever wishes to draw blood from their body toward the opposite side of where it is inclined: it should be treated on the second or third day.
"But in whose body the blood is already heated and sharpened, causing fever to occur: it is necessary that blood be drawn from them once, and a large amount be extracted; and the opening should be enlarged until syncope occurs. After preserving all the conditions of phlebotomy and placing your hand on their pulse along the course of the blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope. "For this often happens when the person drawing the blood is ignorant and careless.
"And it is not appropriate, when one wishes to heal an arm and draw blood on the second day, after the vein's opening has already closed and blood flow becomes difficult, to press hard on it with force and quickly stretch and bend [the arm]. "For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it alone until it is bled the second time.
"Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy the clotted blood from the vein's opening and place on it some salt dissolved in water. "And place on it some of the tyrica al-farukh or sajzeena, and place a gentle pressure on it until the blood comes out.
"But if the vein has already formed an abscess, then leave it alone and do not cover it until the abscess settles.
"But if necessity compels you to draw blood on the second day and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize above that same place or in another arm with another vein.
The vein of the arm is bled in place of the Dark and the Palace, when they are not found or hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the manner of bleeding it is that the sick person puts his hand in warm water until it reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then it should be tied above with a moderately tight knot. Then make the incision crosswise little by little, not widthwise, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that it is made over the wrist slightly.
But if the flow of blood is prevented, then repeatedly put your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve what you need.
However, if it is a summer day, then you may dispense with repeating the hand in warm water. And indeed the running of the blood into hot water is especially useful in wintertime.
And this vein's bleeding is safer than all other veins, because there is neither a pulsatile vein nor a nerve beneath it. 》
However, the bleeding of the little finger on the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of its bleeding is that you tie the little finger with a string or your hand after putting it into warm water until the vein swells and becomes very noticeable to touch. Then make the incision crosswise. And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm it at all.
And be careful not to finish the bleeding while your hand is still being bled. Underneath it are the bare nerves of the fingers, exposed from the flesh. 》 》
Then put your hand back into the warm water and let the blood run into it. For if you do not irrigate it with hot water, the blood clots at the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
So when you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly.
And similarly, you should do this with every tied-off branch.
The remedy for bleeding that vein from the left hand is this: since it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and similarly do for its bleeding as you did for the second one equally.
The remedy for bleeding the saphenous veins is for diseases of the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb and retention of menstrual flow, and kidney disease, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar ailments.  />
And the procedure for bleeding that vein is as follows: let the patient put his foot into hot water and rub it until the veins swell; then tie above the ankle with a bandage. And indeed, the place of that vein is at the heel, visible toward the thumb; and many branches spread out from it on the surface of the foot.
Therefore bleed it either in its larger branch or at the heel where it joins; for this is better and safer.
But if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And place your bleeding wound where you want to bleed it from the side, as if you wanted to cut it; and let the size of the incision be a Nesil.
But if the flow of blood is blocked, then immerse his foot in hot water and allow the blood to flow into it until it is evacuated.
If the bloodletter errs in the first attempt and pierces a vein, he should repeat the phlebotomy slightly higher up, for the place is safe, and you need not fear any harm if you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot evenly.
The place for the sciatic vein, as we have said, is by the heel on the outer side of the foot.
And the benefit of phlebotomy from it is for pain in the ankle when due to hot blood.
And the method of phlebotomy from it is that the patient should enter a bath and be in a hurry; and bind the leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel with four fingers' width, using a fine long bandage, for it does not appear except for this reason.
When it appears, then phlebotomize it by whatever method is possible for you, or by transfusion; and it is better to cut it with a cut or to divide it with a division. For its place is safer, and the vein itself is very hidden in many people.
For its place is safer, and the vein itself is very hidden in many people. If you do not find it and it does not appear to the touch at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, which is that one visible on the back of the foot, towards the little toe; and beware of the nerves, and let as much blood flow as you like.
Then loosen the bandage, and place a piece of skin over the site of the phlebotomy, and bind the site. For it heals quickly.
¶ On Cupping and its Usefulness
Cups are made from horn, from metal, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways. ■ "With scarification and bloodletting: another method is cupping without scarification.
"And this cupping that is without scarification is performed in two ways. "Either it is with fire, "Or it is without fire.
"And cuppings that are administered with scarification and bloodletting are in fourteen places of the body. "One of these is the cupping of Alnocrati, which is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, which are two flat parts of the neck on both sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, which are under the jawbone on the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two ribs; and the cuppings of Alachosos, which are at the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two loins, which are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
"And cupping, indeed, does not extract blood from the small dispersed veins in the flesh; and for this reason, it does not cause weakness as in phlebotomy. "Nor should cupping be administered, whether with fire or without, for any disease that results from fullness until the entire body is evacuated.
"But if necessity requires cupping due to illness or habit, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and at whatever time it may be.
"That is because there are people who, when their blood increases and they need to extract it through cupping, find heaviness and dizziness in their head.
"And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And among them is one who finds itching on his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
And among them is one who scratches the place of his farting. And among them is one whose laughter is increased. And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth; or the tongue swells up and he spits out blood. And among them is one whose sleep is increased. And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to these.
When therefore we see something of these things, and especially if it is in the third week of the month: then we order that a purging be done after two or three hours have passed from the day.
But the relief of purging the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head and what flows out into the eyes. And indeed it is necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body. 》
And this purging takes the place of a phlebotomy of the head.
And it is not permissible for one who has a cold temperament or who has catarrh to use it. 》 For it brings him great harm.
And because of this, it is not right that old people and those who have cold illnesses in the head should use them.
But he who becomes habituated to it generates forgetfulness upon himself.
And because of this, it is necessary to order the purger that he lower his hand with the purging slightly downward, fearing from the cause of forgetfulness. 》 》
The purging called Alkehel is in place of a dark phlebotomy and a basilica phlebotomy, and because of this it helps with asthma, constriction of breath, cleft palate, coughing, and fullness.
And it is necessary that a cupping glass be applied briefly to al-Khayl, because if it is placed lower, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
However, cupping the al-Hadhim area is effective for headaches, migraines, and toothache; it is an alternative to basal phlebotomy.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press his hand on the skin after scarifying, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is effective for mouth ulcers and gum disease, as well as similar oral ailments; it serves as an alternative to phlebotomy of the lip corners.
Cupping with a spoon is effective for al-Khaffakh, which is caused by indigestion and heat.
Cupping the inner parts of the two groins is as beneficial as phlebotomy of the three veins, the basilic, cephalic, and median cubital; for it draws blood from all the small veins in the flesh, which in turn draw from larger veins, until the drawing reaches the three main veins.
And you should instruct the cupper not to cut too deeply when scarifying, since the area is bare of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
A cupping glass placed over the anus is effective for hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
And you should instruct the cupper to use a large cupping glass made of brass, since the area requires strong suction and fine glasses might break; he should also make a deep cut.
Cupping the legs reduces swelling visibly, since it draws blood from the entire body; it relieves old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and uterus, stimulates menstruation, and improves complexion and appetite. It serves as an alternative to phlebotomy of both saphenous veins and the great metatarsal vein. )))
Indeed, they greatly weaken the body and cause fainting in many people.
And the remedy for Ventosarum of the leg is similar to the remedy for Ventosarum of two legs.
The method for applying the Ventosa is as follows: first place the cup on an empty area and apply moderate suction. Do not prolong the position of the cup, but rather place and remove it quickly so that the humors may arrive at the site equally. Continue this process without interruption until you see the site become red and swollen, and the blood appear. At that point, make an incision, and then continue with gradual suction. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For those who have tender flesh and few pores, you should incise once only, no more, so that the site does not become ulcerated.
And instruct the person applying the cups to widen the incision slightly and make it deep enough; they should regulate the suction so that it is gentle, quick, and smooth in motion.
If there is thickening of the blood, then you should incise twice. With the first incision, the way is opened for the thinning and watering down of the blood; with the second, it is subjected to a thorough examination of the thick blood’s extraction.
If, however, the blood is extremely dirty, then a third incision should be made so that it may reach its final state.
And in the end, when we want to extract the blood little by little or briefly, one incision is sufficient for us. If we wish to make many extractions of blood, we should use many incisions.
And if we measure and find that the blood is thick, then it should be incised with a deep incision; and the equal limit of the incision’s depth is the thickness of the skin.
What is that which must be applied from the oils at the site of the Ventosa, and what should the one applying the Ventosa beware of?
IN the case of one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the places to be ventosed be anointed with openings, softening, and dissolving oils: if it is in summertime, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of cucumber seed.
And if it is in wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or savory oil: and similar ones to these.
But if the excess is thick and cold, then it should be bitter orange oil, or balm oil, or alben oil, or dill oil: and similar ones to these.
But if the one to be ventosed has large pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary that he be kept from oil, and it is necessary that these wash the places to be ventosed with rose water, or cold water, or saltwater, or cucumber water, or purslane water: and similar ones to these. 》
But that one whose blood is very moist, should wash the ventosae with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac water: and similar ones to these.
But that one whose excesses are thick, should wash his ventosae with old wine, or sage water, or dill decoction, or chamomile: and similar ones to these.
And it is necessary that the ventosa be applied not in a bath or after a bath; indeed, it should be administered after an hour or two hours have passed since leaving the bath.
And it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after ventilation.
What should be done to ensure that the patient who needs to be ventilated or bled is properly prepared before ventilation?
And after that you should consider first of all: whether the patient who has been ventilated or bled is choleric and if sharpness and inflammation prevail in their blood, then they should receive cooling substances such as pomegranate seeds, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and cucumbers, and jujubes, and similar things. ¶
And make his food soft, and give him cooked mutton, and foods prepared with sour sauce, and similar things.
And if the patient's complexion is cold, it is appropriate for them to take in drink syrup of honey or of almond, and a dessert of seeds; and let them take medium-aged wine that is between old and new; and they should be advised to use little food. And make his food soft, and let him have quails and small birds, and young pigeons is good for him.
And it is appropriate that on the day of ventilation and bloodletting, drink should be more than food; and it is appropriate that in some people's drink, there should be given theriac alfaroch or a medicine from musk, that is muscat, or alesselithe before ventilation: and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood may be refined. And it is not appropriate for them to take it in hot drink.
About ventosas without scarification. But the ventosas which are without scarification are those which are placed on the liver and spleen, and on gout, and on the abdomen, and the navel, and on the places of the kidneys, and on the bladder; because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
And it is not sought through them except either by contact of blood from one member to another, as we place Ventose on the breasts in the disease of nasal blood flow. And we use them to dissolve from the member cold and unseen windiness in the member, as we place Ventose on the belly and navel. For she indeed rarefies the member and heats it and removes the pain for this reason: because she dissolves that windiness.
It is also placed on the kidneys when an obstruction or stone occurs there. For perhaps by the power of its attraction it opens the obstruction or removes the stone from its place.
And similarly when it is placed on the liver and spleen for grinding windiness in both of them.
And these Ventose are applied empty only with a cut. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in diseases of pleurisy: and this is done so that the Ventose may be filled with great hot water alone or with water in which appropriate herbs have been boiled.
¶ The form of the Ventose applied with fire. ¶
Let its opening be two fingers wide as we have shaped it: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be on one of its sides, in the middle part, a small hole the size that can admit an awl: make it from copper or brass, thick-rimmed, smooth, equal, polished so that it does not harm the member upon which it is placed. And let there be in its center a transverse rod of copper or iron where a candle with fire is placed.
And now this Ventose is made large, larger than we have described and somewhat smaller than that one, according to the disease and age of the person using it. ¶
The swellings of boys and emaciated persons are different from those of men and robust bodies.
The manner of applying this swelling with fire upon the member is to light a small wick made from linen or a small wax candle; and place it on the middle of a crossbar that is in the center of the swelling: so that the fire is kindled around the lower part of the swelling, that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Then place it on the member; and let your finger be over the opening that I mentioned, until when we have the swelling in hand; as long as we need it, remove the finger, and steam will come out through that opening, and the swelling will immediately dissolve.
Then extinguish the wick according to its manner, and repeat it, if you need it.
However, in the swelling that is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar nor opening; and it is not applied except when filled with water and placed on the member alone.
And this is its form.
And the larger this swelling is, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
¶ On the suspension of leeches.
Leeches are not applied in many places except those where the position of cupping glasses is not possible due to their smallness, such as the lip and the gum, and similar parts. Or on members that have been stripped of flesh, such as the finger, nose, and similar parts.
And the manner of using them is: that you come from leeches which are in sweet, clean waters free from rottenness. ↑
Then they should be left day and night in sweet water until they are very hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs. Then let the body be evacuated first with bloodletting and with clysters. Then wash the diseased part until it turns red. Then let them be placed on top of it.
When they are filled and fall off, and it is possible to draw the pus with a clyster, then it is more beneficial in the end; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then wash it thoroughly with water, and rub it, and squeeze it out.
But if the bleeding continues after the bloodletting, and it is due to sweating, then soak a cloth of flax in cold water and place it on top until the sweating stops.
But if the bleeding increases, then sprinkle powdered sumac or gall nuts and other astringents on it until the bleeding stops.
Or place half of a peeled bean on the spot and leave it until the beans stick to the spot, for then the bleeding will stop.
And if a repetition of bloodletting is necessary, whenever possible, change the site.
But if leeches are prevented from feeding, then wash the spot with fresh blood. Or prick the spot with a needle until some blood comes out. Then apply them, for when they sense something from the blood, they will immediately stick on.
When you want them to fall off, sprinkle some powdered aloes, or salt, or ashes on them and they will immediately fall off.
This chapter is also very often necessary in the art of medicine, and it deals with the reduction of fractures and dislocations that occur in bones.
Know, O Sons, that the foolish doctors and common people boast about this Chapter without ever having seen an ancient book or read a single letter from it.
And for this reason, this method has been deprived of scientific knowledge in our land. And I never found any good in it at all and did not gain from it what I gained except through the long reading of ancient books and deep study of their meaning until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Then I devoted myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And now I have described to you in this Chapter everything that my knowledge contains on that subject: and what my experimentation has passed over, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the labor of prolongation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviations, and shown it at the end of declinations; and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments used in it, with an addition to declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
Chapter II.
In the prologue of this Chapter, it is fitting to say summaries and headings that compel in the first place the artist to stop on their truth: namely so that you, and those who are eager to learn, may know or learn this noble art from you.
I say, therefore, that when someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or fall, then it is necessary in the first place to hasten to bleed him and purge him, or both together: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or he who suffered one of these things is a boy or an old man weakened by age; or it is a time of very intense heat or very intense cold.
Then let him be content with his food, with cold vegetables, and the meat of birds and goats; and avoid wine, fatty meats, and filling himself with food and all foods that fill the veins with blood. Until you are certain of the heat of the abscess and no longer fear its discharge into the limb, then the sick person should return to his original diet with which he was accustomed.
When the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary for the sick person to eat nourishing foods that are rich, thick, and heavy, with a viscous quality, such as dishes made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads, feet, and intestines of cows, eggs, fresh fish; and fatty wine, and similar things. With this diet, the fracture heals more quickly and better.
And know that the bones of men who are in their prime or decrepit cannot always be joined and healed according to their nature due to the dryness of their limbs; rather, they heal and join like the bones of young children.
However, nature adds something like glue all around the broken bone, which has thickness and holds it together until they are joined to each other and bound together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness as it was in the beginning, so that nothing hinders it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary to give the sick person food that contains heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the kinds of fractures are different according to the diversity of limbs, for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all other limbs are different from each other. And I have come with the description of every kind of fracture exposed in its own chapter, distinguished from others. And various kinds of bone fractures are also distinguished from each other.
Because the fracture is curved, besides which stars occur in it. And sometimes the fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are splinters, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed when it is fitted with a knife for writing. And the ones that do not protrude: and there is a fracture with a wound and tearing at the end; and there is a small crack fracture.
And each type has its own tool or implement for its restoration, as its description will come, distinguished in their respective places.
And from that by which a bone fracture is known is its twisting and protrusion; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
When there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor a sound when you touch the bone with movement, and the patient does not feel great pain, then there is no fracture there; rather, it is possible that it is a slight twist or small crack. Therefore, you should not move it at all with your hand and compression, but place upon it some of the medicines whose description follows after the appropriate time for the place: then let it be bound tightly with a fine bandage.
And know that when a place is curved and divided into two, besides which splinters occur in it, yet every part is separated from its mate; then you should begin at the hour to straighten it, equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs in it, then leave it for some days until the abscess quiets down. Then straighten it by whatever method you can from gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration and alignment are easier than bone, in which fractures occur.
Then tie it according to how you remember it.
But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two parts, whether it is a hand or a foot; either with your hand, if it is a small limb; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb on an even surface according to its natural shape until the parts of the broken limb are extended; then strive with all your skill and in any way you can to return those additions to their places, and take care not to cause pain or injury to the weakened part through your operation. And strive with all your skill to join one of the two bones with its mate according to the best forms.
And it is necessary at that moment for you to test and touch it with your hand. Therefore, if you see something different there, correct it and make it even according to the measure of your skill.
And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do. For often through their operation they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen many times from their operations.
Then bind it after alignment and proper treatment, and the constriction of that limb, and its rest and tranquility; and advise the patient regarding it. And instruct him to take care not to move it during the hours of his watchfulness and sleep, and during his turning and tossing, and during his evacuation, and all his movements with all his might. 》 And to beware that the position of the limb is not one in which pain will follow. What this means is: "When one feels pain or injury in a limb's position and arrangement, it is necessary to change its position to another that does not cause pain.
"And take care with that, so its position is equal and straight; so that when it is restored, the limb does not become twisted.
"And the nature of a fractured limb's constriction is as I tell you.
"Know that fractured limbs are distinguished by their size and shape.
"Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, or cheekbone, then it is necessary for there to be a soft, thin wrapping of cloth. "But those that are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary for there to be a wide, hard wrapping.
"Because a broad bandage secures a large limb and binds it equally from all sides, so that no blemish enters into it.
"Then after your evacuation from equalizing, begin to place an appropriate ointment onto soft tow for the site of the fracture itself. "Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the fracture with three or four turns, according to what the limb deserves; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
"Then go with it to the upper part away from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than your previous binding where you bound the broken place. "Then extend yourself with the wrapping slightly from the site of the fracture and gradually soften the binding until you take something great from the healthy place.
"Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with turns. "Then go with the wrapping to the lower part away from the fracture. And let your operation be on the constriction of the invagination and its softening, as we have said in the first upper invagination.
Then place between the invaginations some soft wool or cloth, which matches the twist of the break, if there is any twist: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Then roll another one on top of that same thread. Afterwards, immediately apply to these invaginations equal and well-made plasters, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in the place.
But if there is swelling or an abscess in it: then place on it that which can settle the abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days. Then bind plasters over it at that time.
And let the plasters be made from half-wide, planed, and wisely shaped reeds; or they may be of wood from which sieves are made, that is, made from pine or gerad, that is, palm branches or calingi; and let the breadth of each plaster be according to this form, and the same shape.
However, it is necessary that the plaster placed on the affected part be a little thicker and wider than the other plasters; and let the length of the plaster be according to what is permitted by the member, in terms of size and smallness.
Then bind another thread over the plasters, with the same first constriction. Then bind over it with fine threads as we have said about the constriction; and it is necessary that your constriction on the place of the break be more, and the farther away from the break it extends, the less the constriction should be.  />
And it is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and let them be from soft linen.
Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the work of foolish people placing their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great mistake; for the constriction with them falls outside of its quality.
And fine threads are not suitable again because you will not achieve through them that which you desire due to constriction.
It is not necessary for the space between star and star to be less than a finger's width.
If the patient is harmed by the tips of the stars after constriction in healthy places, then place under them soft tow or carded wool until no harm occurs from it.
When there is a break with a wound and a disruption of the skin occurs, I will refer back to it in Chapter Two individually.
And know that not every broken bone should be constricted with stars from the first day. That is, because when a bone is large, you should not place stars on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the occurrence of hot inflammation.
And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients used to restore [the limb], which are placed on a break and dislocation.
¶ The abbreviated common method of a restorative plaster for a break, suitable for most complexions, especially women and children: because it is made from that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
It is made by taking the flour of a mill, which is the marrow of flour that hangs on the walls of the mill during the turning of the stone; and make it up just as it is, except that you should sift it with egg white; and place its preparation not thick nor fine. Then use it.
¶ Another method of a plaster restoring a break, dislocation, and twist. Take mastic, and laudanum, and acacia, and elecampane, and mugwort; and the juice of all of them, each 10 drams, myrrh 5 drams, and aloes, both 5 drams, and aleth (i.e., gum tragacanth) 20 drams. Let all be ground, sifted, and mixed with aleth water; or with egg white, if the patient's complexion is hot. Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones and benefits many people.
Another method of the plaster, which also benefits fracture and dislocation. Take mugwort, pennyroyal, and white hellebore, each 10 drams; of myrrh and both kinds of aloes, each 5 drams; acacia, 6 drams; Armenian bole, 20 drams. Reduce all to a fine powder, sift, and mix with water or egg white. Apply it as a plaster.
Method of the plaster for joints and separated bones from their places; and it alleviates the pain that occurs to them, and bone splitting, and fracture. Take freshly shorn wool and soak it in boiled vinegar and oil; then place it on the area.
And indeed this plaster does not have the power of restoration, but it is good for alleviating hot inflammation and properly drives away pain.
Method of the plaster that restores a broken bone. Take leaves of the deaf fig and wild poppy leaves; grind all together and make a plaster from both.
Method of the shortened plaster, applied for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you wish to resolve any remaining inflammation. Take the root of black hellebore, camomile, violet flowers, and grass flour, each one part; grind all together and mix with wine if the limb is not heated.
If it is heated, then mix it with water of fresh coriander or with water and use it.
Another method of a stronger plaster for resolving hard inflammation during the restoration of a limb, stronger than this first one. xspace A recipe of the root of altea, linseed, balaustia, mellilotus, samsuci, violet flower, and chamomile, all taken in equal parts. Grind everything and prepare with willow water or sweet water or wine. All of this according to the heat of the limb and the stillness of its heat.
Hippocrates however did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration except a plaster made of wax and oil; nothing else, and he reported that it is a middle ground between coarseness and fineness.
But Galen thought that things should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration which contain the drying of heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and similar things from those which we have mentioned.
The manner of a poultice that helps with injury and pain. Take mugwort and chickpeas, and human hair that has been cut or bird feathers, and altea, and salt in equal parts; grind them and sift them and make a poultice from it.
The quantity by which it is necessary that the binding should remain, then be loosened, is this: you must see if no pain or itching happens to the patient, and the broken bone does not move from its place; then do not loosen it for many days. But if intense itching or troubling pain or swelling happens to him, then hurry and loosen it right away, and remove the poultice from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft sponge moistened with water, and dip it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching quiets down and the pain is soothed.
But if intense itching or troubling pain or swelling happens to him, then hurry and loosen it right away, and remove the poultice from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft sponge moistened with water, and dip it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching quiets down and the pain is soothed. Then let the limb rest for one hour. Then place upon it a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil; and bind it on for one night, until you are secure from hot swelling, the limb's swelling subsides, and its pain is relieved.
Then apply to it a fine bandage and a small plaster; and do not bind it too tightly at first, but keep the bandages loose with it until it heals.
If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and you no longer need plasters or bandages, then bind it as you did at first, evenly.
If nothing happens to the limb as we have said, then do not remove it before three days, or four, five, or seven. And when it is removed after twenty days, the whole thing according to what you see from the unwrapping of the limb, as we have said, until the bone has healed and the flesh has coagulated over it: add also then to the bandage more than your first entire bandage; and add also in feeding the patient, as his strength returns.
But if you see the place of the break becoming excessively dry and thin: then know that the nourishment is being prevented from reaching it. Moisten it with warm water every time you unwrap it, and let that be for all three days, and slightly loosen the bandage.
By this procedure the nourishment reaches the limb and it heals quickly.
The foolish restorers who do something else with a broken limb when it is not set correctly at first, and then set it crookedly, are making an error in their procedure and have great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books and would have practiced thus.
And I have not seen any trace of them there at all, and it is better that it should not be done.
On the making of a swelling on the head.
The kinds of fracture are various, and its shapes many; and its causes are distinct.
For there is a type of fracture which happens from a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone entirely to where it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood; and because of this, this type of fracture is named Axial. 
Or the sword strikes something of the bone, and it strikes its surface but does not penetrate as far as its end; and this type of fracture is named Kalaan, that is, Clean Incision.
And there are two types of fractures, either large or small.  
And there is a type of fracture which is a crushing or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or falling onto a stone, or similar things.
And this type of fracture can also be either penetrating, which is near the panniculum that is under the bone; or it can be on the surface of the bone; and there are two types of wounds from these two fractures: either small or large.
And there is a type of fracture which is hidden in the bone as fine as hair; and it is a small crack; and because of this, this type of fracture is named Hairline.
And among these is the type of fracture which happens from a fall or blow with a stone and similar things, which cause a layer of bone to sink into its depths, and a depression occurs; just as happens in copper pots when they are struck, and part of them goes inside.
And this happens most often in the heads of soft bones, such as children's heads.
And for all these kinds of fractures, splints are separated out, and I will come with the recollection of that entire thing in its place.
And we know all these kinds of fractures by examination of them, and investigation with probes, and removal of the corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Moreover, the hairy kind is known by this: it is uncovered on the bone, and it is cleansed and anointed with wax upon it; for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the conditions of the patient; then if you see from his condition something that clearly indicates danger, such as choleric vomiting, distension, loss of consciousness, hoarseness, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, their redness, and similar symptoms in various constitutions, certainly he will not be cured; but if you see conditions that do not frighten you and you hope for a cure, then begin his treatment.
That is, if a wounded man comes to you first when he is wounded; and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every constitution.
And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest that which is under the bone from the membrane be corrupted and those symptoms which we have mentioned occur.
But if the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain and is accompanied by fragments and swelling; then it is necessary that you cut away the crushed and swollen part, as I tell you.
And it is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded man and uncover the bone in whatever way possible for you; according to the shape of the wound and what is easy for the patient.
If there should be a flow of blood or a hot swelling while exposing the bone, then apply to it what is needed. And it is that you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the swelling subsides and you are secure from bleeding. Then begin with the cure of the bone and its removal.
And this is done according to one of two methods.
Indeed, the first method is that you cut the bone with a trephine of sharp edge, and this is its form.
Then administer another trephine after the first one, which is wider by a little bit, and this is its form.
Then also administer another trephine wider than the second one.
And the second method is that you have with you a number of different trephines, some wider than others and some shorter than others, and at their ends they are sharpened, and they are made from iron or steel. Use skill in striking on the trephine so that it does not shake the head and harm it.
But if the bone happens to be hard and tough, then you should bore around it with non-penetrating trephines called non-penetrating trephines, and they are not so called except because they do not pass through to the end of the bony part that is behind it; because the extremity of the trephine is rounded on what is under its sharp point, similar to a small circle, and it prevents sinking in and passing through the thickness of the bone. 》
And it is fitting for you to take from these trephines a great number, each of which fits the thickness of the bone, until you have a trephine for every skull, whose length and shortness of its sharp extremity is according to the thickness of that skull.
And these are the forms of three types of trepans, or trephines.
The quality of penetration around the broken bone is such that you place the trepan on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated. Then change the trepan to another place and put it between every opening a quantity equal to the thickness of the radius, or about that.
Then cut with the chisels that which is between every opening from the bone and make it thinner than you can above that to the limit of thinness, as we have said, until you extract the bone either by hand or with some other of the instruments which you have prepared for that purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
And you must be very careful that the trepan or chisel does not touch anything of the brain.
Therefore, when you have circled the bone by penetrating and separated it from the brain, if it is continuous with it and you have extracted it, it is necessary to scrape and smooth the remaining end of it in the bone with another similar instrument like a chisel. However, it must be thin and more delicate than other chisels.
If there remains anything of the small fragments and splinters then take it easily with one of the instruments which you have with you. Then care for the wound afterwards with the linen cloths and ointments which we have mentioned.
And there is another method of operating which is completely free from danger, as Galen said and praised it greatly, saying this: It is necessary for you first to begin exposing the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and evident until, when you have exposed that part and placed under it the end of this lenticular chisel, whose form is as follows:
And the lens-shaped part, which is soft and does not cut anything, and its pointed part on both sides of it going along the length, as you see, so that the lens-shaped part rests against the cheek, with its pointed end striking the bone.
Then strike the jaw from one side with a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone easily, as I have shown: and you should be confident that nothing will happen to it that you fear at all.
And if the doctor were not more foolish than other men and less ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off from there with the pointed end of the lens-shaped instrument itself, and free it easily. For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
And if the bone's fracture does not reach to the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and fine splinters remain in it; then you must scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine scrapers of various sizes which you have prepared, so that you can use from them the most suitable and straightest ones for each place, according to what the operation requires, and the broken bone itself, and its shape. 》 And you must use first, with those scrapers, a broader one to scrape the bone. Then use a finer one after that.
And you must use first, with those scrapers, a broader one to scrape the bone. Then use a finer one after that. And do not stop doing this continuously until you reach using the thinnest and finest of all.
But in each of the remaining small hairline cracks and fine fractures, you must take care to straighten it according to what is needed for that.
And it is a matter that is not hidden to anyone who has any interest in this art, and we have written about it and demonstrated it in the case of large fractures.
But if the skin flap remains attached when you pull out a tooth: then you should take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the opening of the wound. Then take another piece of linen cloth, folded double or triple, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth: and make that as easy as possible on top of it, so that it does not cause pressure.
Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds only the wound; and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are sure of avoiding hot inflammation. Then remove it and apply afterwards medications that are dry in nature, such as lily roots, henbane seed flour, frankincense powder, birthwort, and similar to these: and this is how you make a powder from these medications to be dusted on the wound like dry substances.
And universally apply on it every medication that has the property to cleanse and not to bite. And be careful according to your ability that the wound is clean in your treatment: and there is no dirt from oil or grease in it.
And be careful according to your ability that the wound is clean in your treatment: and there is no dirt from oil or grease in it. And do not allow pus to accumulate on it at all: for when pus accumulates on the skin of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, and a great evil happens to the patient afterwards; and this often happens with siphac of the head, when the bone is cleansed from it, especially when its care is neglected, a blackness appears on its surface.
"Therefore, if such events occur to the patient, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
And if the blackening does not occur except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make that blackness: then you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and soak a cloth with them. Then place it on the sore; afterward, treat it with appropriate remedies until it heals.
"On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
"Know that only two parts of the nose can be broken at once or one of them: because there are two bones in it. The lower part is cartilaginous and cannot break; it only sustains rubbing, twisting, and compression.
If one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and with your index finger and thumb on the outside, adjust the fracture until the nose returns to its natural shape; this should be done skillfully and easily. And be careful that during your operation no pain occurs to the patient.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then you should use the end of a small bone with some thickness to adjust it.
If the fracture is in both parts, then do the same; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture if possible. 😊 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day when the swelling has abated.
Then insert a cloth plug made of linen into the tip of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two plugs if the fracture is in both parts: and let the thickness of the plug be such that it fills the nostril.
And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be infused with linseed in butter and changed every day. That, however, does not seem right to me; rather, linseed should be infused with the white of an egg, made into a powder. Then leave the linseed until the bone hardens and the cartilage thickens.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of linseed, after it has been wrapped with soft cloth; this holds the broken nose more firmly and allows the patient to breathe without obstruction.
And this is not necessary. If you want, do that; and if you want, do linseed.
But if the nose swells again while you are treating an abscess, apply a plaster to the nose with ketron or cotton soaked in rose oil or a little dyacon.
But if the abscess does not swell again, then you should apply plasters made with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white. Then place soft wool on it, and do not bind the nose at all.
But if the bones of a small broken nose are fractured or shattered, then you should cut open and extract them with suitable instruments. Then either stitch it up or care for it with what promotes healing and consolidation from suitable plasters or ointments.
But if there is a wound between the nose and lip, then you should treat it with linseed poultices; and insert a lead tube until it heals.
¶ On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and there is no wound: observe then if the fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two pieces but bends towards the inside; then its diagnosis is easy.  /> If, however, it breaks into two pieces, its diagnosis is difficult, except for when one piece is missing.
Therefore, if there is a fracture on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, then insert your right index finger. And with it, push the swelling of the fracture from within to the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and make it even with that.
If the mandible is already divided into two parts, then it is necessary to administer traction from both sides in a straight line until equalization becomes possible.
However, if there is displacement or separation of the teeth, then tie them with gold thread, silver thread, or silk from which you hope they will remain. Then place a bandage on the fractured mandible. Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, well-made spica over the cloth, or a piece of sole skin equal in length to the mandible.
Then bind it on top according to how its bandage is prepared and the application of it is suitable until it does not fall apart; and instruct the patient to be calm and at rest, and give him soft food.
However, if you think that the shape has changed in any way, then hurry and remove it on the third day. Then correct what has changed from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour after you have removed the bandage; and place soft wool over the plaster.
Therefore, while that plaster remains attached to it and the arrangement of the bone does not change, leave it unremoved until healing occurs; or bind the fracture. Indeed, this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
If a hot abscess should occur in the meantime, then administer what we have often said for its relief until that abscess is removed.
And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider this: For if already a fragment has separated from the bone, or from the saw: then be skillful in this, that you remove those fragments of the saw with what is suitable to you for their removal among instruments.
But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a fleam according to your need.
Then when you have removed the saw fragments and none of them remain, or if the opening of the wound is wide; and if not, place on it one of those plasters which are suitable for it, and let it grow flesh until it heals.
¶ On Restoring a Clavicle When It Is Broken
Indeed, a clavicle is most often broken from the anterior part of the arm, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Or it breaks and separates into two parts, besides which fragments may occur in it: and that is easier to restore.
Or so, that fragments occur in the bone: and that is more difficult to restore. 》
Or it may be a fracture with a wound.
And the operation in it when there is a fracture without a wound is to have present two assistants, so that one of them holds up what follows the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Then make the fracture equal with your fingers until it takes its proper shape: and there should not be any prominence or depression in it.
If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's armpit a sphere of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and squeeze the sphere with your hand until you make the fracture equal, as is necessary. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
If you cannot pull the end of the fork to the outside, because it has reached the depths, then the patient must be turned onto their back; and place a medium-sized cushion under their shoulder, and have an assistant press down on the shoulder until the fork bone that is deep inside comes up. Then set right the fracture, and make it even with your fingers.
If you feel a splinter from the fork and it moves, then you should scrape over it and extract the splinter easily.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then make an incision over it with one of the knives you have prepared for this purpose. After placing under the fork a tool that preserves the marrow; and this tool should be made of wood or iron. And this is its shape.
It resembles a spoon without the hollow part.
And its width should be according to your need, based on the size and thinness of the bone. The length of it should also be as much as is possible for you to work with.
And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
But if the wound that you made when you extracted the bone splinter is wide and free from any hot inflammation, then join the two lips of the wound with a stitch.
And if the wound is small or you fear a hot inflammation, then fill the wound with cloths and soft wool according to the size of the cut in the wound.  \\*  \\
But if a hot inflammation occurs, then dip a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the wound.
A narrowing of the bone without a wound or cut is treated by placing on the bone an ointment made from flour and egg white.  \\*  \\  \\*  \\ And place soft wool over it. Then place a sphere under his nipple, if you need that. Then take a roll of cotton, which is what the Saracens use, and let it be very long; its width should be that of one palm, or about that. Then place two layers of soft cloth over the wool and the plaster. Then take a small wooden board, whose width is three fingers, and likewise in length. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the board in the place of the himema which falls over the break and the wound. Then place the himema over the break as it is wrapped, and wrap it around his neck, under his sound nipple, and under his afflicted nipple; and bring it back over all the parts, so that the bandage holds the break firmly in place: and this should not be hidden from you, and all of it, so that the board is not removed from the broken part. And for this reason, you must look at the patient every day. Whenever the bandage becomes loose and you see that the board has moved, then correct it and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and put under his sound nipple, near his sleep, a small pillow at night, so that with it his help will be lifted from his side. Therefore, the break of the collarbone is healed by lifting the arm.
Or bind his arm to his own neck; and do not loosen the bandage, unless it happens in that place from itching or swelling, for twelve days.
Then renew the plaster, if you see his face turning to it. And add to the bandage, and leave him alone until he is healed and solidifies.
And indeed the fracture of the collarbone is tied and strengthened for the most part within twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some people within a shorter period.
On the treatment of a fractured rib.
Rarely is a rib broken, and only in its broad part; from it, only its edges are broken.
So when it is broken in that place and is broken in the middle of it and is not known except by touch, then prepare it according to the shape of the fracture. And reduce it to its natural shape by every means possible for you.
Then place on the site powder of ground linen seed with the membrane of an egg and soft tow and place a little cloth from a doubled garment over it. Then place on it a broad splint made of thin wood according to the size of the whole rib, or slightly larger than that.
If however there is any hollow under the splint in some part of the rib, then even it out with soft tow until the splint descends to an equal level.
Then tie it over with a long bandage of appropriate tightness and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place. ︎
And examine the bandage every day. Whenever therefore the bandage becomes loose, tighten it and even out the splint if it has moved from its place; and let the patient lie on his sound side. ︎ ︎ ︎
And a rib is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
Therefore when this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and you should be secure. For it [the rib] is of bones whose grinding is not feared, nor their dissolution.
But if a piece of bone protrudes and stings under the skin, then cut over it and remove it. And do what we said regarding a fracture of the collarbone from inflammation, if something happens due to that.
¶ On the restoration of a breast fracture.
The breast is sometimes broken in its middle, and this happens rarely. Its extremities are most often broken and crushed due to injuries.
When its middle is broken and it leans towards the lower part, a severe pain occurs, along with difficulty in breathing and coughing; and sometimes blood may be vomited, and there will be a concavity in the fractured bone, which will not escape notice. The treatment for this is to have the patient lie on his back; place cushions under his shoulders. ething
Then press his shoulders and bring the ribs together from both sides with your hands; and adjust it in equilibrium as much as possible and is suitable until the shape of the bone returns to what is necessary.
Then place a plaster and tow on him; then put a board made of thin willow or linden, or similar light materials on top after you wrap it in cloth. Then adjust the bandage over the fractured bone so that it does not move; and pass the bandage around to the back several times, tightening it with a proper tightness. ething ething
Then inspect the bandage every hour and whenever it loosens, tighten it; and if its necessity calls for its release due to itching or ulceration that occurs in the place, or pain, or inflammation, then hurry and release it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with its treatment method. ething
Then reapply the plaster if you see it is needed; and fasten it with a bandage until it heals.
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that the fracture of ribs does not occur except in the thick parts that follow the spine and from their ends on the anterior part. And abrasion does not happen to them except because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses when examined with the fingers.
And its restoration is done by evening out the fracture with the fingers to the extent possible, until the shape becomes even as it should be. Then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage if it needs it.
If the fracture of the ribs is slanted towards the inside: then a very severe pain and sharpness occurs to the patient, like that puncture which occurs in pleurisy; because the bone pricks the membrane. And also difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood occurs. This is difficult to cure.
And the ancients have devised many ingenious methods for it; among them are those who say that you should give food to the patient which generates inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed and extended, and the fracture pushed outwards. )))
But we ourselves detest it, lest a quick cause be made for producing a hot abscess, if it has not happened already. If however it has already occurred, then it adds to it.
And some of them have said: a cupping glass should be placed on the location, then drawn out with force, and this is similar to reasoning. ))) However, it must be feared that the cupping may draw superfluities to the location because of the weakness of the condition. ))) )))
And some of them have said: the location should be covered with wool which has already been soaked in hot oil, and small pieces of cloth should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that there may be an equal bandage when you wrap it around according to its roundness. ))) ))) ))) )))
Then let the patient be treated with a diet and medicine for pleurisy.
If a strong force constricts the patient and he cannot tolerate it, and the skin is pricked with a wounding puncture, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we cut open the place and expose the broken rib. Then let us place on it an instrument that conserves the siphon, of which we have previously spoken; and let us cut the skin easily, and let us cut into it.
Then we will bring together the two lips of the wound with a stitch, if it is large; and we will treat it with plasters until it heals.
If it happens that a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then hasten and pour powder into rose oil, and place it on the spot; and let the patient be treated with what is suitable for an abscess.
In the meantime, he should also be turned onto his side where he sleeps, until it heals.
¶ On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Fracture indeed sometimes happens to the bones of the neck, and rarely do they suffer attrition; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back. Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will heal or not heal, then make an examination. For if you see his hands already softened and insensible and dead; and he cannot move them or stretch them out, or draw them back together; and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and there is no pain in them: then know that he will not heal, and in many dispositions it is fatal.
But if he moves them and feels the pressure with his fingers and the prick: then know that the bone of the neck is sound, and that the patient will heal with treatment. ‌
If it happens similarly in the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet: if you see that they have become soft, and the same thing happens to them as happened to the hands; when he lies on his back, flatulence and evacuation occur involuntarily; and when he is turned onto his stomach, evacuation occurs involuntarily; and when he is turned onto his back again and wishes to urinate but cannot, then you should know that it is fatal. Therefore, do not labor over his cure.
If, however, nothing of this kind happens to him, the case is less serious.
And the treatment for what has happened is to try to reduce the hot swelling in this way: place crushed rose oil alone on the vertebra, or mixed with cooked egg yolks.
Apply this to the site several times a day until the hot swelling is reduced; then place one of the strengthening plasters on the spot, and bind it tightly with a bandage. Advise the patient to rest quietly. Let him not sleep on the part where he finds pain until it is healed.
If the bone has been splintered or something that has already separated from it occurs; then it is necessary to open the skin and remove it. Then join the two lips of the wound with a stitch if it is large. Then treat him with some healing ointment until he heals.
If the last bone of the tail is broken, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus and align the broken bone with your other hand as best you can, and make another alignment.  />
Then place it on top and remove it; and treat the wound with the preceding treatment until it heals.
About the restoration of a hook.
Chapter XI.
The bones of hooks rarely break. If they do break, then their fracture is not complete, but rather a comminuted fracture at the ends themselves; and they split along their length and bend towards the inside; and there occurs pain in the area and a puncture wound; and the affected leg becomes numb.
And its restoration is as follows: extend your hand over it until you stand above the fracture so that you can see its shape.
If the fracture is only at its ends, then equalize that fracture with what you have prepared from the equalization, until it resembles its natural shape.
However, if the fracture is along its length or has already bent towards the inside, then have the patient lie on his back until you prepare for the restoration of that fracture. When you have equalized it, place a plaster on it; then place on it a splint made of wood or skin, and bind it tightly with a bandage that will not cause displacement of the fracture or dislodgement of the splint.
And fill the concavity of the bones with what will fill it until the bandage takes it up evenly; and instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his sound side.
If a hot abscess forms on it, then cease from extending and restoring it until the hot abscess is settled; and place upon it what will settle it, as was mentioned before, and then return to its restoration; and bind it as is necessary.
If however a fragment of bone is driven into it or it becomes comminuted, extract it.
The restoration of a broken elbow.
The elbow is that part which is between the bend of the arm and the head of the ulna.
If it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, in the following shape.
And two ligaments are tied at both ends.
Then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a seat. ➤ Then he throws his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its tip, in whose middle is attached the curvature of the wood.
Then something heavy is hung above it, so that the servant extends downwards. ➤ ➤ Then the physician straightens the break with his hands at the same time, until the break returns as it should. ➤ ➤ ➤
The other method is that the patient lies on his back with his head hanging over the edge of the bed. And the hand is suspended from the neck with a ligament. Then instruct two assistants to hold the one above the break with their hands, and the other below it, and each of them pulls towards his own side.
And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tie with a ligament below the break and above it with another ligament, and each of the two assistants pulls towards his own side.
If the break is near the end of the arm, then a ligament should be placed under the tip, and another under the break towards the elbow. ➤
And similarly, if the break is near the elbow, then a ligament should be placed over that place and over the elbow itself. ➤ ➤ ➤
Then straighten the break with ease and without difficulty, until when the break is straightened as it should be and a good bandage is applied, then tie it if no hot swelling occurs. ➤ ➤ ➤ ➤
If indeed a warm abscess occurs, then release the constriction until the seventh day. And place on it a wool swab soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides; then constrict it. And the way to constrict it is that you should place a plaster over the break.
Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster. Then gather the arm to the support itself and place his open hand on his shoulder.
And place a cloth and bind it on the support of the arm, so that the arm may stand in place of crutches; if nothing prevents you from this, nor will anything be changed upon you from the broken bone.
But if you fear that something will change upon you from the broken bone, then use crutches; and it is as if you place on the very break a crutch which is wider and stronger than the other crutches. And place between each crutch a width of one finger; and let the length of the crutches be according to the break with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Then bind over the crutches the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your bandage should be tighter on the place of the break. And the more the break is lengthened, let the bandage be less.
Therefore, if you see the placement of the crutches and the bandage as we have said in the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do: and if you fear a warm abscess, then release the bandage and crutches until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then examine the bandage for three days to see if there is no itching or swelling in the place, or if food is prevented from reaching the limb because of the arrangement of the bandage. Therefore, correct all that as we have said.
If indeed it is due to a hernia, so that nothing should happen from it: then do not release the ligature until after three days or more.
And let the patient lie on his back, and place his hand on his abdomen; and put under the pillow a cushion filled with wool evenly.
And be careful at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb not be disturbed, or that the ligature become loose. Therefore correct it all with your strength.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have mentioned earlier, so that the first food be fine; and continue this until the mouth begins to close up; then it is necessary to thicken his food.
For the custom of the pillow and the leg is to be tight for forty days; therefore, it must then be released, and a bath should be administered, and it should be treated with ointments that correct it.
If the fracture is foul and crushed, then do not remove from it the ligature or splints until after fifty days, or two months.
About the restoration of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two forearm bones.
Of these, one is small; and it is that which follows the thumb. And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the smaller from below.
Therefore perhaps only the larger forearm bone breaks, or perhaps only the smaller one; and perhaps they both break together.
Therefore when the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the forearm bone is broken below, it is a bad break, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that, it is when the two bones are broken together.
If therefore the bone which is broken is slightly higher up, then it is suitable for the physician in restoring it to place a slight extension with ease, until he aligns it.
If however the bone that is broken is large, then it is necessary to place a very strong constriction.
And it is necessary to place the hand form for its restoration, and that extension extended over the elbow. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be lower than all the fingers or the rest; and let the sitting sick person be square with himself, and let the elbow be before him or straight with him, in height so that the sick person does not fall into labor.
Then let the assistant stretch the arm from the lower part, either by his hand or with a bandage. And another assistant should stretch it likewise from above.
Then let the physician align the bone until he restores it to its best shape as possible. ➤
And if there are fragments in the bone's break, then strive to restore each piece to its own place with your strength.
But if a separated fragment appears in it, and pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration; then cut over it, and remove it according to the manner we have said above among those things which are premised. ➤
But if the break is with a wound, I have already made for it a separate chapter; therefore take its treatment from there.
But if a hot abscess happens at the beginning of your restoration, then place a cloth made with salve from rose oil and white wax, and let its thickness be between thinness and thickness; and bind the cloth over it with a fine constriction, until the abscess settles down. Then remove the salve and place a prepared plaster made from flour of millstones with egg whites. Then place a splint, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether the fracture is in one third or two thirds simultaneously.
Then place your bandage over the fracture site stronger and more firmly, and slightly longer than the bandage at the upper part of the fracture or its lower part: or place a softer bandage for a moment, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft, moist: and not hard, rough. And let the thread with which it is tied be of proper linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
And consider the limb and ligament after days. If something happens which requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then you should anoint the limb with heated water until the itching subsides, and leave the limb unbound until it subsides, then repeat the bandaging.
But if the bandage is already softened and the bone is already moved, and similar [conditions]: then correct all of it with your skill, and examine again.
For if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to the excess of bandaging, then you should soften it slightly and leave it for several days until the nourishment reaches it, then bind it again.
But if nothing of those things that we mentioned happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen [the bandage], unless after twenty days or thereabouts.
Then let the hand of the patient be suspended from his neck. And let his neck be level and guarded with skill from sudden movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days; and it may be restored in twenty-eight days. All of that depends on the temperament of the constitution and the strength of the individual.
¶ On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Know that a fracture of the metacarpals and the interphalangeal joints of the fingers is rare. And it does not happen unless there has been much attrition.
When therefore a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the invalid sits with his legs extended, and before him there should be a seat of equal height. Then place his hand on top of it, extended.
Then the assistant should stretch the broken bones and the physician should make them even until they join with a good union.
Then it is necessary to place a plaster and tow on it, if no hot abscess occurs. Then place a bandage on top according to the size of the place, and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.  ·
But if the fracture is in the lower part of the sole, then make something similar to a sphere from cloth; and instruct the invalid to press it with his broken sole; then let it be tied with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that it may be applied to the body of the sole; and tie it as necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place one bandage on top and another below on the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. Then place a tie as the hand is wrapped; and stretch between the fingers with a bandage.  ·  ·
If a fracture occurs to any of the interphalangeal joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be made even as necessary.  ·  · Then let it be strung with a thin cord, and if you wish, place a small straight splint on it, so that the break may be lifted up and not move about.
If the fracture is in one of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, ring finger, or little finger, then it should be made equal and tied to the healthy finger following it; or all of them can be tied together according to their continuation, and this is better. Or place a small splint upon it, as we have said concerning the thumb.
And take into account in your restoration and after the initial arrangement of the warm swelling; and do what is necessary when something happens because of it, according to the recurrence of its narrative.
¶ On the Restoration of a Fractured Hip.
The hip bone is often broken and it becomes apparent to the sense because it turns toward the interior and posterior part.
And its restoration is done thus: that a ligament be placed above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture. And the patient should be laid on his face. }}}
Then let the assistant stretch every ligament to its corresponding part equally; and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
But if the break is near the root of the hip, then let one ligament be to the pubis bone so that the extension may fall upward; and another ligament below the fracture.
And in a similar way if the break is near the knee, then let one ligament be near the knee so that the extension may be toward below.
Then let the physician make the bone equal with both of his hands until he brings it back to its natural form; and let the bone be joined with a good union.
Then it is necessary that you place a plaster and bandage on it if there is no swelling of the limb. }}} If an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for some days until the abscess becomes hot, then return to your treatment.
Its constriction should be thus. It is necessary that you roll upon the fracture a thick bandage, that is, a binding, and fold it double or triple, and let there be some excess from it. Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the base of the big toe.
And introduce a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee on the lower side, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part in two places. Then wrap the excess of the bandage over the leg and hip.
Then place on the hip in the place of the fracture itself a bandage, and from it place one bandage over the bone of the leg.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the constriction may be equal.
Then begin with a strong constriction from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four windings.  /> And as you extend more with the bandage from the place of the fracture, let your constriction be smaller and softer and gentler.
Then pull on the two ends of the thread that you introduced between the hip and leg.  /> Tie therefore with both three bandages which are above. Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower part until you reach the ankle bone of the foot. And with both tie also the ends of the bandages on the other side, so that the bandage may not be moved from its place.  />
Then leave the constriction upon it while it remains, so that no rotting, nor abscess, nor swelling, or things similar to these may occur in the limb. If something from this occurs.  /> Therefore, hasten with its treatment, and correct whatever has happened because of it entirely, as we have said many times.
If there is a fragment of bone that is causing pain: then you must smooth it out if possible. And if not, cover it with something and remove it; and treat it as was mentioned before, until it heals.
And sometimes this hip fracture is bandaged, apart from what was added to it as we said for the thigh and arm.
However, when this sort of broken bone is healed, the patient does not limp. And if it is healed alone, without the other leg being attached to it, then it is necessary that the person always limps.
And know that the hip is bandaged for fifty days, or less if it is added to or reduced too little; all this depends on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
¶ On the healing of a patella fracture of the knee.
Know that a fracture of the patella rarely happens, but it is often bruised.
If it does happen to be fractured, then it is only either a crack or a hole in its parts. And this can occur with a wound and without a wound. And a cast is placed over it entirely while it has feeling. ・
And its healing is such that the broken parts are made equal with the fingers, until they unite and join together as much as possible through equality and ease of handling.
Then place a plaster made from sesame flour or wheat flour with egg white on it; and if you need one, put a round bandage over it; and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage. ・ ・
Then consider all the conditions that we have described for other fractures; such as a hot abscess and others like it; so that you may counteract every incident with what is suitable for it until it heals.
"On the repair of a broken leg.
You should know that the leg has two bones. One is thick and is called by the name of the leg, while the other is thin and is called the fibula.
And it happens to both types of fractures that happen to the two bones of the arm, and for this reason its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.
But if both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned towards all parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned toward the front.
And if the thicker bone is broken, it will be found lower down; and this is one of those things which are not hidden from you.
Then apply traction, and reduction, and bandaging of the bones in the same manner as described before. 》
However, if the fracture of the leg is a dirty fracture with many wounds, you should make the traction less and gentler in your reduction.
And in the case of the leg, there is something different from the arm: that when you have made the bones equal and completed all your work, then take two strips of pine wood that are used for making floors, which are placed under boards, and are made from a shovel's width. Choose those that have a small thickness and are not too thin; their length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards. 》
Then wrap each strip with two layers of cloth along its length. 》 》 And place one part on one side of the leg and the other on the opposite side; they should extend from the knee to below the foot.
Then tie the two strips in three places: at both ends and in the middle. 》 》 》 》 When the stricture is blocked, the leg turns towards the right and left, and it stands in a good position.
And now indeed let a cradle be administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may preserve it from motion.
And indeed it is very important to do this in a fracture when there is also a wound properly [with the fracture].
Then observe the leg every day, and study it with the utmost care against swelling or inflammation or other things. If therefore any of these things happen, then apply to it what is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
On the Fracture of the Bones of the Foot and Toes.
Indeed, a fracture does not occur in the heel at all.
A fracture occurs indeed in the bones of the foot and in the toes only rarely, and it does not occur in them except as a bruise in many dispositions.  ()
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones being raised over each other, then let the sick person place his foot on prepared ground as if walking.
Then stand and place your foot on that part which is raised from those bones; afterwards press or tread it down and make it even until it returns to its place.
Then apply a poultice and wool on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board that has two flat ends.
Then bind it with a decent bandage after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that are needed.
Therefore, when three or four days pass for him, then release the bandage. For you will find the bones leveled out, whether they were broken or dislocated. The operation on them is as you see.
But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal as I have told you in the restoration of the hand's fingers. Then place a finger-shaped splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider; then place under the foot the board I have told you about, and bind it with a decent bandage.
But if the broken parts are two or three or more, then place a splint of appropriate size on each finger wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the lower board under the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the belly of the foot so that it may hold well in position.
And it is fitting for you not to forget to consider all that I have said to you concerning other breaks from the injuries we mentioned: and counter each injury with what is appropriate.
¶ Concerning the break of a woman's vulva, and the bone of the pubis, and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit upright. Then slightly lean her back toward her own back, and let her be held from behind.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let there be in the vulva from this as if a sphere.
Then let the woman be shaken, and gradually raise up her back. /> For that cotton comes out until it is at the vulva's entrance like a sphere, and the broken part returns.
Then place a small pillow behind her back. When she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease; then let her urinate; and put it back in the same way you first inserted it; then let her return to her original pillow.
Do this for seven days, or thereabouts, so that the wound itself may be restored.
And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep and tie a small reed tube over its opening, then insert the entire bladder into the wound. Then blow through the tube with strength until the bladder inflates within the wound, for the broken bone will return to its place.
Then fill it with cotton and let it remain for several days, as we have said, until it heals.
And when the rib of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and alignment that which we have mentioned regarding the jawbone.
And there is no secret in these nearby fractures that hardly touch each other, especially for those who have some knowledge or skill.
And understand this book of mine well, for the fracture itself indicates to you the correct way in its restoration and union in many arrangements; therefore, understand.
But when a man's penis is broken, take the neck of a goose and insert the penis into it. Then place a bandage of cloth over it and bind it, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it.
About the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is appropriate for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or thigh bone, or similar to that, to hasten and bleed them immediately: if the conditions of bleeding are evident to you, as we have said previously.
If the wound bleeds, then you should hasten to cauterize it by applying powdered myrrh over it: if nothing else is available.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad things to happen to it.
But if the broken bone is protruding and visible through the skin: then you should try to reduce it and make it even with your hands, using ease and slight extension.
But if its extension and equalization by hand are not prepared: then reduce it with this instrument. And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is the size of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound. And because of this it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three or four according to the size he needs for that purpose in every kind of fracture.
And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not double when pressed upon during the operation: and let its end be sharp, which has an edge at its ends. And let its upper part be in thickness from half of it to its lower part.
And this is its form. ›
It is necessary in this operation to place the sharp curved end of it on the protruding bone; and push it with one movement, until the bone returns and becomes even to some degree.
Try therefore to make the ends of the fracture equal to each other.
If the end of the fracture is thin and the instrument does not take it with a good grip, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
If you cannot return them with what we have described, then cut it with one of the incisions that we have mentioned, or saw it with a saw in whatever way possible for you.
Then scrape off what remains on the bone from roughness and small shavings.
Therefore, when the bone is reduced and the patient afterwards finds great pain that harms him, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do this. For you provide the patient with a great help, when your restoration of the bone is completed.  >
Then soak the cloth in black wine vinegar. And properly if it is summer. And do not place a cheese-cloth on the wound, nor anything containing oil: lest it cause putrefaction and corruption there.
Then administer astells at the end of your restoration of the bone. And leave the wound open: so that you make a cut with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
And take care not to bind the wound with the break. For often foolish physicians have done this: and caused either death or corruption or zochem, that is, pus, to happen to their patients. And let your binding be soft and gentle, different from the binding of other breaks.
If the wound is bad or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad outcomes that we have mentioned may happen to it, and you find lingering pain in the place: then it is not right for you to put astells on it. And make bandages of tough cloth in place of astells and bind the wound with them.
But after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from it the cloth which you placed on it with wine. Then administer liniments and ointments which we are accustomed to use for treating wounds; such as the four-ingredient ointment and similar ones.
And it is fitting that you should loosen the bandage. And consider the wound every morning and evening until it heals and is made whole.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus runs off easily.
But if many days have passed and the wound has not healed, nor has the pus been discharged from it; then you should know that there are small splinters of bone there. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe. However many of those splinters are separated out, remove them and extract them. And those that are not separated and prick the flesh, causing pain, try to cut them out and remove them in every way possible for you to do so.
But if the wound should become inflamed or have pustules, that is, suppuration, or another sign of corruption and putrefaction; then you must apply to each of them that which is appropriate for treating it, as has been described before in its own chapter.
And concerning what I have said and to which you should give your attention: when a bone is broken and protrudes from the flesh, such as the thighbone or hipbone, and similar large bones; it is that you should not attempt to reduce it, for many times death occurs from this; rather leave it alone until it becomes putrid.
For perhaps it may fall out on its own after twenty days or thirty.
Then, if it seems to you that the wound is healing, take care of it; but if not, leave it alone.
¶ On treating a swelling at the site of a fracture.
Multiple times this swelling occurs during the healing of a fracture. Especially when it is near a joint: and from this configuration the shape of the limb becomes ugly. And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply to it medicines that have an astringent effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, scammony, acacia, and similar substances.
Thus, take some or all of these substances and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar. And place them on the swelling on wool, and bind them well on the swelling itself. xspace
And leave the binding in place; do not remove it for many days. Then release it, and repeat another one, until the swelling is removed. xspace
Or bind a lead plate neatly over it. For lead has the property of removing anything feared from the limbs.
But if the swelling has already turned into a hard mass and requires immediate removal, then cut open its top part and cut away the prominent excess: or scrape it with some scrapers until it is removed; and care for it until it heals. xspace 
¶ On the treatment when a limb is restored but remains thin and not according to its natural shape.
When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, this occurs only for many reasons. One of these reasons is the frequent loosening and tightening of the ligaments not as it should be, or because of an excessively tight binding of the ligaments, which prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or because of an excessive amount of ointment applied at the wrong time; or because of a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and his weakness.  xspace
And its treatment is to feed the patient and make his body soft until the blood increases in him. And apply a bath. And introduce joy and happiness upon him.
Then place pitch on the member, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it. And continue its embrocation with warm water until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural shape.
§ On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly.
When a member already restored after its healing has a crookedness or prominence in the broken bone, or knotting, and the form of the member is disfigured by it, yet the member does not prevent its natural operation, then one should not accept the opinion of someone who thinks that the member should be broken again.
And indeed there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who did this in our land. ➤
And this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as if it were fatal.
But if the limping and knotting are recent, then it is necessary that an embrocation be made with warm water in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as althea leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar things. And a plaster should be made for him with softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Or the mucilage of the althea root should be shaken with chicken fat or sesame oil, and it should be plastered with it. ➤
Or take ripe figs and grind them with dove dung and similar substances that are called in the medicines as ones that decrease hardening.
And sometimes the knotting is dissolved with constant, old, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands. And let motion be applied to every limb in every hour.
But if the tortuosity has already taken hold and become strong, and turned into a hard mass requiring surgical intervention: then it is necessary to cut through it from above, and sever the bone's continuity with thin incisors; and ease should be applied to it with care and diligence.
On Speech Regarding Dislocation
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place. Therefore, it is prevented from moving and the figure of the limb is disfigured. And causes severe pain and injuries to afflict the patient.
Therefore, when someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to hasten for its restoration and not delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the site becomes swollen, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation as well.
Because of this, it should not be moved or extended during the hour of its swelling. Since often it causes cramp and painful injuries to occur.
However, when this occurs, then it is necessary for you to hasten to bleed the patient.  /> Nam sic fit, ut restauretur dislocatio in eo tempore, et non perducit in nephritidem. Then it should be left alone until the swelling subsides.
Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced with ease.
And every part of the limb should be scraped, as much as is remembered to return to its proper place.
I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation even as it was discussed previously in the section on fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.  /> Et secundum ordinem locorum, et secundum quod est necessarium.
¶ On the Care of Dislocated Lower Jaw
The two jaws are seldom dislocated except rarely.
And the dislocation of both occurs according to two methods. For either they are moved from their places by a slight removal and are softened briefly. Or they are dislocated by complete dislocation until they soften to the chest part, until the patient's saliva runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue rolls with speech.
However, when its dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself in many positions with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to administer its reduction quickly and not delay it at all: and it is as if the attendant holds the head of the patient, and the physician inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw between his teeth, if the dislocation is from one side.  Or he inserts both thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from two sides. And the remaining fingers of his hands are outside, with which he pushes evenly.
And instruct the patient to clean his jaws and open them fully as if to eat.  And the physician pushes the jaw evenly and presses it until it returns to its place.  
But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together; then administer fomentation with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Therefore, when they return and are leveled, and the patient's mouth is closed and does not soften; then place upon them small pieces of cloth, with a compress made from wax and rose oil.   
Then it should be tied with ease using soft ligatures.
And let the patient sleep on his back; and his head should be upright between two cushions, so that it does not move to the right or left; nor should he attempt, or be forced, to chew anything; rather, let his food be a gentle sipping until, when the pains are removed, and the jaw is fixed, then he may eat what he wishes, and it should be administered with ease.
He should not exert himself over the surgery of his mouth while eating and drinking and swallowing, until the jaw is fixed and healed.
But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their proper places, then fevers and continuous sweats often occur from this, and perhaps the patient’s stomach will loosen, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile.
Therefore, when you see this happening, know that it is a loss, and often the patient dies from it within ten days.
¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the upper arm.
Indeed, the collarbone is not dislocated from inside the side due to its connection with the chest. And it sometimes dislocates outwardly, and this is apparent to the senses.
Its restoration is done as follows: let the patient lie on his back, and stretch out his arms. › Then strongly press down on the place with your palm, for it will return by itself.
Then apply a plaster and cushions to it, and bind it tightly.
However, its ends which follow the elbow and are connected with it, do not become dislocated, except rarely. › › But if it is dislocated on some day, then it must be reduced and set according to what we have said and prepared for you.
Then place upon it a plaster, pills, and a bandage. And bid the patient to adhere to rest and quiet until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the end of the arm is reduced when it has also been separated from its place.
¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Know that the shoulder cannot be dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is that it may be dislocated towards the lower part of the axilla.  The second way is for it to be dislocated towards the chest. And perhaps it may be dislocated towards the upper part of the arm, which happens rarely.
And it cannot be dislocated towards the back, because of the glenoid cavity. And it cannot be dislocated towards the front, because of the nerves.
And most often it is indeed dislocated and exits towards the lower part of the axilla; especially in those whose flesh is scant. Because in them it exits quickly and returns quickly.  
But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, for it exits with difficulty and returns with difficulty. 
And perhaps in some people, a blow or a fall occurs and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, and it is thought on account of that, because it has already been dislocated.
Therefore, you should test that until you stand upon the certainty of it, and then proceed to its treatment.  
And a dislocation is known when it is towards the lower part of the axilla; and you should distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one. For you will find between them a manifest difference, and in the head of the shoulder there is a concavity, and under the axilla when touched it feels as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear nor move it in all its movements.
And likewise, if it is dislocated toward the chest or upward, then you will find a clear touch, and it will not be hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent or if the boy is weak.
And its reduction is that the assistant should raise his hand upward. Then place your thumbs under his nipple, and lift the joint with strength upward to its place: and the assistant should raise his hand and extend it upward. Then let him place it below, for it will return quickly.
But if it does not return through what has been said, and many days have passed since the dislocation first occurred, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water and be given an infusion that softens and soothes, such as boiling althea root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and administering it.
Then let the patient be laid on his back, and place under his nipple a ball of wool that is equally balanced between softness and tightness.
Then let the physician place his heel on the ball, and lift the head of the humerus with strength, and pull the patient's hand downward.  />  />  />  />
And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is that you should have present a man who is taller than the patient, and let him stand on the side, and insert his humerus under the patient's nipple; and lift the patient's nipple upward until the patient is suspended in the air.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  /> And another assistant should pull the patient's hand downward toward his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary to hang something with him so that he becomes heavier; for the dislocation will return immediately.
And it can also be reduced by another method: and that is to fix a long piece of wood into the ground, with a rounded head like the top of a mortar, not too thick, nor too thin. Then, after placing the patient on top of the head of the wood, soft cloths should be put under the patient along the length of the wood.
Then his hand should be extended downward on one side and his body should be pulled in the opposite direction with strength, for the dislocation returns to its place quickly.
If its reduction is difficult by all the means we have mentioned, then use this method: and that is to take a piece of wood whose length is equal to two arms, and whose width is equal to four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to two fingers; it should have a rounded head to facilitate its insertion deep into the ear canal, as shown in this figure.
Then soft cloths should be tied over the rounded head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Then it should be placed under the patient's ear, so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood until it reaches below; and the wood should be tied to an assistant, the arm, and the tip of the hand.
Then the arm should be placed on a step of a ladder according to its width, and the hand should be extended downward, and the rest of the body should be left hanging on the other side. For the dislocation returns immediately.
Therefore, when its passage is completed by whatever possible method, then it is necessary to place a woolen sphere of equal size under the ear. Then apply a plaster prepared from millstone powder and frankincense with egg white over the entire shoulder, as shown in the figure above.
Then tie a proper bandage under the ear and roll the bandage over the plaster as shown above; and fasten his hand to his own neck, and leave it there without moving his hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that the food of the sick person be scarce, until the limb is strengthened; because it is swifter for its healing.
Then let more [food] be given after seven days or five, and let it be consumed with movement. Therefore, if it becomes firm and does not soften, then it is already healed.
If, however, the joint is dislocated many times, either because of the moisture that affects it or for another reason, then it is necessary to apply a three-pronged cautery to it, as has been said previously in the chapter on cautery.
If all this is done and the ligament is released after seven days and the joint does not firm up, and the plaster and stricture are repeatedly applied to it but do not become firm, and fall off, and cannot be raised upwards; then know that the nerves which are at the head of the shoulder have already been cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never become fixed in its place.
But a dislocation which occurs towards the chest and breast or back is restored with pushing and extending by hand until it returns, and then the rest of the plaster and care are administered to it until it heals.
If, after healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness of movement, then let the sick person use baths many times until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original nature.
¶ On the Treatment of Elbow Dislocation
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; indeed it can be dislocated in all directions, especially anteriorly or posteriorly.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you; for it falls under sight and touch, in whatever form it may be dislocated. And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly shown to you. For the joint will be drawn together, and it cannot double the arm nor touch its own shoulder with it.
And you must hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess develops in it.
For if a hot abscess develops in it, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back. For it is worse than all other types of dislocations and causes more intense pain for them; and death often comes with it.
And the restoration of it when it is among those that can be reduced is to extend its hand with two hands: and let its arm be stretched out, and the doctor's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or if the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns by doubling its hand with his own hand, until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the root of his palm.
If the dislocation does not obey in its reduction, then administer a very strong and forceful extension; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should also hold him so that he cannot move during the extension.
Then the arm should be rolled to all parts after a double-length cloth or a wide bandage is wrapped around its hand.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that it is among those things that help in the smoothness of the joint with ease. Then he should push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns. 》
And after its reduction it is necessary to place a poultice on it, which contains astringency and drying with the white of an egg; and let it be bound with a proper bandage. And let the arm be hung from the neck of the sick person; and leave it for some days.
Then untie it. If then the joint is strengthened in its place, then untie the bandage from it and leave it alone.
And if you see that the joint is not well tightened, then repeat the plaster and the bandage, and leave it alone for some days until it is tightened. Then untie it.
But if heaviness happens to it after the reduction of the joint and the arrangement is in motion: then apply moistening with bathing, fine friction, and compression until it becomes lined, or place on the joint liliatum, that is, the fatty tail of a ram. Then let it be bound, and leave it on it day and night. Then remove it, and put him into a bath. When he sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction. Then repeat over it liliatum once, and a second time, and a third with entering the bath, until it is relieved.
And if you wish, place over it fresh cow dung, moistened and heated with butter, and bind it over it.
Do this several times. For it is soothed, and returns to its own state.
¶ On the treatment of dislocation according to Al-Zahrawi.
The small finger of the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
And its reduction is easy.  /> Unlike other joints.  />  \\ Nevertheless, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen; or a hot swelling occurs in it.
And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place a Mahassem on the infirm hand on a board, and let the assistant extend his hand; and let the doctor place his palm over the prominence of the joint, and press it until it returns.
However, it should be considered whether the palm has already receded to the abdomen of the hand; then let the patient place the back of his hand on the board for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be internally on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board so that the doctor's hand falls upon the very prominence of the joint.
Therefore, if it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster that draws out the swelling, and leave it, do not move it.
For if he does not tolerate it and you are unable to accomplish the reduction after some days have passed, although the joint remains according to its own twist, and nothing harms the patient except that his hand becomes soft and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves have been cut or damaged.
There is no skill in this, except to bind it with a hot iron near its injury. And perhaps that does not help at all.
Therefore, when the Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have described. Then let it be bound and left for five days; afterwards let it be unbound and left, and the hand should be exercised.
But if its motion is hindered and something heavy happens to it, then soften it with warm water and frequent rubbing until it is soothed.
About the treatment of dislocated fingers.
When one of the fingers is dislocated in any direction, or when a finger is dislocated to the back of the palm or its abdomen, then extend the finger and press on the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it straightens on that day.
When it is night, bind it according to the account itself; and do not cease unbinding it during the day; and exercise it with movement; and bind it at night.
Do this for several days until it tightens.
And do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; and bind it to that part, and perform your first procedure with it until it heals.
And do the same with it when it is dislocated in other parts.
¶ About the treatment of the dislocation of the back vertebrae.
When someone has a complete dislocation of the back or neck vertebrae, or many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death hastens to the sick person.
And the sign of this is that the sick person's excretion comes out involuntarily, and he cannot control it; and often some of his limbs are paralyzed from it, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is moved from its place.  />
For often they are moved, because often their removal happens in four parts.  />
That which is moved to the back is called humpbackedness.
But its cure is that you should consider then, if the humpbackedness happened from childhood; then there is no cure for it, and there is absolutely no healing from it.
But in that which happens by chance, or by a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken about methods of cure at length.  />  />  />  /> Whose benefit is least.
But I have already shortened it from that [version] whose inadequacy is excused by its closeness to me and my intention and exposition which I used and made the instrument in a different way than they showed and explained it.
Therefore, I say that in a hump which occurs from the front part, there is no cure or healing from it.
And similarly in one which forms on both sides.
And it is not cured by them, except the one which occurs in the back properly, as I will narrate: and it is to extend the sick person on his face on a level platform near the wall; and to spread moist straw under him so that his chest is not hurt.
Then a straight stick fixed in a hole in the ground should be placed at the end of the platform near his head; and another stick near his feet at the other end of the platform; and an assistant should hold the stick and it should not be firmly fixed in the hole. And another assistant should hold the other [stick].
Then roll [the bandage] over the head of the sick person and under his chin tie a soft but strong ligature; and extend the end of the ligature to the stick which is near his head, and tie it on that.
Then bind another ligature above his ankles, and above his knees, and near his groin. Then gather all the ligatures together and tie them on the other stick which is near his feet.
Then let each assistant pull on his portion of the ligature toward the stick and the two sticks should not be moved from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be firmly fixed, as we said.  />  Deinde extendat minister ut supra, et trahat infirmum per medium scapulas eius ad dorsum eius; et sic debebit curari.
And the physician should place his hands on the spondyl with strength until he returns; or he should place a board on it. Then he attaches his feet to the board until he returns.
If he does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits. And hollow out in the wall we spoke of, which is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board can enter. Then place the middle of the board on the pillow. And let the physician place his feet on the other end. And he should bind it well until it constricts the pillow and then return to his place. 》
Then if you wish, work with a lathe that is operated by hand; and it should be such that you fix in the ground near the head of the patient, at the end of the bed, two wooden stakes whose length is one cubit each: and also two wooden stakes at his head, at the end of the bed.
And let the distance between each stake be one handbreadth: and now a hole has been made in every place through which the lathe can run; and let all the wood be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
And insert a round wooden rod; and this is the lathe on which the bandage is wound between the two holes of the two stakes.
And at its end is a hole into which the wood, whose length is one handbreadth with what is wound around it, is fixed; and similarly on the two other stakes.
Then bind the bandages that you have bound on the patient's chest with the lathe at his head; and the bandages that you have bound on his legs with the lathe at his feet.
Then let there be an assistant standing by each lathe who turns his hand with the winding cord by which the lathe is wound; and the physician adjusts the pillow according to what we have said. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
This is the form of a lathe, which follows.
Then, after the return of the lathe and the place is leveled, it is necessary to put on a desiccating plaster with egg white. Then straw. Then place on top of the plaster a little plate of wood whose width is three fingers or about that. And its length should be such that it fits the swollen place and extends over the healthy part of the lathe.
Then let it be bound with the bandage mentioned earlier. And let the patient use a light diet until he is cured.
If any swelling remains in the place at the end of the treatment, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines for a long time together with the application of the board we have described. And now lead is applied on that plate.
And sometimes a swelling occurs in the last vertebra of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone which now protrudes. Therefore, one should not presume to treat it with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the shoulder never occur except as a dislocation, nor does what happens to other joints through slight separation and concavity happen to them. 
And indeed, the ankle joint can be dislocated in four parts. That is, because it can be dislocated forward and backward.   
And the ankle joint is most commonly dislocated inward, and rarely outward or backward.        
And the treatment for its inward dislocation is this: because when you join the healthy leg of the patient with his sick one, it is longer; and his knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and he cannot bend his foot at the groin; and there is a swelling in the place following the groin, because the head of the thigh bone has already arrived there.                        
And the sign that it has happened on the outside is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
And the sign that it has happened on the front is that it extends the healthy leg to its full length; however, it cannot double it without pain in the knee. And if it tries to walk, it cannot step over it to the front, and its urine is retained, and an inguinal swelling appears, and during walking there is a stepping on its heel.
And the sign that it has happened on the back is that it does not extend the knee nor can it double it before doubling the groin. And its leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and there is swelling at the place of the hip bone.
The reduction of these kinds of dislocations is, to consider then, if the dislocation is old and has already begun to heal in the patient. Then if you administer its reduction and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure for it at all. Therefore, it should not be presumed upon completely.
But in the one whose dislocation is recent and is from one of the four kinds of dislocations, then hurry to do this: roll the joint and extend it to the inside and outside, and move it to the right and left; perhaps it will return and not need any other care.
But if it does not return this way, then a strong helper should be prepared and extend his leg from the lower part; either with his hands or with a ligament that is tied over his leg above the knee. And another helper extends his hand over it, so that he inserts his hands under its armpits. Then bind it with a gentle ligature over the hip joint, and hold the end of another ligature.
And its extension should be from the front of the groin to the collarbone, or from behind to the spine.
And let their extension be all in one go, until the patient is lifted off the ground with his body, and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is a common type among four types.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then each type must be treated according to its own specific method of healing.
In the proper reduction of it when the dislocation is inward, one must make the patient lie on his sound side. Then place a ligature over the hip joint, between the head of the thigh and the place that is under the groin. 》 》 Then extend the ligature upward from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the collarbone.
Then another strong assistant should take hold of his arms, and reduce the thickened part of the dislocated hip with a violent extension outward. Now it has returned to its place.
And this method is the easiest of all the methods for reducing this limb. 》
But if the dislocation remains stubborn and does not submit to this method of treatment, then it is necessary that both feet of the patient be bound together with a strong ligature over both heels and both knees; and let each ligature have a length of four fingerbreadths from its companion; and let the infirm leg be extended by more than one and a half times the length.
Then let the patient be suspended over the head of a beam that is in the house; and let its length from the ground be two arm's lengths.
Then command a strong young man to support the head of the thigh; and let another young man be suspended with the patient; and let another young man push, supporting the thigh with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly. 》
In its own proper reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary for the patient to lie on a table, as we have narrated regarding the hunchbacked person. And let the ligament be tightened above his leg, properly, and above his chest.
Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one by his feet, and the other by his head. Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the table, fixed well, upon which moistened cloths may be wound, so that it does not harm the patient: and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Then let each assistant pull towards his side, and the physician shall equalize the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it submits to the return, it will be good.
And if not, place another table on top of it and press it evenly, as we have said regarding the hunchbacked condition. However, it is necessary for the patient to lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary for the leg of the patient to be extended quickly: and this is according to the same account on the table: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand over the groin of the patient.  /> Then let him compress it with the other hand, and with that compression place the leg extended downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is to the back, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downwards, but rather he should be raised off the ground; nay, it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is also necessary if his ankle is dislocated to the outside, according to what we have said regarding his lying on two ankles: and this is face down with the ligaments extended, as we have recently said.
And it is necessary that a compress be applied with a board also on the place from which the joint exits, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
And the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you; and it is that you stretch out the two legs of the patient: and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg and extends it without hesitation: then know that the limb has already returned as it should: then join the two thighs, and put on a poultice, and bind with a bandage, which is, a splint: thus, so that no joint moves to any part: and let the patient adhere to rest for three days, or four.
Then release the bandage and poultice, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now fixed: so dismiss the patient to walk.
And if you see any swelling: then return, and poultice it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Then release it and make the patient delay walking on both legs for some days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ On Dislocation of the Knee.
The knee can be dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated to the outer side, to the inner side, and to the lower side, that is, to the back.
And it does not dislocate to the front. ‌
And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply his leg to his thigh. ‌ ‌ If it does not stick with the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all ways of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can already extend his leg over it if he can, and press your back against his face; and put his foot between your feet.
Then press his knee with your palms, and stretch them between your fingers over his knee. Then apply both sides of his knee with your palm strongly. And another assistant should extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip gently, not forcefully.
Then bandage it, and make the leg adhere to the hip. Then bind them together with a band for three days, or four. Then unbind them.
And the patient should not walk for some days until he is healed.
If the reduction is refused by you, then apply strong traction with ligaments, as has been mentioned previously in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ On the treatment of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes moved by a slight displacement and sometimes dislocated completely. And its dislocation occurs either to the inner or outer side.  />
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding towards the side to which it has been displaced.  />  />
The treatment of its slight displacement is an easy reduction: and it is to stretch it gently with the hands and pull until it returns.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
In the treatment of it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright; and let a strong assistant hold him very firmly from behind his back, in its middle part.
Then hold with your right hand the upper part of his foot and with your left hand the lower part of his foot in the place of the heel.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. "Then with the left hand two times.
"Then extend with the left hand, and press the breast of the foot with the right hand towards the shin without difficulty.
"Do that twice, as we have said.
"Then press the breast of the foot towards the shin a third time, and you pull out the tendon.
"If then it returns in one time or two according to this manner, and you see the foot even, it is good. And if not, then repeat the operation on him, because he will return.
"But if you are prevented from bringing it back as we have said, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and drive a stake into the ground very firmly, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have already rolled a cloth over him, so that it does not hurt the patient.
"Then let the assistant take hold of his thigh; afterwards, let the other assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a bandage that he binds around the ankle. "Then let every assistant pull against the extension of his companion; and the stake shall stand between the two thighs of the patient, holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension.
"Then let the physician equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other assistant shall hold the healthy leg below. "For the dislocation returns quickly.
"When therefore the dislocation returns and its soundness is made clear to you, then place a poultice and wool, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the shin with a bandage.
"And you must be careful or fearful of the nerves which are above the heel at the back, lest there be a tight bandage over them and they injure them.
"Then leave him for two days, or three. If the sinew is softened, bind it; then release it on the third or fourth day, and prevent the patient from walking for forty days. But if he attempts to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not dissolve and be destroyed, so that afterward he may not receive healing.
But if he develops a hot abscess, then it is necessary that you administer to him the substance previously mentioned in our treatise on healing, and apply a poultice until it is removed.
On the Dislocation of the Toes and its Treatment
It is necessary to straighten what has been dislocated among them with a slight extension without difficulty; indeed this is not difficult but easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot's back, then it is necessary for the patient to sit with his foot on a level surface or on a board, and he should stand as if walking. ️
Then you should stand, and place your foot on the part that protrudes from those joints. Then step on it with your foot with strength until it returns and you see it has been straightened, and no protrusion appears in that place.
Then place under his foot a board that fits the entire foot, which has two handles. Then bind it with a decent bandage for three days. Then release it, and make him refrain from walking for many days until the joint is bound and securely healed.
On the Types of Dislocations with Wounds or Fractures
When something like this happens and you attempt to heal it and restore it, death often results; therefore, one should not undertake the healing of such a case unless he is skilled in the art with long experience, merciful, pious, cautious, not rash or presumptuous: and that he use at the beginning medicines which only suppress hot abscesses: and leave the patient to divine judgment. Unless you see or hope for health from destruction with gentleness of illness, and in which something of hope appears. Try, therefore, to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
If the member returns as we wish, then administer a treatment that settles the abscess, and care for the wound with one of the drying ointments suitable to it.
But if the dislocation is with fracture, and separate fragments occur in the bone, then try to remove them, and do what we have said about simple diseases from that which precedes in their places.
And be careful according to your strength, and keep yourself from entering the way of fear; just as my teaching has gone before you.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and safer for your body among those at your time.
