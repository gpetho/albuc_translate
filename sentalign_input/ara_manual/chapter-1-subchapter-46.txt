Chapter Forty-Six.
On Cauterizing a Callous.
If there occurs in some limb, due to a fall or a blow, a pain, and that pain persists for a long time and treatment with medicines does not work, then it should be cauterized with a point cautery. And the cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And the pain and the callus will be located by it. If it heals from the first cauterization, then fine. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on it, because it is the nature of these pains to move from the limb to what is near it, so it is necessary to follow it with the cautery until the patient recovers.
