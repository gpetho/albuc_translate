<p id="p001"><s id="s0001"> AFTER finishing for you, my sons, this book which is the part of knowledge dealing with medicine in its entirety; and having made it as clear and explicit as possible, I thought it well to complete it for you by adding this treatise which concerns surgical operating.</s> <s id="s0002">For the skilled practitioner of operative surgery is totally lacking in our land and time; so that the knowledge of it is on the point of being blotted out and its remains lost; and there is nothing left of it except a few traces in the books of the Ancients; where, however, it has been so corrupted by the hands of scribes, and subjected to error and confusion, that its meaning has become obscured and its value diminished.</s> <s id="s0003">Therefore I decided to revive this art by expounding, elucidating, and epitomizing it in this treatise; and to present the forms of the cauterizing irons and other operative instruments, since this is an adjunct to explanation and a vital necessity.</s> <s id="s0004">Now this is the reason why there is no skilful operator in our day: the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its exponent, before he exercises it, to be trained in anatomy as Galen has described it, so that he may be fully acquainted with the uses, forms, and temperament of the limbs; also how they are jointed, and how they may be separated; that he should understand fully also the bones, tendons, and muscles, their numbers and their attachments; and also the bloodvessels, both arteries and veins, with their relations.</s> <s id="s0005">And so Hippocrates said: 'Though many are doctors in name, few are in reality, particularly on the surgical side.'</s> <s id="s0006">We have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book.</s> <s id="s0007">For he who is not skilled in as much anatomy as we have mentioned is bound to fall into error that is destructive of life.</s> <s id="s0008">Thus I have seen many laying claim to this knowledge and boasting of it, but having neither knowledge nor experience.</s> <s id="s0009">I saw an ignorant doctor incise a scrofulous tumour in a woman's neck; and he cut certain arteries in the neck so that the woman bled until she fell dead before him.</s> <s id="s0010">And I saw another doctor presume to take out a stone from a man of advanced age.</s> <s id="s0011">The stone was large; he rushed blindly at the task and extracted the stone and with it a piece of the bladder itself; and the man was dead in about three days.</s> <s id="s0012">I had myself been previously called in to extract the stone but from what I saw of the size of it and the condition of the patient I judged that the outcome would be so.</s> <s id="s0013">I saw another doctor who had a regular salary from one of the high officers of our country for medical treatment.</s> <s id="s0014">There had occurred to a negro boy of his a fracture of the leg near the heel, together with a wound; the doctor rushed in, in his ignorance, and bound up the fracture, over the wound, very tightly, with pads and splints, not allowing the wound to breathe.</s> <s id="s0015">He then let him go as he wished and then dismissed him for some days bidding him not to loose the bandage.</s> <s id="s0016">Eventually his leg and foot swelled and he was close to death.</s> <s id="s0017">I was called in and made haste to loose the bandage, upon which some ease and reduction of the pain followed.</s> <s id="s0018">Nevertheless, gangrene had already taken hold on the limb and I could not hinder its progress; it.</s> <s id="s0019">continued to extend in the limb until he perished.</s> <s id="s0020">And I saw another doctor incise a malignant tumour; after some days the place broke out in open ulceration, thereby adding to the misery of the patient.</s> <s id="s0021">For a cancer that arises from a melancholic humour should never be touched by the knife unless it should happen to be in a part of the body which may be removed thoroughly and in its entirety.</s> <s id="s0022">Wherefore you must know, my sons, that operative surgery is divided into two parts, namely, where operation is associated with the health of the patient, and, on the other hand, where it is for the most part fraught with danger.</s> <s id="s0023">Throughout the following book I point out wherever I have described an operation that is accompanied by fear and danger.</s> <s id="s0024">It behoves you to be wary and to shun such, lest the ignorant have an opportunity to reproach and slander you.</s> <s id="s0025">Show, then, caution and care for yourselves and gentleness and perseverance for your patients.</s> <s id="s0026">Take the best road that leads to health and a happy outcome.</s> <s id="s0027">Illnesses that are very threatening or difficult to cure, leave alone.</s> <s id="s0028">Purify yourselves of anything which you fear may cause doubt as to your religious life and your secular life; for this will perpetuate your good name and will elevate your fortunes in this world and the next.</s> <s id="s0029">For Galen once said in certain of his admonitions: 'Do not treat mischievous maladies lest you get the name of mischievous doctors.'</s> <s id="s0030">I have divided this treatise into three books:</s> </p>
<p id="p002"><s id="s0031"> BOOK ONE.</s> <s id="s0032">Concerning the actual cautery; and cauterization by caustics.</s> <s id="s0033">It is divided into chapters set in order from the head to the feet.</s> <s id="s0034">The shapes of the instruments are shown and the iron cauteries and all things necessary for operating.</s> </p>
<p id="p003"><s id="s0035"> BOOK TWO.</s> <s id="s0036">Concerning incision and perforation; blood-letting and cupping; wounds and the extraction of arrows and the like.</s> <s id="s0037">The whole is divided into chapters in order; and illustrations of instruments are given.</s> </p>
<p id="p004"><s id="s0038"> BOOK THREE.</s> <s id="s0039">Concerning the setting of bones; dislocations; the treatment of sprains and the like.</s> <s id="s0040">This is similarly divided into chapters set in order from head to feet, with illustrations of instruments.</s> </p>

<p id="p005"><s id="s0041"> BOOK ONE</s> </p>
<p id="p006"><s id="s0042"> ON CAUTERIZATION</s> </p>
<p id="p007"><s id="s0043"> Before we expatiate on the actual operation of cautery it is necessary to mention its advantages and disadvantages and the temperament upon which it is to be used.</s> <s id="s0044">I say that a discourse on the advantage and disadvantage of cautery is a long one, a subtle learning, a hidden secret.</s> <s id="s0045">A great number of wise men have spoken on the subject with differing opinions.</s> <s id="s0046">Lest I should be over long I have reduced their opinions to a summary.</s> </p>
<p id="p008"><s id="s0047"> Now I say that the cautery has universal application for every ill constitution, whether organic or functional, with the exception of two: the functional hot temperament and the functional dry temperament.</s> <s id="s0048">About the organic dry temperament the Ancients differed, some saying that cautery helps in a constitution of this kind, while others said the opposite: that cautery is of no use in a disease caused by heat or dryness; for fire is naturally hot and dry and it is obviously absurd to treat a hot dry sickness with a hot dry remedy.</s> <s id="s0049">But he who holds the opposite view says that actual cautery may help in the case of such hot dry illnesses as arise in the human body; for when you compare the human body, humid as it is, with the nature of fire you find the human body cold.</s> <s id="s0050">I myself from much experience agree with this last opinion.</s> <s id="s0051">However, no one should attempt this operation unless he has had long training and practice in the use of the cautery, and is fully acquainted with the various human temperaments, and the character of the complaints in themselves; their causes, symptoms, and duration.</s> <s id="s0052">Concerning the rest of the temperaments there is no reason for fear, particularly the cold and humid distempers; all medical men are agreed and none differs concerning the utility of the cautery in such cases.</s> <s id="s0053">Now you should know, my sons, that the actual cautery and its superiority over cauterization with chemical caustics is one of the secrets of medicine.</s> <s id="s0054">For fire is a simple substance having no action except upon the actual part cauterized; nor does it do more than slightly harm any adjacent part.</s> <s id="s0055">But the effect of cauterization with caustic may spread to parts at a distance from that burnt; and also in the part cauterized it may give rise to a disease difficult to cure or even fatal.</s> <s id="s0056">Whereas fire, on the other hand, on account of the nobility of its nature and its superiority has no such effect unless it is overdone.</s> <s id="s0057">That has become clear to us by experience through length of service, devotion to the art, and acquaintance with the facts of the matter.</s> <s id="s0058">So I need not prolong this discourse.</s> <s id="s0059">Were it not inappropriate to this my book I should relate to you a deep secret concerning fire, the manner of its action on bodies and its expulsion of diseases; with a reasoned philosophical discourse too subtle for your understanding.</s> </p>
<p id="p009"><s id="s0060"> Know also, my sons, that the Ancients disagreed also as to the fit time for cautery, affirming that spring was the best.</s> <s id="s0061">Myself, I say that the cautery is suitable at all times; for whatever harm may arise from the season of the operation is utterly outdone by the benefit deriving from the cauterization itself; especially if the cautery is applied to pains that are severe, grievous, and swift, brooking no delay, because of the fear that the consequences may be more grave than the slight harm from the season.</s> </p>
<p id="p010"><s id="s0062"> Nor let enter your minds, my sons, the groundless notion of the laity and of ignorant doctors, that the complaint cured by the cautery never comes back later; do not cleave to this opinion.</s> <s id="s0063">The fact is not as they think; for the cautery is homologous to the drug which alters the constitution and dries up the humidities that give rise to disorders.</s> <s id="s0064">But the cautery excels the drug by the rapidity of its success, the strength of its action, and the potency of its powers.</s> <s id="s0065">It may be that the disease will return at some time according to the temperament of the patient, and the persistence and virulence of the disease; and from the formation of a mass of superfluities in the body; from his neglect of himself in acquiring them from food; and from causes of a similar nature.</s> <s id="s0066">Of course, if the disease to which the cautery is applied be a slight one, and in a part only slightly liable to superfluities and humidities, as, for example, the cauterization of a molar tooth for toothache, and the like, then it may happen that the pain does not return; but that happens rarely.</s> </p>
<p id="p011"><s id="s0067"> Another common saying is that the cautery is the final remedy; which is true, but not in the way which they mean.</s> <s id="s0068">For they believe that after cauterization no treatment, either with or without medicine, will help.</s> <s id="s0069">It means something precisely the opposite: after various treatments have been applied to a certain disorder without success, then last of all we apply cauterization and this proves effective; whence comes about the saying that the cautery is the final remedy—not in that sense in which it is popularly held by the laity and by many ignorant medical men.</s> </p>
<p id="p012"><s id="s0070"> The Ancients have stated that cauterization by gold is more effective than by iron.</s> <s id="s0071">Now they said that on account of the temperateness of gold and its noble character.</s> <s id="s0072">They also stated that the site of cauterization does not become purulent, but that is not absolutely so; for I myself have experience of that and have found that it happens in some cases and not in other cases.</s> <s id="s0073">Cauterization by gold is indeed better and more successful than with iron, as they have stated; except that when you are heating the gold cautery in the fire you are uncertain, by reason of the redness of the gold, when it reaches the desired temperature.</s> <s id="s0074">In addition to this it cools very quickly; and if you overheat it it melts in the fire, melts and runs, and the practitioner finds himself in difficulties.</s> <s id="s0075">Therefore in our own opinion cauterization is swifter and more successful with iron.</s> <s id="s0076">Now I have arranged this book on cauterization by chapters, set in order from the head to the foot, to make it easy for the seeker to find what he wants.</s> </p>
<div n="1" type="subchapter">
<p id="p013"><s id="s0077"> CHAPTER ONE.</s> <s id="s0078">On the single cauterization of the head.</s> </p>
<p id="p014"><s id="s0079"> This cauterization helps against excessive humidity and coldness on the brain, which cause headache, abundance of defluxions from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, excess of sleep, toothache, sore throat, and in general any sort of disorder arising from frigidity, such as palsy, fits, apoplexy, and diseases similar to these.</s> <s id="s0080">The manner of performing this operation is first to bid the patient open the bowels with an evacuant which will also clear his head, for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient.</s> <s id="s0081">Then tell him to have his head shaved; then seat him cross-legged before you, with his hands on his breast.</s> <s id="s0082">Then place the lower part of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes; and where your middle finger reaches mark that place with ink.</s> <s id="s0083">Then heat an olivary cautery.</s> <s id="s0084">Then bring it down upon the marked place with one downward stroke with gentle pressure, revolving the cautery; then quickly take your hand away while observing the place.</s> <s id="s0085">If you see that some bone is exposed, the size of the head of a skewer or a grain of vetch, then take your hand away; otherwise repeat with the same iron, or, if that has got cold, with another, till the amount of bone I have mentioned is exposed.</s> <s id="s0086">Then take a little salt dissolved in water; soak some cotton in it, apply to the place and leave for three days.</s> <s id="s0087">Then apply some cotton soaked in butter and leave it on till the eschar falls off; then dress with Tetrapharmacum ointment till healed.</s> <s id="s0088">The Ancients said that the more a wound is kept open, discharging pus, the better and more efficacious.</s> <s id="s0089">Some said the skin was to be cauterized through to the bone and the cautery held until some of the thickness of the bone was burnt.</s> <s id="s0090">Then the burnt bone was to be scraped out, then dressed.</s> <s id="s0091">Others said that the cautery should be carried through to burn a deep impression in the bone so that there should come out of the bone a piece shaped like a grain of a carob tree or a small spindle-whorl; they asserted that the vapours of the head would be exhaled through this place.</s> <s id="s0092">The wound should be kept open a long while, then dressed until healed.</s> <s id="s0093">But these two methods of cauterization I do not consider right except on certain men; and I regard them as risky.</s> <s id="s0094">In my opinion, to let the patient alone is preferable and safer, if it is to be.</s> <s id="s0095">For the head is weakened when its natural continuity is broken, as we see in other parts, and particularly when the patient's head is weak by nature.</s> <s id="s0096">In my opinion the first type of cauterization is safer and better; therefore use that and be safe.</s> </p>
</div>
<div n="2" type="subchapter">
<p id="p015"><s id="s0097"> CHAPTER TWO.</s> <s id="s0098">On cauterization of the head (continued).</s> </p>
<p id="p016"><s id="s0099"> When the whole head is affected by chronic headache which has for long vexed the patient, and electuaries, laxatives, errhines, oils, and plasters have been applied; and particularly if he has undergone the single cauterization which we have described, all with no effect, then look well, and if his head is naturally strong of structure and is not weak, and if he feels a vehement frigidity, cauterize him over again a little above the first cautery; then cauterize him on each frontal prominence with one cautery so as to remove the thickness of the skin and expose as much of the bone as we have mentioned above; and burn him with one stroke on the hinder part of the head in the place known as the occiput; but in this cauterization be gentle and do not lay bare the bone; for thus the patient would have intense pain, different from that of other head cauterizations.</s> <s id="s0100">I shall describe this cauterization in its own place.</s> <s id="s0101">The cautery for the frontal prominences and occiput must be more slender than that for the middle part.</s> </p>
</div>
<div n="3" type="subchapter">
<p id="p017"><s id="s0102"> CHAPTER THREE.</s> <s id="s0103">On the cauterization of non-chronic migraine.</s> </p>
<p id="p018"><s id="s0104"> When there occurs pain with headache in one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye; and the patient has cleared his head with purging drugs and there has been applied the other treatment that I have mentioned in the sections on diseases, but to no avail; in this disorder cauterization is of two sorts, either with caustic or with the actual cautery.</s> <s id="s0105">This is the manner of cauterization with caustic: take one clove of garlic; peel it and cut both ends off; then cut open the site of the pain in the temple with a broad scalpel till there is room to contain the clove under the skin; then introduce it under the skin till it lies completely hidden.</s> <s id="s0106">Then bind up the wound tightly over it with pads and leave for fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till it suppurates.</s> <s id="s0107">Then dress with ointment till it heals.</s> <s id="s0108">If you would rather, you may carry it out with one of the caustic drugs that I have included in the eighteenth treatise, on caustics.</s> </p>
<p id="p019"><s id="s0109"> The actual cauterization with iron should be done in this way: heat a cautery of this shape.</s> <s id="s0110">It is called the claviform; the head is nailshaped in that there is a slight curvature with a small protuberance in the middle.</s> <s id="s0111">Apply it then to the site of the pain, hold your hand steady and revolve it little by little.</s> <s id="s0112">Let the thickness of skin burnt be about half; then remove your hand so as not to burn a subjacent artery, for thus a haemorrhage arises.</s> <s id="s0113">Then soak some cotton wool in saline, apply to the place, and leave three days; then apply cotton wool with butter; then treat with ointment till it heals.</s> <s id="s0114">Or if you prefer you can cauterize this migraine with the knife-edge that juts out from the cautery; but be careful not to cut an artery, specially in this kind of migraine that is non-chronic.</s> </p>
</div>
<div n="4" type="subchapter">
<p id="p020"><s id="s0115"> CHAPTER FOUR.</s> <s id="s0116">On the cauterization of chronic migraine.</s> </p>
<p id="p021"><s id="s0117"> When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.</s> <s id="s0118">You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.</s> <s id="s0119">Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.</s> <s id="s0120">We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.</s> <s id="s0121">But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.</s> <s id="s0122">If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.</s> </p>
</div>
<div n="5" type="subchapter">
<p id="p022"><s id="s0123"> CHAPTER FIVE.</s> <s id="s0124">On cauterization of pain in the ears.</s> <s id="s0125">When the ear gets a pain from the cold and is treated with laxatives and other medicine as mentioned in its section and the pain nevertheless persists, heat the cautery termed 'punctate'.</s> <s id="s0126">Then after it has been heated prick with it in a circle right round the ear, or around both if there is pain in both, after the place has been marked with ink; the cauterizations being a little away from the ear.</s> <s id="s0127">Let the cauterization be of ten punctures or thereabouts round each.</s> <s id="s0128">Then dress the places till healed.</s> </p>

<p id="p024"><s id="s0131"> The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.</s> <s id="s0132">But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.</s> <s id="s0133">When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.</s> <s id="s0134">Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.</s> <s id="s0135">The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin.</s> <s id="s0136">The shape of the cautery.</s> <s id="s0137">It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see.</s> <s id="s0138">Its blade should have a certain thickness.</s> <s id="s0139">Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.</s> </p>

<p id="p099"><s id="s0456"> Certain learned doctors have mentioned a cauterization applicable to the hip in this manner: make a bowl of iron with a diameter of half a span; the thickness of the edge of its mouth should be that of a date-stone or a little less.</s> <s id="s0457">Another bowl is introduced into this, and a third into that; and there is a distance between the bowls of a thumb-joint.</s> <s id="s0458">The bowls are open on both sides; and the depth of them should be a thumb-joint or two.</s> <s id="s0459">Make an iron handle for them firmly fitted to the bowls.</s> <s id="s0460">Here is the figure.</s> <s id="s0461">Then heat this cautery in the fire until it is hot and sends out sparks; and so let it be applied to the hip, the patient lying on his sound side; and thus three circular cauterizations will be produced at a time.</s> <s id="s0462">Afterwards let it be for three days; then smear with butter and leave the wound open for a while; then treat with ointment till it heals.</s> <s id="s0463">The author of this book says that we very rarely employ this method of cauterization on account of the ugliness and dread appearance of it, and because we find few patients who will endure it.</s> <s id="s0464">Nevertheless, it is one of the best cauteries for him who can endure it and is correctly treated by it.</s> </p>

<p id="p144"><s id="s0726"> If it comes out with the tweezers, good.</s> <s id="s0727">But if not, try to extract it with a fine blunt hook slightly curved.</s> <s id="s0728">And if this does not bring it out, make a bronze tube and introduce the end of the tube well into the meatus of the ear and fill in round with wax softened with oil so that there may be no outlet save through the tube; then suck it out with all your breath; it will often come out with this.</s> <s id="s0729">But if it does not come out with these means we have described, take turpentine resin or bird-lime, a very little; twist some compact cotton wool on the end of a probe and put this on the tip; then introduce it gently into the ear after you have dried out all the moisture from the ear.</s> <s id="s0730">But if your treatment so far is unavailing, then be quick and incise before an abscess or spasm supervene.</s> <s id="s0731">Now this is the way to incise: first, the patient's cephalic vein should be cut and blood drawn, in proportion to his strength; then seat the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards; make a small incision at the lobule of the ear in the depression there (the incision should be crescent-shaped) until you reach the stone; then extract it with whatever instrument you may.</s> <s id="s0732">Immediately afterwards sew up the incision and dress it till healed.</s> </p>
<p id="p145"><s id="s0733"> If the object that falls into the ear is one of those grains that grow or swell, then try to extract it by the means already mentioned.</s> <s id="s0734">If it does not respond to your efforts to get it out, take a fine narrow scalpel like this and with it attempt to cut out whatever kind of grain has entered the ear.</s> <s id="s0735">You should not do this except when you are sure that this grain has become moist by reason of the vapours of the ear, so that you may cut up the grain into several small pieces.</s> <s id="s0736">Then you may extract them with a blunt hook or fine-headed tweezers, or by suction, as we have mentioned; for their extraction will be easy.</s> <s id="s0737">As for water getting into the ear, the patient should first employ sneezing excited by ptarmica, his ear having been plugged with a piece of teased-out cotton; he should lie upon that ear in which the water is; and if it so come out, well and good.</s> <s id="s0738">But if not, take a number of small stones about a finger's length, thin and smooth, and warm them a little in the fire; and have the patient put one of them into the meatus of the ear and let him hop on that one foot on that side; and, with another stone, tap upon the one put into the ear; he should keep this up with stone after stone till all the water has come out.</s> <s id="s0739">Sometimes the water is extracted by taking a reed or quill and introducing one end into the ear; then the other end is set alight till the greater part of it is burnt; then repeat time after time with more quills till all the water is got out.</s> <s id="s0740">Or else suck it out with a cannula as described for a stone.</s> </p>
<p id="p146"><s id="s0741"> As for the extraction of a creature getting into the ear, look to see if it is small of body, such as a flea or the like, in which case treat by those means mentioned in the section.</s> <s id="s0742">But if it has a large body, conspicuous to the touch, try to get it out with tweezers and hooks; for of all things that stick in the ear this is the easiest to extract.</s> <s id="s0743">As for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you have unavailingly treated it by those methods mentioned in the section in the treatise on instillations, you will need to examine the ear in the sunlight; and if you can see any worms, extract with tweezers or fine hooks.</s> <s id="s0744">But if you cannot see any, then take a cannula of this form narrow in its lower part, broad above; and introduce the narrow part into the ear as far as the patient can bear it; then make strong suction through it, repeatedly, till all the worms are extracted.</s> <s id="s0745">But if they do not come out in response to your treatment, plug all round the cannula with wax as bidden in treating for a stone.</s> <s id="s0746">If nothing will bring them out, employ the instillations which I mentioned as having been tried by the Ancients for killing worms; you will find that in the treatise on instillations.</s> </p>
<p id="p147"><s id="s0747"> The instillation of oils or drugs should be done with an instrument like this, as you will see; you make it of silver or bronze, narrow at its lower end, with a small perforation, and wide at its upper part.</s> <s id="s0748">If you wish, you may make the obturator which goes in the cannula of strong bronze; or, if you like, take a probe and wrap cotton wool tightly round its tip; then pour into the cannula oil, juices, or whatever of these remedies you want, with the cannula in the ear.</s> <s id="s0749">Then introduce the probe with cotton wool on it and press moderately until the oil is ejected into the meatus and the patient feels it enter.</s> <s id="s0750">Let that which you put into the ear first be slightly warmed at the fire; and be careful that it be neither very hot nor very cold, for the ear is not suited to bear that.</s> </p>

<p id="p158"><s id="s0803"> When superfluous lashes grow on the eyelid outside their natural place, below the natural lashes, and continue, they injure the eye and give rise to many kinds of disease, such as chronic lachrymation, dropping of the eyelids (ptosis), and whiteness and opacity, eventually resulting in the destruction of the eye.</s> <s id="s0804">The plastic operation on the eye is carried out in four ways: by the actual cautery; by caustic in the way mentioned above in the book on cauterization; by incision and suture; or with canes, as I shall describe.</s> </p>
<p id="p159"><s id="s0805"> You should place the patient's head in your lap, then with your left hand turn out the eyelid.</s> <s id="s0806">Now if it thus becomes everted, good; otherwise introduce a threaded needle beneath the eyelid and pass the needle up; let that be near the hair itself.</s> <s id="s0807">Then draw the thread up with the lid and invert the lid with a probe; then make an incision on the inside of the lid below the superfluous lashes with the lancet, from the greater to the lesser angle.</s> <s id="s0808">Then draw out the thread and put beneath the lid a small pad of cotton or linen; then mark with ink on the eyelid the shape of a myrtle leaf.</s> <s id="s0809">The shape should be according to the amount you wish to raise the lid, and varies in different people.</s> <s id="s0810">In some cases you should cut away a fair amount in proportion to the ptosis but in others a smaller incision is enough; all this in due proportion to the extent of the ptosis.</s> <s id="s0811">Then with a scalpel incise over the two lines you have marked, beginning at the greater angle and going toward the lesser angle; and let one incision be close to the natural lashes, at a distance of about the breadth of a probe.</s> <s id="s0812">Then introduce a hook into one angle of the skin and peel it all off; then join the edges with a needle and a fine woollen thread and wipe away the blood; and stick the ends of the threads to the eyebrow with adhesive, if you like; but if you do not it does not matter.</s> <s id="s0813">Then let the suture and the threads remain for about three or four days, then dress.</s> <s id="s0814">If you like, you may leave the wound without suture and treat it with drying medicaments and styptics; then the eyelid will be lifted as the wound heals and comes together; but suture is better.</s> <s id="s0815">The Ancients mention this method of operating.</s> <s id="s0816">It involves some burden for the patient; but the operation is good and safe.</s> <s id="s0817">Yet another way of operating is to mark on the eyelid the figure of a myrtle leaf as we have described; then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or joined thus.</s> <s id="s0818">Then cut away the superfluous lid with a small pair of scissors with an even incision.</s> <s id="s0819">The scissors are of this pattern.</s> <s id="s0820">But if you cannot conveniently hold with the hooks, take a threaded needle and introduce it into the middle of the marking; and put another thread through near the greater canthus, and a third thread near the lesser canthus.</s> <s id="s0821">With your fingers hold the threads evenly and then raise your hand evenly and you will raise up the whole of the marked skin as we have said.</s> <s id="s0822">Then bring the edges together with a suture and dress till healed.</s> <s id="s0823">But if in your incision, or the opening you have made, a swelling arises, then allay the swelling with wax and similar sedatives.</s> <s id="s0824">Sometimes the lower lid also has the lashes inverted.</s> <s id="s0825">For this you should use any of the methods we have mentioned: the incision and suture, and the operation by the actual cautery and by caustic. (</s> <s id="s0826">The operation by the actual cautery or caustic) is more effective, and easier on the patient, than incision and suture, (but incision and suture) is more workmanlike in either lid.</s> </p>
<p id="p160"><s id="s0827"> Trimming the lid by means of canes is done as follows: you invert the eyelid and cut the inner slit as I have described; then you prepare two slender canes or rods of a length equal to that of the eyelid and a breadth less than that of a scalpel; and at either end of each you make a notch to hold the threads.</s> <s id="s0828">Then gently put them together over the superfluous part of the eyelid and tie them firmly together at both ends and leave for a few days; for the ligated flesh will necrose and turn black and putrefy and eventually fall away spontaneously.</s> <s id="s0829">But if it is slow in sloughing, cut off with shears; then dress till healed.</s> <s id="s0830">And when it is healed the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye.</s> <s id="s0831">Now this is the figure of the canes; you should prepare them exactly in this shape and of this length and breadth.</s> </p>

<p id="p224"><s id="s1240"> The kinds of tumour are many and various, as will be mentioned in order in this book.</s> <s id="s1241">They differ in the way they are to be perforated or incised, according to two criteria.</s> <s id="s1242">One is the kind of tumour it is in itself and the humidities it contains.</s> <s id="s1243">The other is the part of the body where it occurs.</s> <s id="s1244">For the tumour occurring in the head is different from the tumour occurring on the posterior, and a tumour occurring in a fleshy part differs from one on the joints; each having its separate category of operation.</s> <s id="s1245">There are some tumours that should not be opened till after the pus in them is matured and ripe.</s> <s id="s1246">But others should be opened when still raw and immature, such as a tumour near the joints.</s> <s id="s1247">For when a tumour occurring near a joint lasts long enough to putrefy its surroundings, it often breaks down the ligaments or the tendons of the joint and causes paralysis in the limb.</s> <s id="s1248">Or if the tumour be near a major organ, if you delay the opening of it until it ripens you will damage that major organ.</s> <s id="s1249">In the same way, if it be near the anus you must open it, although unripe for opening.</s> <s id="s1250">The reason why you must open an abscess near the anus while still unripe, before it is brought to a head, is to prevent it from putrefying the cleft and penetrating to the inner part of the anus and becoming a fistula, and incurable.</s> </p>
<p id="p225"><s id="s1251"> It is necessary too to know the time to open fully mature swellings: it is when the pain of the swelling is lessened, the fever departs, the redness and the throbbing are reduced, and the head of the abscess becomes wrinkled, with other signs.</s> <s id="s1252">The perforation should be made in the lower part of the swelling if possible, so that the pus may more easily drain downwards; or else in the thinnest and most swollen part of the swelling.</s> <s id="s1253">Your incision should be longitudinal if the swellings are in such places as hands or feet or in the site of joints, tendons, nerves, or arteries; and, in short, in all flat places where there is no curvature.</s> <s id="s1254">In curved places let the perforation proceed according to the place.</s> <s id="s1255">But when the swelling is in the fleshy parts it is best to leave the perforation, as we have said, until it is fully matured.</s> <s id="s1256">For if you perforate it prematurely the sanious discharge will go on longer and will be excessively foul; and often both the edges and the depths of the opening will become indurated.</s> <s id="s1257">Some swellings are perforated latitudinally if necessary, or having regard to the requirement of the part.</s> <s id="s1258">In small swellings you should use a single perforation; while in large ones you should use wide or multiple perforations according to the size of the swelling.</s> <s id="s1259">There are also some swellings that need a circular incision of the skin, and should be cut when they have become like a rag, and necrosed —which actually happens often in abscesses and sinuses.</s> <s id="s1260">And there are some that should be incised triangularly; and others with an incision of myrtle-leaf form; e.g.</s> <s id="s1261">a tumour on the groin.</s> <s id="s1262">There are others again to which should be applied circular and lunate and similar incisions.</s> <s id="s1263">Those that have no head, such as the smooth and flat ones, should be incised with only a simple perforation.</s> <s id="s1264">When a swelling is large and has collected a large quantity of pus, and you perforate it, do not be in a hurry to get it all out at once; but get some of it out and then bandage it till another day; then again remove part of the pus; and so do, again and again, gradually, till it is all got out.</s> <s id="s1265">This particularly applies if the patient be in a weak state, or a pregnant woman, or a baby, or a decrepit old man; for the animal spirit is very often dissolved with the sudden evacuation of the pus, and the patient dies unexpectedly.</s> <s id="s1266">Be very careful therefore, with this sort.</s> <s id="s1267">Then, after you have opened the tumour, you should cleanse the wound and consider: if the tumour has only a small opening, or it is one simple incision, employ swabs of lint or cotton wool; but if it is a large tumour with multiple incisions, introduce a swab into each incision so that they meet.</s> <s id="s1268">And if the tumour was such that you cut away a part of the skin, or sliced the tumour, you will need to pack it with cotton wool or plucked linen, dry; and bandage until the third day.</s> <s id="s1269">Then remove it and treat with the needful ointments until healed.</s> <s id="s1270">If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, use cold water and vinegar, soaking a lint rag in both and frequently applying it to the place.</s> <s id="s1271">And if the bleeding still persists then it is necessary to employ the method and the treatment and the powders that we have prescribed in many parts of this book and in their own sections.</s> <s id="s1272">Now if this should be in winter and the site of the tumour abound in nerves, you should have some pads soaked in hot wine and oil and then apply to the place.</s> <s id="s1273">But if it be in summer and the parts be fleshy, apply the pads soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, all being cold, till the third day, as we have said.</s> <s id="s1274">Then unbandage the tumour and wipe it and give it the treatment suitable to it, until cured.</s> <s id="s1275">This is the information you need about the treatment of tumours in general.</s> <s id="s1276">As for the particulars, I now review the way to treat each tumour, by chapters, in detail.</s> </p>

<p id="p233"><s id="s1330"> The author of this book says, the interpretation of this account that we have given is this: when they see that one of the tumours that they mention has obstructed the patient's throat and he is approaching death and is anxious himself to be incised, they resort to laryngotomy so that the patient may breathe somewhat through the wound and his life be saved.</s> <s id="s1331">They bid leaving the wound open till the worst of the disease abates; its height will last about three days; then they bid sew up the wound and dress till healed.</s> <s id="s1332">My own experience was this: a slave-girl seized a knife and buried it in her throat and cut part of the trachea; and I was called to attend her.</s> <s id="s1333">I found her bellowing like a sacrifice that has had its throat cut.</s> <s id="s1334">So I laid the wound bare and found that only a little haemorrhage had come from it; and I assured myself that neither the jugular vein nor an artery had been cut, but air passed out through the wound.</s> <s id="s1335">So I hurriedly sutured the wound and dressed it until healed.</s> <s id="s1336">And no ill befell the maid except for a hoarseness in the voice, but nothing more; and after some days she was restored to the best of health.</s> <s id="s1337">Hence we may say that laryngotomy is not dangerous.</s> </p>

<p id="p276"><s id="s1560"> Circumcision is nothing but a solution of continuity like other wounds: but as it is a result of our deliberate action, and as it is done particularly to boys, we should plan in this case the very best operation, and the easiest way that leads to safety.</s> <s id="s1561">Now the Ancients made no mention of circumcision in any of their books, since it was not practised in their religion; but it is something we have acquired by experience.</s> <s id="s1562">I have myself seen the common run of practitioners and barbers carry it out with razor and with scissors; they use a spindle-whorl, a ligature of thread, and incision by means of the finger-nail.</s> <s id="s1563">I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature.</s> <s id="s1564">For circumcision carried out with the razor is often eluded by the skin; for the skin of the prepuce is of two layers; and often the outer skin is incised and the inner is left intact, so that a second incision is needed, and renewed pain; while when the circumcision is done with a spindle-whorl you are in danger of cutting the tip of the penis, since the tip often goes into the aperture of the whorl.</s> <s id="s1565">As for circumcision by the finger-nail, the nail will often slip off the skin and your operation be spoilt; or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short, for many are born thus, not needing circumcision.</s> <s id="s1566">I have seen this myself.</s> <s id="s1567">Experience has taught me the superiority of circumcision with the scissors and the thread ligature.</s> <s id="s1568">For scissors cut evenly, since the upper edge of the scissors is exactly the same as the lower edge; and so, as you compress your hand, thanks to the correspondence of the two blades you cut equally and simultaneously; and you make the girdle of the thread like a wall all round the skin of the tip of the penis: thus no error can occur.</s> </p>
<p id="p277"><s id="s1569"> The manner of operating is first to make the boy, especially if he is one who understands a little, imagine that all you are going to do is tie a ligature on the tip of the penis and leave it for another day.</s> <s id="s1570">Then amuse him and cheer him as much as you can, according to his intelligence; then stand him upright before you, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot and do not let the boy's eye chance upon that or any other instrument.</s> <s id="s1571">Then with your hand take hold of the tip of the penis, blow into the foreskin, and draw it back till the glans penis is exposed; then cleanse from it all unclean matter that has collected.</s> <s id="s1572">Then ligate the indicated place with a double ligature, and a second right round beneath; then take hold at the site of the lower ligature with thumb and forefinger, very firmly, and cut between the ligatures; then quickly push back the skin and draw out the glans penis; then let a little blood flow, for that is all the better and prevents the swelling of the tip of the penis; then wipe it with a piece of soft cloth, then sprinkle on it ashes of dried gourds (this is the best of all that I have tried) or else fine white flour, which is also good; then apply on top of the powders a piece of linen with egg-yolk cooked in rosewater, beaten up with fresh oil of roses of good quality.</s> <s id="s1573">Leave this on the wound until the following day; then dress it in the usual way till healed.</s> <s id="s1574">This is the type of scissors most suitable for circumcizing.</s> <s id="s1575">They should be fiat-nosed, sharp, with no bend in them, and with the pivot tempered ; and the length of the handles should be equal to that of the blades.</s> <s id="s1576">Now the mistake often occurring in circumcision is for the inner layer of skin, either the whole or the part, to be inverted at the cutting.</s> <s id="s1577">So you should at the start draw it out with your finger-nail before the place swell; then make an even incision.</s> <s id="s1578">And if you are unable to get a hold with your finger-nail then pick it up with a hook and make your incision.</s> <s id="s1579">If after three days there still remains some inflation and swelling of the part below the tip of the penis, let it be until the effusion subsides, and then gently peel it away and cut it as best you may.</s> <s id="s1580">Be careful of the tip of the penis; though if any of the tip is cut away that will do no harm.</s> <s id="s1581">And dress the wound with stimulating medicaments from among the powders that we described in the treatise on powders.</s> <s id="s1582">Should more of the skin be cut away than necessary and the skin is wrinkled up, that will do no great harm either.</s> <s id="s1583">Continue such treatment as we have mentioned, until healed.</s> </p>

<p id="p284"><s id="s1621"> Now I say that a vesical calculus most frequently occurs in boys.</s> <s id="s1622">Among the symptoms is that the urine passed out of the bladder is of a thin consistency like water, and sand appears in it; and the patient keeps on rubbing and playing with his penis; and often it hangs flaccid and then is erected; at the same time many of them get a prolapse of the rectum.</s> <s id="s1623">The cure of boys under the age of fourteen years is easy; but the treatment of old people is difficult; and that of young men midway between the two.</s> <s id="s1624">And the larger the stone the easier the cure; with a small stone the cure is otherwise.</s> <s id="s1625">When we undertake treatment the patient must first have an enema to empty his bowel completely; for sometimes the faeces prevent the calculus being found when it is looked for.</s> <s id="s1626">Then the patient should be taken by the feet and jarred to and fro and shaken downwards to bring the calculus down into the neck of the bladder; or else let him jump down from a height a number of times.</s> <s id="s1627">Then have him sit down upright before you with his hands beneath his thighs, to make the whole bladder incline downwards.</s> <s id="s1628">Then examine him and palpate him externally.</s> <s id="s1629">If you feel the stone in the empty place, immediately hasten and cut down upon it.</s> <s id="s1630">But if there is not the slightest sign of it to the touch then you should anoint with oil the forefinger of your left hand if it be a boy, or the middle finger if it be a fully grown young man, and introduce it into the anus and search around for the calculus, until, when it comes under the finger, you can work it slowly towards the neck of the bladder.</s> <s id="s1631">Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you wish to make your incision.</s> <s id="s1632">And bid an assistant squeeze the bladder with his hand; and bid another assistant raise the scrotum with his left hand and with the other hand stretch the skin under the testicles away from the place where the incision is going to be.</s> <s id="s1633">Then do you take a lancet like this and make your incision in the space between the anus and the testicles, not in the mid-line but on the side of the left buttock; and cut down upon the calculus itself, keeping your finger in the anus and pressing it outwards.</s> <s id="s1634">The incision should be oblique, wide externally and narrowing inwards down to dimensions allowing the exit of the stone, not larger.</s> <s id="s1635">Now you may press with the finger that is in the anus upon the stone as you make the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.</s> <s id="s1636">You should know that sometimes there are stones which have angles and edges, on which account their extraction is difficult.</s> <s id="s1637">Some are smooth like acorns and rounded, and these come out easily.</s> <s id="s1638">But in those cases where the stone is rough and angular you should slightly increase the incision.</s> <s id="s1639">Then if it still will not come out you must then resort to a device— namely to catch hold of it with strong forceps having an extremity like a rasp, to get a tight hold of it so it shall not slip out; or else introduce beneath it a narrow instrument with a crooked end.</s> <s id="s1640">And if you then cannot get the stone out, widen the incision slightly; and if there is any bleeding stanch it with vitriol.</s> <s id="s1641">If there should be a number of stones first push the largest of them into the neck of the bladder, then cut down upon it; then push a smaller one down after it; and do the same if there be more than two.</s> <s id="s1642">But if the stone be very large it is foolish to make a great incision down upon it; for the result is that the patient either dies or has a chronic urinary fistula because the place will not heal at all.</s> <s id="s1643">Try rather to manipulate it so that it protrudes;

<p id="p321"><s id="s1898"> When the foetus comes out by the vertex in the normal manner and yet the delivery is with great difficulty for the woman and you see that her strength is getting exhausted, then make her sit on a seat and have her held firmly, and foment her womb in a decoction of fenugreek and in bland oils.</s> <s id="s1899">Then the midwife should take between two fingers a little scalpel and make an incision in the foetal membrane or open it with the finger nail, to allow the contained waters to flow out; and put pressure upon the woman's abdomen until the foetus comes down.</s> <s id="s1900">But if it will not come down then the woman should have an enema of mucilage of fenugreek with oil of sesame.</s> <s id="s1901">Then bid her bear down after the enema, and with ptarmica stimulate her to sneeze; and close her mouth and nose for a while and the foetus will quickly come out.</s> <s id="s1902">If the hands of the foetus present, you should slowly and gently push them back; and if they will not go back then place the woman upon a seat, have her feet raised and meanwhile shake the seat; but the woman should be held lest the shaking cause her to fall off.</s> <s id="s1903">But if the two hands will not go back and the foetus is dead cut them off and draw out the remains.</s> <s id="s1904">Or tie tapes to the hands and pull on them evenly and it will come out.</s> <s id="s1905">Foot presentation: when the foetus presents feet first you should raise them both; then you should very gently turn the foetus so as to straighten it.</s> <s id="s1906">Then take one of its feet and stretch it gently.</s> <s id="s1907">When they come down as far as the hips, bid her bear down, make her sneeze with ptarmica, and it will come out.</s> <s id="s1908">But if it will not come out with these means we have described, you should return the foetus gently until you have placed it in the natural position; then it will come out easily.</s> <s id="s1909">But if it defies all that we have described, take mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and oil of sesame and dissolved gum, and pound them all well together in the mortar and anoint the woman's pudenda and lower abdomen; then make her sit down in warm water reaching to the costal margin.</s> <s id="s1910">And when you see the lower parts are softened, make a suppository of myrrh and let her introduce it; and when she has had the suppository in for a while make her sneeze, stopping her nose and mouth; and press gently upon the abdomen; then will the foetus immediately emerge.</s> </p>

<p id="p327"><s id="s1952"> If the lower belly be swollen or dropsical then you should make an opening to draw out all the fluid.</s> <s id="s1953">If the foetus present the feet then the extraction will be easy and it will be a simple matter to guide it to the maternal opening.</s> <s id="s1954">If it be stuck about the abdomen or thorax then pull on it with a cloth wound around your hand and cut an opening in the abdomen or thorax to allow the contents to flow out.</s> <s id="s1955">If all the limbs are removed but the head is turned backwards and is jammed, the midwife should introduce her left hand and, if the mouth of the womb is open, should put the hand into the cervix of the womb and investigate the head and, with her fingers, draw it down toward the opening and fix a hook or two in it, and extract it with these.</s> <s id="s1956">If it should be that the mouth of the womb is closed on account of an abscess, then one must not be rough with it but should use in this case instillations of moistening greasy substances; plasters also should be applied; and the woman should sit in a bath of softening and moistening waters.</s> </p>
<p id="p328"><s id="s1957"> If the foetus present laterally and it is possible to reposition it, there should be applied the things mentioned for a living child.</s> <s id="s1958">But if this be not possible then it should be cut away piecemeal and extracted.</s> <s id="s1959">It is necessary that not a scrap of the afterbirth be left behind in the womb.</s> <s id="s1960">When you have completed your treatment then also apply those treatments we have mentioned for abscesses occurring in the uterus.</s> <s id="s1961">If haemorrhage occurs, the woman should be put into styptic fluids and the usual treatment applied.</s> </p>

<p id="p342"><s id="s2017"> Fistulae in the lower parts are a knotting and thickening of the tissues occurring externally near the anus or in the perineum to one side.</s> <s id="s2018">A fistula may be single or multiple.</s> <s id="s2019">When a thickening of this kind has become chronic it opens and there flows out a white watery humidity or thin pus.</s> <s id="s2020">These fistulae may be perforating into the rectum or bowel, or non-perforating.</s> <s id="s2021">The former may be known by faeces or flatus coming out of them when the patient opens the bowel.</s> <s id="s2022">Often also worms come out of them.</s> <s id="s2023">Sometimes also there are fistulae occurring in the perineum which penetrate to the urinary bladder and to the urethra; and some also penetrate to the hip-joint and to the coccyx.</s> <s id="s2024">A fistula penetrating to the anus may also be distinguished from one not so penetrating by introducing the finger into the anus and a fine probe into the fistula, made of either bronze or iron, if there be no bend in the course of the fistula.</s> <s id="s2025">But if the course of the fistula be tortuous, then introduce a thin leaden probe or a horse-hair, until you feel the probe or horse-hair come on to your finger.</s> <s id="s2026">But if you do not feel it at all and if no faeces nor flatus nor worm come out of the opening, as we said, you may know it is not perforating; so hurry on with treatment.</s> <s id="s2027">When the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urinary passages it is signified by the passage of urine and by the fact that medical remedies cannot cure it.</s> <s id="s2028">But if it penetrate to the hip-joint or coccyx, this will be signified by the probe's passing right through to there if it be a straight passage to the bone; and by the pain felt in that part; and by the chronic purulent discharge; and the fact that medical treatment does no good and ointment does not heal it.</s> <s id="s2029">There is in these perforating sinuses no cure whatever; and their treatment is labour in vain for all the ignorant doctors who pretend that they understand them.</s> <s id="s2030">But there is hope in operative treatment for those that are not perforating and chronic, as I know from experience and shall now describe.</s> </p>
<p id="p343"><s id="s2031"> Thus: have the patient lying on his back before you and let both his legs be raised with the thighs flexed back upon his belly; then introduce a probe of bronze, or of lead if the course be tortuous, until you determine where the probe reaches.</s> <s id="s2032">Then, if the patient feel the probe somewhere in the region of the anus, put your forefinger into the anus.</s> <s id="s2033">If you feel the probe itself with your finger, coming through bare, and you do not feel anything interposing between your finger and the probe, either membrane or flesh, then you may know for certain that it is a perforating fistula; do not spend your energy over it, for, as we have said, there is no cure.</s> <s id="s2034">Yet some have said that it may be cured in certain cases, but rarely.</s> <s id="s2035">The treatment from which some relief may be hoped is to heat a fine cautery corresponding to the width of the fistula, as we have said before, and pass this, hot, through the fistula to the anus; then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those compact tags of superfluous flesh, which resemble quills, are burnt away.</s> <s id="s2036">Then dress with a pad soaked in oil until the burnt tissue comes away.</s> <s id="s2037">Then treat with healing ointments and, if it heals, well and good.</s> <s id="s2038">If not, it will never heal with any other treatment.</s> </p>
<p id="p344"><s id="s2039"> If you introduce the probe and it does not come through to your finger in the anus, and there be between your finger and the probe something firm interposing, either tissue or lining, and you see the fistula to be close under the skin, then cut open the skin at the origin of the fistula and continue your incision, with the probe in the fistula, until you come to the place where the tip of the probe has reached and the probe is freed and falls out.</s> <s id="s2040">Then clean out all the solid quill-like pieces of tissue and let none remain.</s> <s id="s2041">Then treat with healing salve until healed.</s> </p>
<p id="p345"><s id="s2042"> If the haemorrhage be too much for you and interferes with your operating when cutting away the tissues, then the best and most speedily efficacious thing you can do is to cauterize, either with fire or with caustics.</s> <s id="s2043">For cauterizing with fire unites two good characteristics, the burning away of those superfluous tissues, and the stanching of the bleeding, as well as the drying-up of humidity.</s> <s id="s2044">Then treat with a dressing soaked in butter, or sulphur pounded with oil, until the place putrefies and the burnt tissue comes away in the pus.</s> <s id="s2045">Then treat the wound with salves to encourage healing and the growth of firm flesh, these remedies having also a styptic and drying quality.</s> <s id="s2046">Then when the wound is healed over it is cured for good and there is no fear of a recurrence.</s> </p>
<p id="p346"><s id="s2047"> If the fistula reaches deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, then put your finger into the anus and palpate.</s> <s id="s2048">If you feel a barrier of flesh or membrane interposed between the probe and your finger, and it be nearly through, then there is nothing to be done except to try a remote hope.</s> <s id="s2049">There are three methods that you may employ.</s> <s id="s2050">The first is to cauterize it, as we have said.</s> <s id="s2051">Or you may cut it open until you reach the termination so as to be able to insert a dressing and bring the medicament into contact with it, but do not extend your incision too far lest you cut into the sphincter muscle and the patient become incontinent of faeces; then dress in the manner we have said and perhaps it may heal.</s> <s id="s2052">Or you may perforate the barrier and pierce it through, after incising to the vicinity of the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with some other sharp-pointed instrument; then clear away the fleshy granulations in the incision as far as you are able; then attempt the repair of the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening, until it heals.</s> <s id="s2053">Let the inner end of the fistula remain open, for this will ease the patient.</s> <s id="s2054">Sometimes also a fistula is cut out in this way: namely, you pass a probe into the fistula; it should be near the circle of the junction of the outer skin with the anal mucosa; then take a probe with an eyed point like a shoemaker's needle; put into it a thread twisted of about five threads, and insert into the fistula until it reaches the end.</s> <s id="s2055">If it has perforated through at the anal margin within, nearby, draw the thread out of that perforation by introducing your finger into the anus.</s> <s id="s2056">Draw out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together and leave for one or two days.</s> <s id="s2057">As the thread cuts into the tissues, tighten it up well until those tissues enclosed in the thread are cut through and fall away.</s> <s id="s2058">Then dress the wound until it be healed and sound.</s> <s id="s2059">If the mouth of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it as best you can, unless the depth is too great; in which case you must not do so lest you cut the muscle.</s> <s id="s2060">Then treat as we have said until it heals.</s> <s id="s2061">Figure of the sharp-pointed scalpel for cutting open fistulae; the curved edge should be exceedingly sharp and the other blunt, lest you cut what should not be cut, as you see.</s> </p>

<p id="p348"><s id="s2064"> Haemorrhoids are of two kinds: either internal, resembling red bubbles or grape-seeds, small or large, with blood perpetually flowing, and they may be single or multiple; or they may be external, round about the anus.</s> <s id="s2065">External ones are for the most part fairly dry; a little yellowish fluid or blood constantly oozes from them, and they are of the colour of the body.</s> </p>
<p id="p349"><s id="s2066"> The treatment of internal piles: bid the patient open his bowel and bear down until the anus opens out and the swellings are disclosed to you; then quickly take hold of them with hooks or with your finger-nail and cut them off near the roots.</s> <s id="s2067">If the hook does not retain its hold on them because of their humidity and softness, then cut them with a piece of rough material or a rag of goat-hair, or draw them out with your fingers and cut them off; and after excision sprinkle some caustic powder on to act instead of the cautery; or cauterize them as previously described in the book on cauterization; then dress in the usual way until healed.</s> <s id="s2068">But if the anus will not open out for you then give a slightly corrosive enema so as to wash out what is within, and then, the anus will open out quickly when the patient bears down.</s> </p>

<p id="p358"><s id="s2113"> I have already mentioned in the appropriate section the treatment of such wounds as are suitable for cauterization.</s> <s id="s2114">Here I shall describe the operative and medical treatment in full.</s> <s id="s2115">So I begin by saying that wounds differ according to that which causes them and according to the site.</s> <s id="s2116">Those things that cause wounds are many: a knock from a stone, a cut from a sword or a knife, a blow by a spear, stick, or arrow; and many such things.</s> <s id="s2117">To consider wounds according to their site on the body, they are such as a wound occurring in the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver, and so on.</s> </p>
<p id="p359"><s id="s2118"> Now I am going to describe the treatment of certain wounds, so that you may take them as a standard and a guide for other wounds.</s> <s id="s2119">I shall begin particularly with the simple wounds of the head; for mention of the compound wounds will be made at the beginning of the third book.</s> <s id="s2120">I say then, that when there occurs a simple wound of the head, with no accompanying bone-fracture, you should look; and if it be caused by a knock from a stone or the like, and has only broken the skin, but it is a big wound and you fear lest there occur an abscess, then bleed the cephalic vein at once without delay; draw off from him blood in proportion to his vigour if there is no contra-indication to venesection; and particularly if the haemorrhage from the wound be slight.</s> <s id="s2121">The venesection should be on the opposite side to the wound; and caution the patient against gluttony and wine and rich food.</s> <s id="s2122">But if from any cause venesection is prevented, he should be on a light diet and avoid meat and wines.</s> <s id="s2123">And apply to the wound, if there be any inflammation, cotton wool soaked in oil of roses, either alone or with a somewhat astringent wine.</s> <s id="s2124">And if you are sure there is no inflammatory swelling, then apply directly to the wound, if its blood is fresh and it is unaltered by the air, the powder that I shall describe to you a little later.</s> <s id="s2125">But if the air has already changed the wound, apply to it one of the ointments to cause it to discharge the pus; then dress until healed.</s> </p>
<p id="p360"><s id="s2126"> Now if it be a great wound, being caused by a sword-cut or the like, and dressings will not bring the edges of the wound together, you should suture them together in the manner I shall describe in dealing with the suture of abdominal wounds.</s> <s id="s2127">But if the skin has actually disclosed the bone, and is attached by a small strip only, then cut it away and dress the wound with medicaments that will produce firm flesh to replace the skin, and bid the patient go on a diet of solid food such as brawn and gruels and the like.</s> <s id="s2128">And if decomposition arise in the skin and it will not adhere to the bone, then excise all the diseased part and discard it and then dress.</s> </p>
<p id="p361"><s id="s2129"> If in these wounds there be an artery or vein shedding blood, and medicinal applications do not stanch it, then examine the artery, and if you find it not quite severed then cut it through with a scalpel and ligature it; and if you are compelled, our directions being unavailing, then cauterize until the haemorrhage stops.</s> <s id="s2130">If these be small and simple wounds their treatment will be a light and easy matter; it is sufficient to sprinkle some of this powder on while they are still bleeding, before the atmosphere causes a change.</s> <s id="s2131">Description of the powder: let one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood be taken, and three parts of quick or slaked lime, all beaten up together and passed through the sieve; and let the wound be packed with this and bound up tightly so that the powder sticks in position and coagulates with the blood.</s> <s id="s2132">Then bind pads above and let it be, not undoing it so long as it remains without swelling; for the dressing will not come away of itself until it is healed.</s> <s id="s2133">Lime alone can do this if you have no olibanum and dragon's blood at hand.</s> <s id="s2134">It has exactly the same effect too on most large wounds, when the application and bandaging are properly done, and when the haemorrhage is recent, so long as the air has not changed them.</s> <s id="s2135">If, however, the air has brought about some change, especially if it be in the summer season, then there is no point in the application of this powder.</s> <s id="s2136">Treat it then as we have said, by applying one or other of the suppurative ointments; or by applying a gruel of barleymeal with water and honey, so that the pus flows; then treat by all the usual methods until cured.</s> <s id="s2137">If, with the wound, there be also fracture of a bone, if it be slight, you should extract it with forceps.</s> <s id="s2138">I mention the treatment of fractures of the head later on.</s> </p>
<p id="p362"><s id="s2139"> On wounds in the neck:</s> </p>
<p id="p363"><s id="s2140"> If a wound occur in the neck the treatment of it does not differ from that of a head wound, if it be simple.</s> <s id="s2141">But if a nerve or artery in the neck happens to be cut: if it be a nerve, there is no device that will serve except to avoid treatment of it by strong styptic remedies such as verdigris and vitriol and the like; for these injure the nerve and cause spasm; and under no circumstance let anything cold be applied to the wound, for the substance of the nerve is cold and it is continuous with the brain, which is the most noble among the organs.</s> <s id="s2142">But let your remedy for it be mild, such as lime slaked in sweet water many times and moistened with olive-oil or oil of roses; and with tutty, likewise washed in sweet water; and other minerals according to this prescription, and with bland ointments.</s> <s id="s2143">If the wound be large, use stitches or draw the edges of the wound together with pads; then dress until cured.</s> <s id="s2144">But if there be depth to the wound and a sinus appears at the bottom of it, in which pus has collected, then make an opening at the site of greatest depth.</s> <s id="s2145">Now if an artery has been cut in the wound and you are in time to find it still bleeding, divide it or ligature it; or cauterize it if you are compelled to.</s> <s id="s2146">If it be such a wound that some of the cartilages of the trachea are laid open, or the whole trachea, the jugular veins being safe and sound, then join the skin edges together with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, but straighten it and restore to its natural form; then tie firmly and leave for some days; then treat with salves having some styptic and astringent quality, until healed.</s> <s id="s2147">If the wound has affected bone, examine it, and if there be fragments of bone in it get them all out, or all you can.</s> <s id="s2148">Those you cannot get hold of, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, and it will be easy to extract them.</s> <s id="s2149">If it be a fresh wound, sprinkle on the powder I have described ; and if any bone corrupt in the wound and it becomes a fistula, treat it by those means we shall mention in their place.</s> </p>
<p id="p364"><s id="s2150"> On wounds in the chest and between the shoulders:</s> </p>
<p id="p365"><s id="s2151"> If it be a piercing wound by a spear or a knife, and you see that it is deep, examine if there be a passage of air out of it when the patient breathes; whence you may know that the injury is mortal.</s> <s id="s2152">But if it is not deep and the haemorrhage is fresh, then do not straight away apply powder or bandage lest it keep the blood in the depths, so that it be returned to the heart and kill the patient; but apply to it a drawing ointment, and uncover it twice daily.</s> <s id="s2153">If you have no ointment, apply carded cotton to the opening of the wound to soak up the humidities issuing from it.</s> <s id="s2154">And make the patient sleep on the (side of the) wound so that what collects therein may flow out.</s> <s id="s2155">And if three or four days pass by after the wound, and the patient have no spasm or harmful palpitation of the heart nor obstruction to drawing breath, and you see that in other respects he is doing well, you may know that the wound is not dangerous; so treat it with pads and the usual dressings until it heals.</s> <s id="s2156">But if it will not heal and it permanently discharges pus, you may know that it has become a fistula; look for the treatment of this in the proper place.</s> <s id="s2157">If the wound be from a cut with a sword or knife, a straightforward surface wound in the breast or back, then treat it as described before; that is, by suture if it be a great wound or by powder if it be a small one.</s> <s id="s2158">But if there has also been injury to the bone, cutting out fragments from it, you should explore the wound and hasten to draw out the fragments if they are detached from the bone; but if they are not detached then let be until the wound suppurates, when the removal of the fragments will be easy.</s> <s id="s2159">Then with regard to other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, the same class of treatment should be used for them as for those already mentioned.</s> </p>

<p id="p367"><s id="s2167"> Then you should know that suturing the abdomen may be carried out in four ways.</s> <s id="s2168">Two of them are general; suitable both for suture of the abdomen and for other wounds of the body.</s> <s id="s2169">The other two sutures are special; they may be used for other wounds, but are more suitable for abdominal wounds.</s> <s id="s2170">I shall describe each one to you separately, with comments and explanation.</s> <s id="s2171">I begin then by saying that when the wound is small, and a piece of intestine protrudes from it, rendering the reduction of it difficult, the difficulty will be due to one of two causes: either on account of the smallness of the fissure, as we said; or because the gut has become inflated on account of the coldness of the air.</s> <s id="s2172">If the latter case obtains, the gut must be warmed by fomenting with a sponge or piece of cloth bathed with warm water or water in which have been boiled rushes and cyperus and hyacinth, bathing the gut until the inflation is gone down.</s> <s id="s2173">Wine that is somewhat astringent may do; in bringing down the swelling it is better than plain water.</s> <s id="s2174">When you see that the swelling has come down, bathe the gut with water in which have been infused althea and mallows; for with this the reduction of the bowel becomes easy, using the lightest effort.</s> <s id="s2175">But if after this treatment the reduction is still difficult, open up the wound a little with the instrument for opening up haemorrhoids.</s> <s id="s2176">The first method, if possible, is better than incision, but one may be compelled to incise when other means have failed.</s> <s id="s2177">This is the form of the instrument.</s> <s id="s2178">The curved side should be sharpened, but not the other; the slender extremity should not be as slender as a scalpel, but rather blunt; it is an instrument like a small polo-stick, as you see.</s> <s id="s2179">When the wound is opened up a little with the instrument and the bowel is reduced, it is important to return it to its natural shape and proper position, if you can, for that is better.</s> <s id="s2180">When the wound is large and in the lower abdomen the patient should lie on his back and have his legs higher than his head; but if it be in the upper abdomen his head and chest should be placed higher than his lower parts.</s> <s id="s2181">And in the same way if the opening be on one side of the abdomen you should always make it your object to put the wounded side higher than the other.</s> <s id="s2182">So must you proceed in large or middling wounds.</s> <s id="s2183">But in small wounds put the patient in a position convenient to yourself.</s> <s id="s2184">Then have an assistant under your direction to enclose within his hands the whole of the wound and bring the edges together, and then uncover it bit by bit for the one who is putting in the stitches.</s> </p>
<p id="p368"><s id="s2185"> Now this is the description of one general suture, namely: one or more needles are taken, depending on the size of the wound; then, leaving about the width of the little finger from the end of the opening, pass an unthreaded needle from within through both edges of the skin together with both edges of the peritoneum which lies beneath the skin, piercing from one side to the other; thus you will have brought together both skin edges and both peritoneal edges, making four layers.</s> <s id="s2186">Then wind a double thread several times round the needle, and tighten up from both sides so as to bring the two edges of the wound perfectly together.</s> <s id="s2187">Then again leave about a finger's breadth and put in another needle and fasten it with thread as you did in the first instance; and go on doing this with as many needles as you need until you have finished mending the whole wound.</s> <s id="s2188">The needles should be of medium fineness; for the very fine needles soon cut into the flesh; while thick needles, on the other hand, are difficult to pass through the skin; so they should be medium between fineness and thickness.</s> <s id="s2189">You should not introduce the needle too near the edge of the skin lest the tissues be soon cut through and the wound gape before it has joined.</s> <s id="s2190">Nor should there be too great an interval between the stitches, lest the wound be prevented from scarring up.</s> <s id="s2191">Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they hurt the patient during sleep; and make for him pads of linen scraps to cover the needle ends on both sides; and let them be until you know the wound is healed up.</s> <s id="s2192">This method of suture with needles is most suitable in small wounds, for one or two needles or thereabouts will probably be enough for such.</s> <s id="s2193">Now the second kind of general suture is to bring together all four edges, the two skin edges and the two peritoneal edges, at one and the same time, with a needle furnished with a twisted thread of medium thickness.</s> <s id="s2194">Then when the needle has pierced these four edges bring it back precisely to where you began, so that the thread may lie knitted over the wound to make a stitch in the manner of sewing up the bags in which goods are packed.</s> <s id="s2195">The distance between stitches should be a little finger's breadth.</s> <s id="s2196">Everybody is familiar with this stitch.</s> <s id="s2197">With this stitch I once sewed up a wound that a man got in the belly.</s> <s id="s2198">He had been wounded with a knife; and the opening of the wound was more than a span long; and by that time there protruded some two spans' length of his mid-gut.</s> <s id="s2199">The opening was in the middle of his belly; and I reduced it after the bowel had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.</s> <s id="s2200">The wound healed in about a fortnight, and I treated him until he was better; and he lived for many years after this, carrying on as usual.</s> <s id="s2201">The verdict of the doctors was that he could not be healed.</s> <s id="s2202">The remarkable thing is that I did not treat him with any ointment, for I was in a place where there was no sort of medicine; so twice a day I applied teased-out cotton wool to the wound, and carefully washed it with honey-water until he was healed.</s> </p>
<p id="p369"><s id="s2203"> I shall now describe one of the two kinds of special suture according to the text of Galen.</s> <s id="s2204">You begin at the skin, running the needle from without inwards.</s> <s id="s2205">When you pass it through the skin and the muscle that runs the length of the belly, leave the edge of the peritoneum on that side where the needle was introduced; and pierce the other edge of the peritoneum from within outwards through the other edge of the abdominal wall.</s> <s id="s2206">When you have done this, pierce the same edge of the abdominal wall from the outside inwards, leaving the edge of the peritoneum which is on that side, and pierce the other side from within outwards.</s> <s id="s2207">As you pierce, make the needle pass through the peritoneum to the edge of the abdominal wall that is adjacent to that part until it pierces right through the whole.</s> <s id="s2208">Then begin again on that same side and sew it together with the peritoneal edge on the opposite side and bring the needle out through the skin nearby.</s> <s id="s2209">Then reintroduce into the same skin area and sew the opposite peritoneal edge with that abdominal skin edge and bring the needle out through the adjacent skin.</s> <s id="s2210">Do this once again and repeat until you have sewn up the whole wound after this fashion.</s> <s id="s2211">In short, this way of suturing is to sew with the stitch used by furriers in sewing skins; thus you stitch the peritoneum once one way with the skin edge and leave it once the other way, until you have done.</s> </p>
<p id="p370"><s id="s2212"> Now the manner of the second type of special stitch which Galen mentioned is this (these are his own words): that you suture it in the same way as many practitioners.</s> <s id="s2213">That is, they suture each part to the part that corresponds naturally to it; so they join one peritoneal margin to the other and one skin margin to the other, in the manner I shall describe.</s> <s id="s2214">You should put the needle from without inwards, in that edge of the abdominal wall that is nearest to you, and make it pass inward through that alone, leaving out the peritoneal edges; then turn the needle round and run it from without inwards through both peritoneal edges.</s> <s id="s2215">Then turn it round again and make it pierce, from within outwards, the other edge of the abdominal wall, on the opposite side.</s> <s id="s2216">This type of suture is better than the easy general suture that has been mentioned.</s> <s id="s2217">These are Galen's very words.</s> <s id="s2218">Some have said that the suture of the abdomen may be performed with two needles, thus: you thread one thread into both and begin by introducing the needle into that part near you and carrying it through to the other side.</s> <s id="s2219">Then you insert the other needle on the far side and bring it through to the near side, after the manner of the shoemaker's stitch.</s> </p>
<p id="p371"><s id="s2220"> You must understand that when the fissure is in the middle of the abdomen the sewing of it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.</s> <s id="s2221">But the medical treatment of the wound comes under just the same heading as that of other wounds.</s> <s id="s2222">When you find a wound with its blood quite fresh, before the atmosphere has altered it, and you have reduced the intestine and have sewn it up and closed it firmly, apply to it powder to encourage fresh growth.</s> <s id="s2223">But if the air has altered it, then apply to it some of the available ointments until it suppurates and the threads come away and the peritoneum and abdominal wall heal; then dress it as you would any other wound, until it is better.</s> <s id="s2224">If you have no medicaments to hand, apply cotton wool as soon as suppuration begins, and change it twice daily, as I have taught you, until it heals.</s> <s id="s2225">You will need no other treatment in the majority of cases when the wounds are simple.</s> </p>
<p id="p372"><s id="s2226"> But if you fear that the important organs may share the hurt of the wound, then you should dip some soft wool in moderately warm olive-oil or oil of roses and bind it round the various sites between the groin and the axillae.</s> <s id="s2227">If pain or gangrene be felt in the bowels—and that frequently happens—then clyster him with tepid astringent black wine, particularly if the gangrene has already set in in the bowel and has become a wound penetrating to the abdominal cavity.</s> <s id="s2228">You should know that if the injured bowel be the large intestine it will heal the more easily, while if it be the small its healing is more difficult.</s> <s id="s2229">But the part of the bowel called the jejunum is not likely to recover from an injury to it at all; and that is due to the number and size of arteries in it and to the thinness of its structure and to its nearly approaching a nerve in its character.</s> <s id="s2230">If what protrudes from the wound be omentum, and you find it freshly protruding, then reduce it as you do intestine.</s> <s id="s2231">But if some time has lapsed and it has turned green or black, you should ligate it above the site where it has gone black lest there be a haemorrhage; for the omentum contains veins and arteries.</s> <s id="s2232">Then cut off what is below the ligature and leave the ends of the thread hanging out from the lower part of the wound, so that it will be easy for you to draw upon it and extract it as the omentum falls away and the wound suppurates.</s> </p>
<p id="p373"><s id="s2233"> A note on the wound occurring in the intestine.</s> <s id="s2234">When a break occurs in the intestine and it is a small one, it is possible, in some men, that it may mend.</s> <s id="s2235">For I myself saw a man who had been wounded by a spear-thrust in the abdomen.</s> <s id="s2236">The wound was to the right of the stomach, and, being chronic, became a fistula whence issued faeces and flatus.</s> <s id="s2237">I set about treating him, though I had no hope of his recovery, and I continued to attend him, and eventually he recovered and the place healed over.</s> <s id="s2238">And when I saw that the place had healed over I was afraid for the patient lest some harm should occur in the abdominal cavity; but absolutely no harm arose from it, and he remained perfectly well and healthy, eating and drinking and engaging in coitus and going to the bath and carrying out the duties of his office.</s> <s id="s2239">Some men of experience have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, it should be sutured in this manner, namely: ants with large heads are taken; then the edges of the wound are brought together and one of these ants is applied by its open jaws to the two edges of the wound, and when it seizes it and closes its jaws then the head is cut off, and it will stick and will not loosen.</s> <s id="s2240">Then another ant is applied near the first; and you proceed after this manner with a number of ants according to the size of the wound.</s> <s id="s2241">Then reduce the intestine and sew up the wound; for the heads will remain sticking to the intestine until it is healed up; and no harm will come to the patient.</s> </p>
<p id="p374"><s id="s2242"> The intestine may also be sewn up with the fine suture which is extracted from an animal's gut and sticks to it after being threaded in a needle.</s> <s id="s2243">The method is that the end is taken of this suture made of gut, well scraped; and to this end is fixed a fine linen thread, twisted, and then that thread is passed through the needle affixed to the suture of animal's gut, with which the intestine is sewn and then replaced in the abdominal cavity.</s> <s id="s2244">These kinds of suture, with the ants and with the gut, are by way of a remote hope.</s> <s id="s2245">But if the opening be great and wide, and especially if it be in one of the small intestines, there is no technique to deal with it, nor any cure.</s> </p>

<p id="p375"><s id="s2246"> CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX.</s> <s id="s2247">On the treatment of defluxions and fistulae.</s> </p>
<p id="p376"><s id="s2248"> You should know that any wound or tumour, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal over, but discharges pus chronically and constantly, is generally called a fistula, in whatever part of the body it may be; but we call it a defluxion.</s> <s id="s2249">The fistula proper is a compact hard white painless induration with a central hollow like a bird's quill; on which account some call it a quill.</s> <s id="s2250">At certain times it may be moist, constantly discharging pus; and again at certain times the moisture may cease; and the discharge may be greater or less; and it may be thick or thin.</s> <s id="s2251">I said previously in the appropriate section, when I was discussing abscesses, that any ulcer that would not heal nor show growth of tissue was due to one of nine causes.</s> <s id="s2252">One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the locality—as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it.</s> <s id="s2253">I have indeed already, in their proper place, explained all these causes and their symptoms and their medical treatments.</s> <s id="s2254">Now here I must explain to you the operative treatment of fistula and defluxion.</s> </p>
<p id="p377"><s id="s2255"> You should know that a fistula may happen in any part of the body; and some fistulae reach as far as some great vein or artery or nerve or membrane or intestine or the urinary bladder, or one of the ribs or dorsal vertebrae, or some highly complex joint such as the hand or foot, while some terminate quite near some major organ, and so on.</s> <s id="s2256">Fistulae of this kind are among the diseases from which recovery is difficult; they are not amenable to treatment and to occupy oneself with them is labour in vain.</s> <s id="s2257">But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that.</s> <s id="s2258">But if the fistula be tortuous then investigate it with a thin leaden probe; for lead is soft, so as to flex on entry and follow the curves of the fistula.</s> <s id="s2259">But if the fistula have multiple openings so that you cannot explore it with the probe, then make an injection into one of the openings.</s> <s id="s2260">The fluid you inject into that one will run to the other openings and flow out from them.</s> <s id="s2261">Then make a complete exploration by whatever means you can, to find out whether there be at that place a bone or nerve, and whether the fistula be deep or superficial, and whether the fistula be one with multiple openings.</s> <s id="s2262">Inform yourself of all these points, exerting yourself to inquire of the patient whether he feels pain while you are compressing with the hand, and seeking other indications and causes of tumour that may arise.</s> <s id="s2263">When you have made quite certain of all these points, then proceed confidently with the treatment, namely: see if the fístula be obvious and accessible, or in a harmless situation far removed from a joint or vein or artery or tendon or any of the other places I have mentioned to you.</s> <s id="s2264">Then lay open the fístula by the method I have described and fetch out of it all the granulations and diseased and superfluous tissue and whatever tissue or growth be arising in its opening, and dress until healed.</s> <s id="s2265">If the termination of the fistula lies deep and its course be straight, you should cut it open as far in as you can and then clean out of it all diseased tissue; then use swabs soaked in corrosive, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, which is as far as you can reach with the probe.</s> <s id="s2266">Do this repeatedly until the caustic has destroyed all the superfluous matter remaining at the bottom of the fistula.</s> <s id="s2267">Then dress it with ointments that make the flesh grow sound, until it heals.</s> <s id="s2268">But if it does not heal thus, then cauterize it in the prescribed way.</s> </p>
<p id="p378"><s id="s2269"> If a bone be the cause of the fistula, and you are sure of that, then examine the fistula and open it up in the way I have told you, if there be nothing in the way like a blood-vessel or nerve or important organ, as we said.</s> <s id="s2270">And if the bone is laid bare to you and there be in it some corruption and blackening, then scrape it until all the corruption be removed; then put on dressings that will encourage granulation, until it be healed.</s> <s id="s2271">If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely.</s> <s id="s2272">Therefore you must expose it again and with the utmost diligence carry out the scraping and cleaning of it.</s> <s id="s2273">Then dress it; and if it heals, good; if not, then you may know that this corruption is very deep-seated in the body and out of reach, and there is nothing you can do for it but leave it to nature.</s> <s id="s2274">If the diseased bone be a small one, and it be possible for you to extract it, then do so with a pair of fine forceps suited to the purpose.</s> <s id="s2275">And if there be a number of bones then you must accurately carry out the extraction of all of them, and spare no effort to ensure that none is left.</s> <s id="s2276">If any ligaments lie in your way and there be no danger in incising them, then make an incision into the ligaments and whatever tissues are there, and free the bones.</s> <s id="s2277">If it is not possible for you to extract the bone immediately, apply over the wound something to induce suppuration, and leave it for some days until suppuration has set in in the tissues and ligaments around the bones.</s> <s id="s2278">Keep an eye on the wound lest the incision that you made during your operation close up; if you fear this, apply to it cotton wool soaked in sulphur beaten with olive-oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or in one of the green ointments.</s> <s id="s2279">Then, when those ligaments have been softened by putrefaction and the bones crumble, it will be easy to shift them and take them out.</s> <s id="s2280">If it be one large bone such as the tibia or the femur or the like, and the diseased part be only the surface, then scrape it thoroughly until all the blackness and corruption is gone, then close the wound.</s> <s id="s2281">If the corrupt portion be very extensive and reach to the marrow of the bone, you will not be able to avoid sawing it off and cutting it all away to the point where the corruption ends; then dress until healed.</s> </p>
<p id="p379"><s id="s2282"> Now I shall tell you of a defluxion that once occurred in a man's leg, as an example and a help to you in your treatment.</s> <s id="s2283">This man was young, about thirty years of age.</s> <s id="s2284">He once got a pain in the leg from something internal, which so worked that eventually matter came into the leg and caused it to swell greatly, there being no external cause.</s> <s id="s2285">And time passed by, to the accompaniment of error on the part of the doctors, until the tumour opened and much discharge came away; and the treatment was so mismanaged that fistulae formed in the leg and many sinuses opened up, all of which discharged pus and body humours.</s> <s id="s2286">A whole host of doctors had been treating it for a matter of two years, not one of whom had any skill in the surgical art.</s> <s id="s2287">Eventually he sought me.</s> <s id="s2288">I saw his leg, with matter coming away from the orifices in large quantities; and the man's body was wasted and jaundiced.</s> <s id="s2289">So I introduced a probe into one of the openings and the probe touched bone.</s> <s id="s2290">Then I investigated all the openings and found them all communicating with one another in all parts of the leg.</s> <s id="s2291">So I quickly cut down upon one of these openings until a part of the bone was laid bare, and I found it diseased, by now eaten away, and black and foul and full of holes, down to the marrow.</s> <s id="s2292">So I sawed off as much of the diseased bone as I had exposed and could get at.</s> <s id="s2293">In fact I thought that there was no more disease in the bone beyond what I had cut and sawn away, and that I had completely eradicated it.</s> <s id="s2294">Then I tried for a very long time to heal the wound with medicines encouraging growth of flesh, but it would not heal.</s> <s id="s2295">Then I again uncovered the bone, above the first opening, and found the corruption co-extensive with the bone.</s> <s id="s2296">So again I sawed away as much of the corruption as I could see; then I tried to heal it, but it would not heal nor unite.</s> <s id="s2297">Then I opened it up once more and went on cutting away the bone piecemeal and trying to heal it, and it would not heal until I had cut away about a span of bone with the marrow; then I treated it medicinally and it quickly healed over and was cured.</s> <s id="s2298">But it would not have been necessary to repeat the operation and the incision thus, were it not for the patient's weakness and inability to tolerate much at a time, and because of my fears for his life, since an evil faint was constantly seizing him on account of the heavy drain.</s> <s id="s2299">But he was completely cured, and in place of the bone there grew up firm tissue; his bodily state was sound and his strength was restored.</s> <s id="s2300">He went about his business, and no hurt whatsoever came to him from walking.</s> </p>
<p id="p380"><s id="s2301"> Now in the case of a prominent bone that has been broken in any part of the body, it should be sawn off in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it to the extremity of the prominent bone and bid someone keep it stretched upward; then you put on another ligature of wool thicker than the first, tying it to the tissue that is beneath the bone, and pull on the end so that the flesh is drawn down and you lay bare of flesh the spot where you intend to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.</s> <s id="s2302">You should place a block of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone; which done, there is no hindrance to the saw's cutting through the diseased bone.</s> <s id="s2303">The saw-cut should be made a little above the site of the disease in case there should be disease in the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface, which might compel you to carry out the sawing a second time.</s> <s id="s2304">If the bone be diseased without any swelling, but it all seems the same from one part to another, and the disease be in the middle or in one segment of it, then expose it on all sides; put the block beneath, and saw it from the first side, where the disease is.</s> <s id="s2305">When you have finished this, saw it from the other side.</s> <s id="s2306">The saw-cut should be at a little distance from the diseased part, as we have already said.</s> </p>
<p id="p381"><s id="s2307"> If the disease be in one of the phalanges, amputate the diseased phalanx and saw through the bone where it is continuous on the other (healthy) side.</s> <s id="s2308">If the disease be in the joint between two members, then there is nothing to be done but scraping.</s> <s id="s2309">If the disease be in the carpus or tarsus it is a very difficult matter treating them; you must peel off the disease in whatever way seems possible, and scrape it away and clean up the part in whatever way you can and by whatever technique is convenient for you, so long as there is no vein or nerve in your way.</s> <s id="s2310">Now you should know that there are a great number of cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones, varying according to the different sites and arrangements of the bones; their thickness or thinness; their greatness or smallness; their hardness or sponginess; so you should have ready for every sort of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.</s> <s id="s2311">You should know too that when you have long experience and knowledge of the branches of this art the operations themselves may well indicate the kind of instrument needed; for the man who is skilled in the art and has seen various kinds of disease may think out for himself which instrument is suitable for each disease.</s> <s id="s2312">At the end of this chapter I give you illustrations of a number of instruments as types for you to copy and as a pattern upon which you can base others, God willing:</s> </p>

<p id="p394"><s id="s2363"> When an abscess occurs in any of the fleshy parts and becomes chronic and eventually collects pus, and then it breaks open or is perforated, and all the contained matter comes out and the site is left hollow, like a vessel, and the overlying skin thinned like a rag, but the suppuration has not gone so far as to involve bone or tendon or ligament—and hence it merits the name of 'sinus' and is not called a fistula.</s> <s id="s2364">But if it goes on until the disease involves any of these parts it is then called a fistula or defluxion.</s> </p>
<p id="p395"><s id="s2365"> The treatment of it will be to cut away all that skin with a circular incision; specially if it be thinned and has become like a rag, and you are sure that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.</s> <s id="s2366">But if you are in hope of its adhering, and the corruption has not reached that point, and there is in the skin some thickness of flesh, then treat it by irrigation.</s> <s id="s2367">The procedure is that you examine the sinus, and if it be large and the purulent discharge from it smell bad, then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts of each, mixed in a vessel and heated on the fire until the compound thickens and assumes the consistency of honey.</s> <s id="s2368">Then take as much as you need and dilute it with water and honey, and with this irrigate the sinus and bind up the opening, leaving the compound inside for two hours.</s> <s id="s2369">Then get it out by pressure.</s> <s id="s2370">Do this for several days until the sinus is clean and the smell disappears.</s> <s id="s2371">It may be irrigated with water of ashes if the medicine is not at hand.</s> <s id="s2372">For that, you take ashes of vine or of oak, and put water upon them; then clarify the liquor and with it irrigate the sinus until you are sure it is thoroughly clean.</s> <s id="s2373">But if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then irrigate him with water and honey with which a little pounded verdigris has been mixed; or irrigate with honey and wine mingled; the value of the honey lies in its cleansing and washing, while the wine closes up the sinus, specially if it be a wine which has some dryness and astringency.</s> <s id="s2374">When you have done this several times and you are sure that the sinus is clean of diseased matter, then irrigate it with those compounds that will encourage granulation in it.</s> <s id="s2375">For example, you may take a little Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and some astringent wine; or irrigate it with some of the other ointments and medicines whose prescriptions we have recorded in the treatise on ointments.</s> <s id="s2376">If the opening of the sinus be too narrow for the nozzle of the syringe, open it up slightly with the knife, or put in it a pad steeped in Egyptian ointment or vermilion ointment, until it is dilated.</s> <s id="s2377">On the other hand, if the opening be wide, bring the edges together with a suture, and leave of it sufficient width that the syringe may be only just introduced.</s> <s id="s2378">In the same way, if the opening from which the discharge flows be raised up, then incise it at its lowest part so that the discharge may flow downward out of it; for when the discharge collects at the bottom of the sinus it prevents the formation of flesh in it.</s> <s id="s2379">If you cannot open it up as you wish at the lower point, then try to set the part in whatever position you conveniently can to facilitate the discharge of pus, and try to ensure that no pus is held up in it.</s> </p>
<p id="p396"><s id="s2380"> As for the consolidating medicaments that are applied externally to the sinus, and the manner of their application: you take one of the ointments suited to your purpose, and spread it on a piece of lint of sufficient size to cover the whole sinus; then with scissors cut a hole in the lint over the mouth of the sinus and a little wider than the sinus opening; then spread on another piece of lint a quantity of softening ointment proportionate to the opening and put the one on the other so that it stands away from the opening of the sinus, in order to ease the discharge of pus from it; and do not remove the larger dressing until after many days.</s> <s id="s2381">But the dressing over the sinus opening you may constantly remove, so that the pus collected behind it may come out and so that you may know whether there be much or little ichor, and whether digested or not.</s> <s id="s2382">And at the same time investigate the site of the sinus itself to see whether the patient feels any pain in it or no pain, and whether there be any swelling in it or not.</s> <s id="s2383">Then when your treatment has reached such a point that you see that there is only a little superficial matter coming out round the mouth of the sinus, you may know that the sinus has closed up or is near to closing up.</s> <s id="s2384">Then you may unbandage it the next day or the third day, and when the wound is unbandaged make a change of dressing and ointment.</s> <s id="s2385">But if, after a long while, the sinus discharges a thin ichor, do not despair of its closing up, for its healing is near.</s> <s id="s2386">For there are some men whose wounds are slow in healing, and some are the opposite.</s> </p>
<p id="p397"><s id="s2387"> If, after many days, undigested pus is discharged you may know that the sinus has not closed.</s> <s id="s2388">If the closing of the sinus be delayed and it be a long affair, make the medicines dryer; let them be medicines that have some humidity in their substance but dryness in their potency, such as Palm ointment with the addition of excess of rock-alum.</s> <s id="s2389">A most efficacious treatment is to take Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and sprinkle over it old wine of even consistency.</s> <s id="s2390">Then knead together, and use that.</s> <s id="s2391">The same sort of thing may be done with honey if you have no</s> </p>
<p id="p398"><s id="s2392"> Palm ointment at hand; if you heat the honey to a thick consistency and use that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense of juniper and beat them all up together and sprinkle on the honey while it is heating on the fire, spread on lint and bind over the sinus; or spread on it honey heated to a thickness, and over that sprinkle powdered aromatic roots, and over these place a dressing that you bandage on.</s> <s id="s2393">Sometimes also in a case of this sort long birthwort and the root of the blue iris and vetch flour and centaury are usable, either separately or mixed, beaten up together, sifted and scattered into honey as I described; use them thus.</s> <s id="s2394">But if the sinus be chronic, and it does not heal with this treatment, then you may know that there is corruption at the bottom of it, which has affected the bones or motor nerves or ligaments; the treatment then is that of fistula as already given.</s> </p>

<p id="p404"><s id="s2423"> The incision is done thus: the leg is first well fomented with hot water to liquefy the thick foul blood; then bind up the patient's leg well from the upper part of his thigh to below the knee; then make an ample incision into the vein in one, two, or three places.</s> <s id="s2424">Then with your hand press the black blood upward from the lower part and downward from the upper part of the leg and draw off as much blood as you see suffices or as the patient's strength can bear.</s> <s id="s2425">Then bind up, and bid him abstain from foods that give rise to black bile.</s> <s id="s2426">The evacuation and venesection should be repeated whenever the veins fill up again to the patient's hurt.</s> </p>

<p id="p419"><s id="s2522"> Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them.</s> <s id="s2523">A skilful worker will form a judgement on much, from little; and on what is not present from what is before him; and he will think out a new method and a new instrument for an unaccustomed case when it occurs in the practice of this art.</s> <s id="s2524">So I would state that arrows come out from the parts of the body they have transfixed, in two ways: either by drawing out from the site of entry; or from the opposite side.</s> <s id="s2525">An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling.</s> <s id="s2526">If it does not respond to traction immediately it strikes, you must leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have suppurated, when the pulling and extraction of it will be made easy.</s> <s id="s2527">Similarly if it has stuck fast in a bone and will not come out, leave this also for a few days, repeatedly pulling on it and shifting it day by day, and then it will come out.</s> <s id="s2528">But if it will not come out after some days, you will have to drill away the bone from all round with a fine drill so as to make room for the arrow; then draw on it and pull it out.</s> </p>
<p id="p420"><s id="s2529"> If the arrow is buried in some part of the body and is quite lost to sight, explore for it with a probe, and if you can feel it then draw it out with any suitable instrument.</s> <s id="s2530">But if you cannot get at it on account of the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is, and there be no bone nor nerve nor blood-vessel, then cut round it until the wound be sufficiently wide to enable you to take hold of it and extract it.</s> <s id="s2531">And if it have two barbs by which it is held, free them from the adherent flesh all round, in any way you can; or, if you cannot free the tissues, try skilfully to break off the two barbs and twist them about until the arrow comes free.</s> </p>
<p id="p421"><s id="s2532"> Whenever you try to extract an arrow from any part, employ a twisting motion of your hand with the forceps in all directions until you free it; and use the utmost gentleness not to break the arrow and thus make it hard to draw it out and remove it.</s> <s id="s2533">If you are unable to get it out at once then leave it for some days until the tissues that surround it putrefy, then return to it, for then the extraction will be easy; and if haemorrhage interfere use the remedies prescribed in the chapter dealing with that.</s> <s id="s2534">Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you.</s> <s id="s2535">When extracting an arrow you should place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is more convenient; but if you cannot do this then let him be in whatever position is possible for you.</s> <s id="s2536">The arrow that is to be extracted from the opposite side either has some part protruding through or else the tip of the arrow gives rise to a palpable swelling just beneath the skin and you see it sticking out; then cut down upon it; the incision should be wide enough to admit the forceps.</s> <s id="s2537">Then pull on it, for the extraction of it will be easy.</s> <s id="s2538">If it is stuck in bone, twist it round with your hand until the arrow makes an impression in the bone and opens up a way for itself; then pull it.</s> <s id="s2539">If it does not come out, let it alone for some days, and repeat until it does come out.</s> <s id="s2540">If the arrow-shaft be in the wound, then thrust the arrow out with that.</s> <s id="s2541">But if the shaft has fallen out, and you wish to employ thrusting, introduce down to it the hollow instrument whose cavity will enter upon the ferrule of the arrow, then push it forward with that.</s> <s id="s2542">If the arrow be hollow, thrust it forward with an instrument that will enter into the cavity, for the exit of the arrow will thereby be made easy.</s> </p>

<p id="p425"><s id="s2555"> The blood-vessels in the body which it is customary to open are thirty(two) in number.</s> <s id="s2556">There are sixteen of them in the head, and they are: two pulsating vessels behind the ears that are called the two occipitals; the two external arteries in the temples; and the two veins in the two internal angles of the eyes, called the vessels of sight; and the vein running up the middle of the forehead; and the vein situated at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins in the neck; and the two veins in the upper lip and the two in the lower lip; these being the veins known as 'the four vessels'; and two veins beneath the tongue.</s> </p>
<p id="p426"><s id="s2557"> As for the veins that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five.</s> <s id="s2558">One is the cephalic, which is on the outer side; popularly they call it the 'headvein'; then there is the 'blue-black', that is, the median vein, which is made up of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic; popularly they call that the 'body-vein'; then the basilic vein; this is the one situated on the inner side and is termed also the axillary vein, but popularly it is called the 'belly-vein'; and then the cord of the arm; this is situated over the radius and is the one that is contiguous to it; this is the one that is clearly visible on the thumb.</s> <s id="s2559">And the salvatella which is the vein between the little and ring fingers; it has two branches.</s> <s id="s2560">There are also three veins in the leg and foot; one of these is the sciatic vein on the outer aspect; the second is the saphena situated near the heel on the inner aspect; and there is the external saphena situated near the heel on the outer aspect.</s> <s id="s2561">And there are three veins, counterparts to these, in the other leg.</s> <s id="s2562">Venesection of the two veins behind the ears.</s> <s id="s2563">Bleeding from both of these will give relief in cases of chronic catarrh, migraine and chronic foul pustules, and scabs of the head.</s> <s id="s2564">The method of venesecting these two is as I shall now describe: the patient's head should be shaved and the hinder part, in the region of the two veins, should be strongly chafed with a rough cloth; then the patient should bind his neck with his turban until the two veins are visible; their position is behind the ears in the two flattened places of the head; feel for them with your finger and when you feel their pulsation beneath your finger then mark the place with ink.</s> <s id="s2565">Then take a knife-scalpel, known as a lancet, and insert it beneath the vessel into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone; then lifting with your hand both vessel and skin make an incision dividing both skin and vein; the length of the incision should be about two fingers side by side; then draw off the quantity of blood you wish.</s> <s id="s2566">Then bind them up with dressings and leave it until healed.</s> <s id="s2567">The incision and cauterization of these two vessels has been discussed earlier in the book.</s> <s id="s2568">The section of the two arteries in the temples gives relief for chronic migraine and severe headache and constant ophthalmia and the flow of acrid superfluities into the eyes.</s> <s id="s2569">Now the manner of incising them is as I shall describe: the patient should bind his neck with a sash until the vessels stand out clearly to the eye and their pulsation is manifest under your finger; then mark with ink.</s> <s id="s2570">Then with your forefinger raise the skin over the vessel and introduce a lancet beneath and lift up the vein and divide it as you did the other two; and draw off as much blood as you need.</s> <s id="s2571">Then loosen the band round the patient's neck and put your finger on the vein for a while; then apply cotton wool and a pad, bandage securely, and leave until it heals.</s> <s id="s2572">They and their incision and extraction have been mentioned earlier in the book.</s> </p>
<p id="p427"><s id="s2573"> Venesection of the vein in the forehead is, after venesection of the cephalic, a relief to chronic diseases of the face such as pustules and scabs and erysipelas.</s> <s id="s2574">Now I shall relate to you the method of cutting: you bind the patient's neck until the vessel stands out; then you take the instrument called the 'pickaxe'.</s> <s id="s2575">The spike in the head of the instrument you place on the vessel itself and then strike with a comb or some similar thing; and let the blood flow to the extent you wish; then loosen the band round the neck and bandage the vein until healed.</s> <s id="s2576">Sometimes it is opened with a broad scalpel; the scalpel, however, should not have a sharp point like other scalpels but should be a little broader at the tip, and the vein is cut obliquely, because the bone is close and the scalpel, if it is too fine, may be broken on it.</s> </p>
<p id="p428"><s id="s2577"> Venesection of the two lachrymal veins gives relief in diseases of the eyes such as granular conjunctiva and inflammation and pannus, and in diseases of the face.</s> <s id="s2578">Now this is the method of incising: the patient binds a sash round his throat, then you cut open both veins, standing in front of him.</s> <s id="s2579">The incision should be oblique, slightly longitudinal, with a small, rather broad scalpel, for in this place there is no flesh; so if the knife have too narrow a point it may be broken on the bone.</s> <s id="s2580">Then let flow what blood you wish, put cotton wool on both, tie for one night, then loosen.</s> </p>
<p id="p429"><s id="s2581"> Venesection of the vein of the nose helps in acute fevers, in violent headache, and in diseases of the face such as the red pustules that arise on the nose, especially if they are chronic.</s> <s id="s2582">This is how you make the incision: the patient binds his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a long fine scalpel and stick it in the middle of the very lobule of the nose, perpendicularly in the nasal septum (for the vein is not obvious at that spot) and blood will immediately flow out.</s> <s id="s2583">You should advance the scalpel a little and cause the blood to flow as required; then bandage for one night, for it will quickly heal.</s> <s id="s2584">Venesection of the jugular veins helps tightness of breath and the early stage of elephantiasis, and the melancholic diseases arising on the surface of the skin, such as the black vitiligo and impetigo and malignant ulcers and cancrum oris.</s> <s id="s2585">Now the way to venesect them is for the patient to bind his neck below them both with a band; let the operator stand behind the patient and let the patient be seated upon a chair.</s> <s id="s2586">Then incise the vein longitudinally with a rather wide opening; then let a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you think necessary; then do the same with the other vein.</s> <s id="s2587">Then loosen the band and tie the veins with a moderate pressure lest the patient be suffocated; leave him until the next day and the wound will be healed.</s> </p>
<p id="p430"><s id="s2588"> The four veins of the lips: venesection of them is effective, second to section of the cephalic vein, for pustules on the mouth and rotting of the gums and malignant ulcers and fissures of the lips and for malignant ulcer in the nose and round about.</s> <s id="s2589">The way to venesect is to seat the patient in front of you and bind a sash round his neck, then roll back his lips and look for the two veins, one of which you will see to the left and the other to the right; their dark colour will show them up against the lip and also the fact that round them are fine dark veins; so cut down upon both, dividing them.</s> <s id="s2590">But if you are in doubt about the matter and are not sure what they are, set about incising the largest and most obvious.</s> <s id="s2591">Do the same with the two veins in the upper lip.</s> <s id="s2592">The two veins under the tongue: their venesection is, after section of the cephalic, of good effect in the quinsy arising in the throat from disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.</s> <s id="s2593">The way to venesect them is to seat the patient before you in the sunlight and raise his tongue, and look, and you will see beneath the tongue one vein on each side, blackish in colour.</s> <s id="s2594">Cut them; but be careful not to go too far in your incision, for beneath them lie arteries from which there may be haemorrhage.</s> <s id="s2595">The three veins that are opened in the elbow are the veins which universal custom has used for bloodletting.</s> <s id="s2596">There are two ways of venesecting these: either by piercing with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel or a rather fine olivary; or by cutting with a knife-edged scalpel, the lancet whose figure follows.</s> <s id="s2597">The broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.</s> <s id="s2598">As you see, it should be broad so as to serve for opening hollow, full, outstanding, obvious and thick veins, and those containing turbid blood.</s> <s id="s2599">The olivary scalpel.</s> <s id="s2600">This scalpel is less broad and finer-pointed.</s> <s id="s2601">It is suitable for venesecting fine veins that contain thin jaundiced blood.</s> <s id="s2602">The lancet.</s> <s id="s2603">This is the lancet for making a slit.</s> <s id="s2604">There are broad and narrow varieties of it according to the breadth or narrowness of the vein.</s> <s id="s2605">This one indicates what the others are like; it is well known to surgeons.</s> <s id="s2606">The basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, helps, when cut, by extracting blood from disorders below the throat and neck, in the parts neighbouring the chest and abdomen.</s> <s id="s2607">When one venesects it one must be careful and wary of it, for beneath the vein is an artery, so that if one is inaccurate and sticks the scalpel in too far one will cut the artery and cause a haemorrhage; therefore venesection of it should not be done with a transfixing scalpel but should be an incision with the lancet.</s> <s id="s2608">If the basilic vein is not clearly discernible, leave it and turn to another, or look for a branch of it; or venesect the brachial cord instead, for that is evident; incise it with the lancet as we have said.</s> <s id="s2609">But if you wish to open the basilic vein itself you should, before you bandage the arm, palpate the place till the site of pulsation is found; then mark it with ink; then bind the arm and cut the vein obliquely with the lancet as we said, and take care that the stroke fall some way from the artery.</s> <s id="s2610">If, when tying the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you have marked with ink, that swelling is the inflation of the artery, so avoid it.</s> <s id="s2611">And if, on section, you see the blood spurt out like a child's urine, and it is clear and red, then you may know that it is arterial blood; so then be quick and put your finger upon it for a long while; then remove your finger and if the bleeding stops, as it often will, then bind up the arm and leave it.</s> <s id="s2612">Caution the patient against neglecting it; let him be careful and not move it for some days, until it heals.</s> <s id="s2613">But if the bleeding is not stayed but resists your treatment and you have no medicament there at the time, then cut the vessel through if you can see it; for the two ends will contract and the haemorrhage will stop.</s> <s id="s2614">Or else take a pistachio nut shell and split it and take one half and bind it over the site of the haemorrhage with a pad and bandage until next day.</s> <s id="s2615">The bleeding may stop; if not, then treat by those means mentioned previously, namely the application of styptic powders.</s> <s id="s2616">It is not difficult in most cases to stop the bleeding, because the wound is small and it is easy to bandage the arm.</s> <s id="s2617">So get to know it.</s> <s id="s2618">Venesection of the median vein results in drawing off blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; this being due to the fact, as we said, that it is composed of a branch of the cephalic and a branch of the basilic veins.</s> <s id="s2619">The venesector should be very careful in opening it because there is a nerve beneath;

<p id="p440"><s id="s2711"> CHAPTER NINETY-SIX.</s> <s id="s2712">On cupping and the manner of employing it.</s> </p>
<p id="p441"><s id="s2713"> Cupping-vessels are made of horn, wood, bronze, or glass.</s> <s id="s2714">Cupping is carried out in two ways: one with scarification and drawing blood, and the other without scarification.</s> <s id="s2715">The latter, cupping without scarification, may be carried out in two ways: with fire and without fire.</s> </p>
<p id="p442"><s id="s2716"> The points at which cupping with scarification and extraction of blood is performed are fourteen places in the body: the occiput, which is the back of the head; the interscapular region, which is the middle of the back of the neck; the two sides of the neck, equally on both sides; the chin, that is, beneath the lower jaw; the two shoulders; the coccyx, at the base of the tail; the antibrachium, the middle of the forearms; the two legs; and the two heel-veins.</s> </p>
<p id="p443"><s id="s2717"> What cupping does is to draw blood out of the fine vessels dispersed over the flesh; for this reason it does not cause the strength to decline as does venesection; nor may you use cupping, either with fire or without fire, in any disease due to plethora, until the whole body has been evacuated.</s> <s id="s2718">If disease or custom prescribe cupping we may apply it at any hour, at the beginning or end or middle of the month, at whatever time it may be.</s> <s id="s2719">For there are some people who, when there is an abundance of blood in them, so as to need cupping, feel heaviness and pain in the head.</s> <s id="s2720">Some find they have a fullness and redness of the face and also of the head and neck; some have an itching in their face and forehead and a dimness and irritation in their eyes.</s> <s id="s2721">There are some who scratch the places where the cupping-vessels are applied; some laugh immoderately; some find a taste of blood in the mouth, and the gums swell up and they spit blood; some sleep overmuch; some frequently dream of seeing blood and redness and murdered men and wounds and the like.</s> <s id="s2722">So when we see anything of this kind, and especially if it be in the middle third of the month, we thereupon prescribe cupping after the second or third hour of the day has passed.</s> </p>
<p id="p444"><s id="s2723"> The effect of cupping the nape of the neck is to help in heaviness of the head and in a fluxion of humours into the eyes; but it should be done after a complete evacuation of the body.</s> <s id="s2724">This use of cupping may take the place of venesection of the cephalic vein.</s> <s id="s2725">But anyone suffering from coldness of the brain or catarrh should beware of using it, for this will cause serious harm.</s> <s id="s2726">So it should not be employed on old men or on anyone suffering from a cold disease of the head.</s> <s id="s2727">If anyone becomes addicted to it it brings about oblivion.</s> <s id="s2728">You should therefore bid the cupper bring the cupping-vessel a little lower down lest oblivion supervene.</s> </p>
<p id="p445"><s id="s2729"> Now as to the application of cupping-vessels to the interscapular region: it is instead of venesection of the median and basilic veins; so it is effective for asthma and dyspnoea and for rupture of the organ of respiration, and for cough and plethora.</s> <s id="s2730">The cupping of the interscapular region should be made a little high, for if it is too low it will bring about weakness of the heart and stomach.</s> <s id="s2731">Cupping the sides of the neck helps in pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, and in quinsy and in pain at the roots of the teeth; it replaces venesection of the basilic vein.</s> <s id="s2732">And you should bid the cupper not to scarify very deeply lest he cut an artery and cause haemorrhage.</s> </p>
<p id="p446"><s id="s2733"> The application of cupping under thé chin helps against ulcers in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar diseases of the mouth ; and may replace venesection of the four labial vessels.</s> <s id="s2734">The application of cupping to the shoulders helps in palpitation of the heart arising from plethora and heat.</s> <s id="s2735">The application of cupping to the inside of the forearms helps in place of venesection of the three veins, namely the basilic, median, and cephalic; for it draws blood from all the capillaries of the flesh.</s> <s id="s2736">These capillaries draw blood from other larger veins till the drawing reaches those three great veins.</s> <s id="s2737">You should bid the person who applies the vessels not to scarify deeply; for the place is bare of flesh and there are tendons and arteries beneath.</s> <s id="s2738">The application of a single cupping-vessel to the coccyx is effective for haemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers of the lower abdomen.</s> <s id="s2739">You must tell the cupper that the cupping-vessel should be large and of bronze, for the place requires strong suction, and a glass cupping-vessel may break; and he should scarify deeply.</s> <s id="s2740">Cupping applied to both legs reduces plethora manifestly, because it draws off blood from the whole body, and so is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys and uterus and bladder; and brings on the menses.</s> <s id="s2741">It also serves for pustules and boils; and takes the place of venesection of the saphenous veins and the heel-veins.</s> <s id="s2742">But it greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people.</s> <s id="s2743">The advantage of cupping of the heel-veins is much the same as that of the legs.</s> <s id="s2744">The way to apply the cupping-vessels: the vessel is first put in position empty; then you suck moderately; do not long hold the cupping-vessel in place, but apply it quickly and remove it quickly so that the humours gather evenly at the place; and go on doing it time after time until the place is seen to redden and to swell, and the redness of blood is manifested.</s> <s id="s2745">Then scarify, and repeat the suction very gently; then consider the bodily condition.</s> <s id="s2746">The person who is tender of flesh and porous of skin you should scarify once only, not more, lest the place ulcerate.</s> <s id="s2747">Tell him who applies the cupping-vessels to scarify rather widely and deeply, and to control the suction with gentleness and a delicate motion.</s> <s id="s2748">If there be a thickness of the blood he should scarify twice; the first time to make a way out for the thinner blood and serum; and the second time to complete the extraction of the thick blood.</s> <s id="s2749">If the blood be very turbid let him scarify a third time for completion.</s> <s id="s2750">In general, one scarification is enough when we wish to draw a little thick blood; but if we wish to draw much blood we make more scarifications.</s> <s id="s2751">If we judge that the blood is thick we should scarify deeply.</s> <s id="s2752">A fair depth for the scarification is the thickness of the skin, and no more.</s> </p>
<p id="p447"><s id="s2753"> The oils and water to be used in applying cupping-vessels, and what he who is to be cupped should avoid.</s> <s id="s2754">He whose skin is thick, solid, desiccated, and narrow of pore: the operator should anoint the place with opening and emollient and resolving oils; if it be in the summer season, with, for example, oil of yellow gilliflower or of violets or of sweet almonds or of pumpkin-seeds.</s> <s id="s2755">If it be in winter, with narcissus oil or oil of lilies or camomile oil, or of jasmine, or the like.</s> <s id="s2756">And if the superfluity be thick and cold, then with oil of marjoram or oil of wild thyme or oil of ben or oil of dill.</s> <s id="s2757">If he who is to be cupped has wide-open pores and tender flesh, he should be forbidden oil.</s> <s id="s2758">After cupping, such people should wash the sites with rose-water or cold water or water of black nightshade or of gourds or of garden purslain, or the like.</s> <s id="s2759">But he whose blood is very humid should wash the sites of his cupping with vinegar or water of myrtle or sumac, and the like.</s> <s id="s2760">He that has thick superfluities should wash the sites of his cupping with old wine or water of purslain or decoction of dill or of camomile or the like.</s> <s id="s2761">One should beware of cupping in the bath or just after the bath, but should use the vessels one or two hours after leaving the bath.</s> <s id="s2762">And no one should sleep after cupping.</s> </p>
<p id="p448"><s id="s2763"> The correct procedure to be observed before and after cupping by him who is to be cupped or venesected.</s> <s id="s2764">It is necessary for you first to consider, and if he that is to be cupped or venesected be bilious, and bitterness and inflammation prevail in his blood, he should take cooling things such as pomegranates and endive with vinegar and lettuce and oxymel and julep, and the like.</s> <s id="s2765">His diet should be chicken and mutton made into stews with vinegar, and soups with verjuice, and the like.</s> <s id="s2766">The man of frigid constitution should drink syrup of honey or syrup of quince or spiced oxymel; he should also take perfumed raisin wine, not too old and not too new; he should be bidden to be moderate in eating and should make his diet young pullets and larks and sparrows and young pigeons in white stews.</s> <s id="s2767">And on the day of cupping and venesection he should drink rather than eat.</s> <s id="s2768">It may sometimes be necessary to have some people drink the great theriac or musk-medicine or shllitha before cupping and before or after venesection, to strengthen the chief parts and to render the blood thin; but these draughts should not be given to the feverish.</s> </p>
<p id="p449"><s id="s2769"> Cupping without scarification is the cupping practised on the liver, the spleen, the breasts, the belly, the umbilicus, the region of the kidneys and the acetabulum of the femur; for these parts do not tolerate scarification.</s> <s id="s2770">Now the purpose of the vessels is either to draw blood from one part to another, as when we apply cups over the breasts in the case of nose-bleed; or to loosen from the part a frigid vapour that has become fixed in it, as when we place cupping-vessels on the abdomen and umbilicus; for they stimulate the part and warm it and remove the pain because they loosen the vapour.</s> <s id="s2771">Sometimes they are applied over the kidneys when there is an obstruction or stones in them; for often, by virtue of their drawing, the obstruction is opened up or the stones are dislodged from their site.</s> <s id="s2772">They act in the same way when they are applied over the liver and the spleen when flatus is permeating them.</s> <s id="s2773">These cupping-vessels may be used empty with suction only; or they may be used with fire.</s> <s id="s2774">Sometimes in pleuritic complaints they are applied filled with tepid water.</s> <s id="s2775">This is done by filling the vessel, which should be large, with plain hot water, or with hot water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.</s> <s id="s2776">Then it is applied to the place, full, and held there, then removed; and the process repeated as often as is necessary.</s> </p>
<p id="p450"><s id="s2777"> This is the figure of the cupping-vessel for use with fire.</s> <s id="s2778">Its mouth should be the width of two opened fingers, as we have illustrated; the depth should be half a span; and in the side about halfway down there should be a small hole of a size to admit a needle.</s> <s id="s2779">It should be made of Chinese bronze or of brass.</s> <s id="s2780">The edge should be thick, smooth, even, and polished, so as not to injure the part to which it is applied.</s> <s id="s2781">And in the middle there should be a transverse rod of bronze or iron to carry the lighted lamp.</s> <s id="s2782">You may make this kind of cupping-vessel in a large size, larger than we have described; and in a small size too, to suit various ailments and the age of the user.</s> <s id="s2783">For the cupping-vessels for boys and thin persons differ from those for men and stout persons.</s> </p>
<p id="p451"><s id="s2784"> Now this is the manner of applying this cupping-vessel with fire to a part of the body.</s> <s id="s2785">You set light to a strongly twisted wick of linen or a small wax candle, and you set it on the middle of the cross-piece in the middle of the vessel so that the flame be directed toward the lower part of the cupping vessel and not burn the patient's body.</s> <s id="s2786">Then the vessel should be placed on the part with the finger kept over the above-mentioned hole; then when we have held the vessel sufficiently long there the finger is taken away, the vapour will come out through the hole, and the vessel will become loosened at once.</s> <s id="s2787">Then light the wick as prescribed and repeat if necessary.</s> <s id="s2788">But the cupping-vessel that is used in pleurisy, with water, has no cross-piece nor hole; it is used by simply filling with water and applying to the part.</s> <s id="s2789">This is the figure of it.</s> <s id="s2790">Now the larger this cupping-vessel is, to hold much water, the better.</s> </p>

<p id="p456"><s id="s2807"> This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.</s> <s id="s2808">You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.</s> <s id="s2809">For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.</s> <s id="s2810">Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice.</s> <s id="s2811">So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly.</s> <s id="s2812">I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.</s> <s id="s2813">And there is no power save in God the High, the Great.</s> </p>
<div n="1" type="subchapter">
<p id="p457"><s id="s2814"> CHAPTER ONE.</s> <s id="s2815">In which is given the necessary compendious preliminary information on fractures.</s> </p>
<p id="p458"><s id="s2816"> Before we begin to speak of the fractures and dislocations of individual members we must, as an introduction to this book, give the general and particular information which compels your understanding and your being versed in it; both you and anyone else beside who is eager to learn this noble art.</s> <s id="s2817">So I say that when anyone has sustained a fracture or dislocation or luxation or fall, you should first hasten to venesect him, or get his bowel open, or both, if there be nothing to hinder such as physical weakness, or unless it be a small boy or a very old man to whom an accident of this kind has happened; or unless the weather be excessively hot or cold.</s> <s id="s2818">Next, let his diet be restricted to cold vegetables and the flesh of fowl and kids; he is to be forbidden wine and rich meat and gluttony and all foods that fill out the blood-vessels, until you are sure that there is no abscess and see no reason to suspect a flux of matter to the place.</s> <s id="s2819">Then let the patient return to his former diet according to his custom.</s> <s id="s2820">When the broken bone has begun to mend, the patient should be nourished with very nourishing food, fat, strong, having some glutinous property, such as porridge, rice, heads, trotters, the tripe of cows, eggs, fresh fish, heavy wine, and the like; for on this diet the mending of the fracture will be quicker and better.</s> </p>
<p id="p459"><s id="s2821"> You should know that fractures occurring in mature and old people cannot join and mend into the original condition, on account of the dryness and hardness of their bones; though any bones that are extremely soft, like those of infants, may make a union and heal.</s> <s id="s2822">Yet nature produces around the bone on all sides something like glue, with a certain viscosity, with whose help it joins, and it binds so that one part adheres to the other and they are linked to one another until it be good and firm as it had been before; so that there is no impediment to any of its functions.</s> <s id="s2823">It is on this account that the patient's food should be the sort that has solidity and glueyness and thickness, as we have said.</s> <s id="s2824">You should know that there are as many different types of fracture as there are members.</s> <s id="s2825">Thus a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the cranium; and a fracture of the breast bone differs from a fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly there are differences among the other parts.</s> <s id="s2826">We shall give an exposition of each kind of fracture, each in its own chapter and distinguished from the others.</s> <s id="s2827">The fracture of each bone also has its own variations; for the fracture may be a clean break without splintering; or the fracture may be along the bone, with splinters and projections which may be sharp or may not; and the fracture may involve a wound and a laceration of the skin; and the fracture may be a crack.</s> <s id="s2828">Each kind has its own special technique of setting which will be mentioned in detail, each in its place.</s> </p>
<p id="p460"><s id="s2829"> Among the diagnostic signs of a broken bone are: distortion, protrusion, the aspect of it, and the crepitus when you press on it with the hand.</s> <s id="s2830">When there is no obvious distortion or crepitus at the site, nor do you feel movement when you manipulate the bone, and the patient does not experience severe pain, there is no fracture there.</s> <s id="s2831">But it is possible that there is a luxation or a slight fracture or a little crack; so you must not disturb it with any extension or pressure, but apply one of the remedies suitable to the site, such as will be described later; then bind up gently.</s> <s id="s2832">If the bone is parted and broken in two and there is no fragmentation but a simple separation of one part from its fellow, then you should lose no time in straightening and aligning it before an abscess sets in.</s> <s id="s2833">If an abscess does set in, then let a few days pass until it has subsided; then gently and skilfully straighten it in whatever way you can.</s> <s id="s2834">You should know that the setting or alignment of this is easier than that of a splintered bone.</s> <s id="s2835">Then bandage as will be prescribed.</s> <s id="s2836">But if the bone is splintered, extension from either side is necessary, whether it be hand or foot; with your own hands if it be a small member, or with two ropes or with one hand and a rope.</s> <s id="s2837">You should place the part on a flat surface in its natural attitude so that when both parts of the broken bone have been extended you can try to restore the fragments to their proper place with all the skill and gentleness possible; and do your utmost to ensure that the patient experience no pain or distress as you operate.</s> <s id="s2838">Try diligently to get one part of the bone fitted in the best form to the other.</s> <s id="s2839">At the same time you should palpate and investigate both of them with your hand, and if you find anything wrong then mend it and straighten it to the best of your ability.</s> <s id="s2840">But avoid violent extension or compression which many ignorant people apply; for by doing so they often cause abscess or crippling in the limb, as I myself have many times seen.</s> <s id="s2841">Then after you have exactly repositioned it and bandaged it, keep that limb still and quiet, and bid the patient beware of moving it while awake or asleep, and in his shifting and stirring, and in opening the bowel, and in every activity, to the utmost of his capacity; and that he should try to let the position of the limb be such that he is free from pain; when pain or distress is felt in any position in which he has disposed the limb, he should move it to a different position in which he feels no pain.</s> <s id="s2842">At the same time he should try to make that position even and straight, so that when the limb is mended there be no curvature in it.</s> </p>
<p id="p461"><s id="s2843"> As to the way to bandage a broken limb, it is as I shall now describe to you.</s> <s id="s2844">You should know that limbs which may be fractured vary in their size and shape.</s> <s id="s2845">The strips of bandage for those that are small, such as an arm or finger or forearm or the like, should be soft and fine, while those that are thick, such as the hip, back, or breast, should have broad and strong bandages.</s> <s id="s2846">For a broad bandage holds fast to a big limb, binding it all round with an even pressure so that no defect may occur.</s> <s id="s2847">Then, after you have finished the setting, begin by applying a suitable liniment on soft tow over the site of the fracture, then start to wrap the bandage over the actual site, three or four turns of bandage as the part may require, winding it fairly tight.</s> <s id="s2848">Then carry on the bandage above the site of the fracture, winding it more loosely than on the fractured place, and continue a little with the bandaging beyond the place of fracture, loosening the tension gradually, until you have taken up a good amount of the sound part.</s> <s id="s2849">Then take another bandage and wind it several turns over the fracture and then carry it over the part below the fracture, the tightness and looseness being arranged in the same way that we prescribed for the first covering, of the upper part.</s> <s id="s2850">Then put between the bandages enough soft tow or soft rags to correct the curves of the fracture, if any; otherwise put nothing in.</s> <s id="s2851">Then wind over it another bandage and at once lay over it strong splints, if the part be not swollen and effused.</s> <s id="s2852">But if there be swelling or effusion in the part, apply something to allay the swelling and disperse the effusion; leave it on for several days and then bind on the splints.</s> <s id="s2853">The splints should be made of broad halves of cane, cut and shaped with skill; or the splints may be made of the wood used for sieves, which are made of pine; or of palm branches; or of brier or giant fennel or the like, whatever wood be at hand.</s> <s id="s2854">The size of each splint should be of this form and shape, except that the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and broader than the others.</s> <s id="s2855">As to the length of the splint, it should be greater or less as suits the fractured part.</s> <s id="s2856">Figure of a splint.</s> <s id="s2857">Then bind over the splints another bandage just as tightly as you did your first; then over that tie it up with cords arranged in the way we have said, that is, with the pressure greatest over the site of the fracture and lessened as you move away from it.</s> <s id="s2858">The cords should be of medium thickness, of linen supple of quality.</s> <s id="s2859">For if the cords are too thick, such as I have seen ignorant people use who made their cords of twisted bands of linen, that will be a grave error, for moderate tension with these is impossible.</s> <s id="s2860">Nor are fine threads suitable either, for with these you cannot achieve sufficient tension.</s> <s id="s2861">Between splints there should be a space of not less than a finger's breadth.</s> <s id="s2862">If, after bandaging, the patient is hurt in the sound parts by the ends of the splints, then put a little soft tow or carded wool under them until they no longer hurt him thus.</s> <s id="s2863">As for the case of a fracture accompanied by an open wound, it will be mentioned in a special section on its own.</s> <s id="s2864">You should know that not every fracture should be bound up with splints on the first day; that is, when the part is big you should not apply splints until five or seven days after, or more, depending on when you are satisfied that there is no effusion.</s> <s id="s2865">This is a description of the plasters that the Ancients used for repair, applied to a fracture, dislocation, or sprain.</s> <s id="s2866">Description of a common simple plaster for the repair of fractures, suited to most constitutions, particularly for women and children, because in it there predominates neither hot nor cold.</s> <s id="s2867">Take mill-dust, that is, the fine flour that sticks to the walls of a mill as the grindstone moves.</s> <s id="s2868">Pound it as it is without sieving, with egg-white, to a medium consistency; then use.</s> <s id="s2869">Description of another plaster for the repair of a fracture, luxation, or dislocation: take ten drachms each of pulse, gum-mastic, acacia, elecampane, mughath, and sukk; five drachms each of myrrh and aloes; twenty drachms of tamarisk and twenty drachms of clay of Armenia or Asia Minor; all should be pounded fine and mixed with water of tamarisk, or with eggwhite if the patient be of a warm constitution; then use this plaster, which is excellent for uniting, quickly repairing broken bones, and suits most people because of its mildness.</s> </p>
<p id="p462"><s id="s2870"> Description of another plaster valuable for a fracture or sprain: let there be taken ten drachms each of mughath, pulse, and white marsh mallows, five drachms each of myrrh and aloes, six drachms of acacia, and twenty drachms of Armenian clay.</s> <s id="s2871">Let them all be well beaten up and passed through a sieve and made into a paste with water or egg-white and used.</s> <s id="s2872">Description of a plaster for dislocated joints or bones, soothing the accompanying pain, and for a crack or fissure of bone: let unwashed wool be taken and soaked in a decoction of oil and vinegar and applied to the place.</s> <s id="s2873">Now this plaster has no power of repair but it is outstanding for reducing effusion and dispersing pain.</s> <s id="s2874">Description of another plaster for the repair of a broken bone: let there be taken the leaves of the hard fig and of the wild poppy and both be beaten up together and a plaster made of them while still fresh and damp.</s> <s id="s2875">Description of another simple plaster used when a fracture is mending and you wish to disperse residual swellings: take one part each of marsh mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of vetch; pound it all and make a paste with decoction of wine, if the part be not inflamed.</s> <s id="s2876">But if it be inflamed make it up with water of fresh coriander or plain water, and use.</s> </p>
<p id="p463"><s id="s2877"> Description of another plaster stronger than the former for resolving, used if a hard swelling arises as the bone sets: let there be taken equal parts of each of marsh mallow roots, linseed, fenugreek, melilot, sweet marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; they should all be beaten up together and made into a paste with willow infusion or sweet water or wine, according to whether the part is inflamed or its heat has subsided.</s> </p>
<p id="p464"><s id="s2878"> Now Hippocrates in his book did not mention any application for the repair of a fractured part except a wax plaster made of wax and oil, nothing else.</s> <s id="s2879">He prescribed that it be of a consistency midway between thick and thin.</s> <s id="s2880">Galen, on the other hand, thought it good to apply to the broken limb, when it is mending, things which have a certain power of drying, with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, olibanum, and the sort of thing we have mentioned.</s> </p>
<p id="p465"><s id="s2881"> Description of a plaster valuable for debility and pain: let equal parts of each be taken of mughath, chickpease, minced human hair or birds' feathers, marsh mallows and salt; grind it up and pass through a sieve and make into a paste and use as a plaster.</s> <s id="s2882">As to the length of time the bandages should remain on before being loosened: you should keep an eye on the patient and if he suffers no pain or itching or any shifting of the broken bone, then they should not be loosened for a number of days; but if he experiences at the place a violent itching or a disturbing pain or swelling, then hasten to loosen them and make no delay; and remove the plaster.</s> <s id="s2883">Then you must take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge and dip it in tepid water and bathe the place until the itching subsides and the pain settles; then let the limb rest for an hour; then apply to it raw wool soaked in oil and vinegar or oil of roses, and bandage it on for one night until you are sure there is no effusion and the swelling of the limb has subsided and the pain has gone.</s> <s id="s2884">Then put the bandage on again gently, and a light plaster; do not bind it up as you did at the first but go gently with it until it heal.</s> <s id="s2885">If you see that the effusion, inflammation, pain, swelling, and other symptoms are totally gone, and you need to plaster and bandage it, then repeat just as you did at first.</s> <s id="s2886">But if none of these things that we have mentioned occur, then do not loosen it until after three, four, or five days or a week; sometimes it may be left up to twenty days, depending on how the limb appears to you, as we said, until the fracture be united and the flesh over it be near to joining.</s> <s id="s2887">Then bandage more tightly than before, and increase the heaviness of the patient's food as has been mentioned.</s> <s id="s2888">If you see the place of the fracture getting more dry and thin than it should, you may know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it; so foment it with tepid water each time you loosen it; do this every three days, and ease the bandaging somewhat.</s> <s id="s2889">This action makes nourishment flow to the limb and it will quickly heal.</s> </p>
<p id="p466"><s id="s2890"> What some ignorant bone-setters do is to break the bone again if at first the repair is not as it should be and has mended crookedly.</s> <s id="s2891">This operation of theirs is mistaken and dangerous; if it were right the Ancients would undoubtedly have spoken of it in their books and would have used it.</s> <s id="s2892">But I have not found a trace of it in a single one of them; and the right course is not to use it.</s> </p>

<p id="p467"><s id="s2893"> CHAPTER TWO.</s> <s id="s2894">On a fracture occurring in the head.</s> <s id="s2895">The kinds of fracture occurring in the head are many, of various forms and differing causes.</s> <s id="s2896">Some fractures are due to a sword-stroke which may cut right through the bone and reach the membrane beneath the bone, like an adze-cut in wood, for which reason this kind of cut is called 'ascial'.</s> <s id="s2897">Or the sword may cut through part of the bone, only slicing through the surface and not reaching the depth; this kind is called an absolute avulsion.</s> <s id="s2898">The wounds in these two fractures can be either big or small.</s> <s id="s2899">There are also some fractures accompanied by smashing or crushing; such as by a blow from a stone or by falling on a stone, and the like.</s> <s id="s2900">A fracture of this kind will be either penetrating, reaching the membrane beneath the bone; or superficial; the wound in these two fractures may be either big or small.</s> <s id="s2901">Then there is a type of fracture that is hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair, a thin crack; therefore this kind of fracture is called 'capillary'.</s> <s id="s2902">There is a fracture due to a fall or a blow from a stone and the like, making a dent in the surface of the bone and a hollow at the site as occurs in a bronze bowl when a blow falls on it and a portion of it is pushed in.</s> <s id="s2903">This mostly occurs in heads whose bones are soft, as those of children.</s> <s id="s2904">Any of these kinds of fracture may also have splinters, jagged or otherwise; we shall deal with the treatment of all these in their place.</s> <s id="s2905">All these kinds of fracture are diagnosed by laying them bare and investigating them with probes and removing all the lacerated tissues over them.</s> <s id="s2906">The 'capillary' kind is diagnosed by laying bare the bone, wiping it clean, and rubbing ink on it, when the fracture will appear black.</s> <s id="s2907">As to the treatment of the fracture: begin by paying attention to the patient's symptoms.</s> <s id="s2908">If you observe any symptom clearly indicating something dangerous, such as bilious vomit, convulsion, mental derangement, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, protrusion and inflammation of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then leave the patient alone and do not treat him; for in the majority of cases these symptoms undoubtedly indicate the approach of death.</s> <s id="s2909">But if you find symptoms that do not alarm you and you see hope of recovery for him, then begin treatment as follows.</s> <s id="s2910">If he be brought to you immediately after his injury and it be the season of winter, you should try to remove the bone, at all events before the fourteenth day.</s> <s id="s2911">If it be summer you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the covering membrane beneath the bone and over the brain be infected, and before the above-mentioned symptoms occur.</s> <s id="s2912">If the fracture has already reached the cerebral membrane with fragmentation of the bone and depression, then you must cut out the splintered and broken part as I shall now describe to you.</s> <s id="s2913">Shave the head of the injured patient and lay the bone bare in any way you can, following the course of the injury and in the manner least grievous to the injured man.</s> <s id="s2914">If, when you lay the bone bare, you encounter a haemorrhage or abscess, meet the case with suitable remedies; that is, pack the place with dressings soaked in wine and oil of roses, and cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and you are safe from haemorrhage; then begin the trepanning and removal of the bone.</s> <s id="s2915">This may be done in one of two ways.</s> <s id="s2916">One way is to cut the bone with a fine-bladed chisel, this being the figure of it.</s> <s id="s2917">Then after this one employ another chisel, a little broader.</s> <s id="s2918">It is figured here.</s> <s id="s2919">Then use yet another chisel still broader than the second.</s> <s id="s2920">You should have by you a number of different chisels, some broader than others and some shorter than others; their tips should be exquisitely sharp; and they should be made of Indian iron or best steel.</s> <s id="s2921">Let the strokes upon the chisel be gentle lest the head be shocked or injured.</s> <s id="s2922">If the bone be strong and hard you should, before you use the chisel, make perforations round about it with drills called 'non-sinking' drills.</s> <s id="s2923">Their name of non-sinking drills is due to their not piercing the cranial bone through to what is beneath, because the drill has a circular margin beneath its sharp head like a small collar or wheel, that prevents it from sinking in and going beyond the thickness of the bone.</s> </p>
<p id="p468"><s id="s2924"> You must obtain a large number of these drills each of which will suit a certain thickness of bone; so that for each skull you have a drill whose pointed extremity is of a length to suit the thickness of that skull.</s> <s id="s2925">Here are figured three kinds of drill, large, medium, and small.</s> <s id="s2926">As to the manner of perforation round the fractured bone, you apply the drill to the bone and revolve it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced, then you transfer the drill to another place, making the distance between the perforations about the thickness of a probe.</s> <s id="s2927">Then with the chisels cut out the bone between the perforations, using the utmost delicacy, as we have said.</s> <s id="s2928">Then take out the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument you have ready for the purpose, such as forceps or fine tongs.</s> <s id="s2929">You will have to observe the utmost caution that neither drill nor chisel touch any part of the membrane.</s> <s id="s2930">When you have cut the bone circularly, free from the membrane if adherent to it, and have removed it, then you will have to scrape away and smooth out all the roughness in the remaining bone with another instrument, resembling a chisel, except that it must be finer and slenderer than any of them.</s> <s id="s2931">If there are any little bits or spicules of bone left, pick them out with whatever instrument you can, gently; and then treat the wound with dressings and ointments as we shall describe.</s> <s id="s2932">The other way of operating is altogether easy and free from danger; Galen mentioned it and greatly praised it; these are his words: You should begin by laying bare that part of the bone where the fracture is severest and most obvious; when you have done so, place under it the tip of this lenticular chisel figured here.</s> <s id="s2933">The lenticular part of it should be smooth and not for cutting, the sharp part of it being on both sides longitudinally, as you see; so that the lenticular part is resting upon the meninges while the cutting surface is on the bone.</s> <s id="s2934">Then with a small hammer strike the tool on one side until you gently cut through the bone in a circle, in the confident knowledge that nothing untoward can happen to the membrane even though the operator be the most ignorant and cowardly of men; yes, even if he be sleepy.</s> <s id="s2935">If any membrane stick to any part of the bone, strip it off with the lenticular tip of the chisel and free it gently from it, for it will come away without harm or danger.</s> <s id="s2936">If it be a fracture of the bone not reaching to the meninges, only the surface of the bone being separated, and there remain some roughness and fine splinters, you should smooth down the roughness and remove the splinters with fine scrapers, of which you should have a number, of varying sizes so that you can use the one best fitted and most suitable, in the light of what is suggested by your operative method and the broken bone itself and its shape.</s> <s id="s2937">When you smooth the bone you must first use the broadest of the scrapers and then a finer one, and so on until you come to use the finest and slenderest of all.</s> </p>
<p id="p469"><s id="s2938"> As to the rest, the little capillary fractures and fine fissures, you will have to apply to each of them that treatment that will bring about a perfect repair.</s> <s id="s2939">This is obvious to anyone who has the least practice in this art and is acquainted with what we have written in explanation of the big fractures.</s> <s id="s2940">If the meninges are left bare when you remove the bone, you should take a linen dressing measured to the wound, soak it in oil of roses, and apply it to the opening of the wound; then take another dressing, folded in two or three, soak it in wine and oil of roses and apply it over the first with the utmost gentleness so as not to press upon the meninges; then employ a broad bandage on top, but tighten it only enough to keep the wound covered.</s> <s id="s2941">Leave it with this dressing on for a day or two until you are sure there is no abscess; then loosen it and apply desiccant remedies such as lily roots, vetch-flour, powdered frankincense, birthwort, and the like.</s> <s id="s2942">The method is that you make a powder of these drugs and sprinkle it, dry as it is, upon the wound; in short, in these cases use drugs whose nature is cleansing and not irritating.</s> <s id="s2943">In this be most diligent, that the wound, while you are treating it, be clean; nor let there be any dirty vestiges of ointment in it or any filth; and let no pus collect in it; for when pus collects on the meninges it corrupts them and renders them necrotic, which causes great harm to the patient.</s> <s id="s2944">Sometimes the surface meninges go black when the bone is removed, especially when the treatment of them is neglected; so observe, and if the patient exhibit any of the symptoms that we have mentioned you may know that he is undoubtedly doomed.</s> <s id="s2945">But if the blackness be due to some medicament applied to it, which has the power to produce blackness of that kind, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of oil of roses, beat them well up together, spread on a cloth and apply it to the membrane; then treat as necessary until cured.</s> </p>

<p id="p521"><s id="s3295"> You should know that there are three ways in which the humerus may be dislocated.</s> <s id="s3296">One is a dislocation down into the axilla, another is a dislocation toward the breast; it may also be dislocated upward, which is rare.</s> <s id="s3297">It is not dislocated backward, because of the scapula; nor is it dislocated forward, on account of the tendons.</s> <s id="s3298">Mostly it is dislocated and displaced down into the axilla, and particularly in those of a spare build; in such it quickly comes out and quickly goes back.</s> <s id="s3299">But in those of a fleshy build it is the opposite; it comes out with difficulty and goes back with difficulty.</s> <s id="s3300">Sometimes a man suffers a blow or a fall, so that the upper arm swells up with an effusion, whence he forms the opinion that there is a dislocation.</s> <s id="s3301">So you must examine it to make sure of it and then proceed to treat it.</s> <s id="s3302">A dislocation down into the axilla may be diagnosed by comparing the sound and the dislocated humerus; for you will find an obvious difference between them; you will find a hollow at the head of the humerus, and in the axilla the head of the humerus may be palpated like an egg, and the patient is unable to lift his hand to his ear, and full movements are restricted.</s> <s id="s3303">Similarly if it is displaced toward the breast or upward you will find it obvious to the touch and not hidden.</s> <s id="s3304">The reduction of this dislocation will be quite simple if it be only recent or the patient be a child.</s> <s id="s3305">To reduce it, his hand should be lifted up by an assistant, then you should put both your thumbs under his axilla and lift the joint up powerfully into its place, while the assistant lifts and stretches his hand upward; then he puts it down and the dislocation will at once go back.</s> <s id="s3306">If it is not reduced by the means we have stated, being a dislocation of many days' standing, the patient should take a hot bath and use relaxing and softening fomentations, such as decoction of marsh mallow root and fenugreek and melilot.</s> <s id="s3307">Then the patient should lie on his back and you put under his axilla a ball of wool of moderately hard consistency.</s> <s id="s3308">Then the doctor should put his heel on the ball and grasp the patient's hand and draw it downward, while pushing the ball with his foot, and it will straightway be reduced.</s> <s id="s3309">Or, if you prefer, reduce it in this way: get a man taller than the patient to stand on one side and pass his shoulder under the patient's axilla and lift it up until the patient is suspended in mid-air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards his lower abdomen (if the patient is light it will be necessary to hang a weight from him); then the dislocation will straightway be reduced.</s> </p>
<p id="p522"><s id="s3310"> It is also reduced by another method: that is, to fix in.</s> <s id="s3311">the ground a long spar of wood; its head should be of a round shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither massive nor slender; then after a soft pad has been put on the head of the spar it should be placed under the axilla of the patient, who should be standing alongside the spar; then let his hand be drawn downward on one side and his body on the other, powerfully.</s> <s id="s3312">Then the joint will immediately return to its place.</s> </p>
<p id="p523"><s id="s3313"> If it proves difficult to reduce it by any of the means we have stated, employ this treatment: take a wooden spar some two cubits in length, two fingers thick, and four wide; it should have a round head to facilitate its introduction into the hollow of the axilla; of this shape.</s> <s id="s3314">Then you bind on the round head soft rags so that the wood will not hurt the patient.</s> <s id="s3315">Then it is placed under the patient's axilla, and his whole hand and arm are stretched down over the spar, which is to be bound down to the upper arm, the forearm, and the tip of the hand.</s> <s id="s3316">Then let the arm be placed cross-wise over the rung of a ladder and the hand stretched downward, and let the rest of the body hang down on the other side; then the joint will very quickly go back.</s> <s id="s3317">Once it has gone back properly, in whatever way is possible, there should be put under the axilla a ball of wool of moderate size; then apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust with olibanum and egg-white, all round the shoulder.</s> <s id="s3318">Then firmly bandage the ball under the axilla and carry the bandaging round over the plaster.</s> <s id="s3319">Sling his hand from his neck, then let him be left without moving his hand for a week.</s> <s id="s3320">The patient's diet should be light until the limb gets strong, for that will hasten the cure.</s> <s id="s3321">After five or seven days it can be unfastened and he can make trial of its movement; if it is firm and not slack then it is healed.</s> </p>
<p id="p524"><s id="s3322"> If the joint is frequently dislocated, on account of a humidity arising in it or some other cause, then use should be made of the cautery with three prongs spoken of earlier, in the book on cauterizations.</s> <s id="s3323">If you do all this and loosen the bandaging after a week and the joint is still not firm, and you repeatedly plaster it and bandage it, and it is still loose and comes down and dislocates and you are unable to raise it up, then you may know that the tendons at the head of the humerus are either cut through or stretched or loosened; in which case you may know that the joint will never stay firm in its place.</s> <s id="s3324">As to the dislocation toward the chest and breast, and posteriorly, the reduction of this is done by thrusting and extension with both hands until it goes back.</s> <s id="s3325">And apply the usual bandaging and treatment until it is healed.</s> <s id="s3326">If, after it has healed, a callosity arises in it, and it is slow in movement, the patient should take frequent hot baths until that callosity is softened and the member returns to its original condition.</s> </p>

<p id="p526"><s id="s3329"> The elbow is with difficulty dislocated and with difficulty put back.</s> <s id="s3330">Now dislocation may be in all directions, and particularly forward and backward.</s> <s id="s3331">Whatever way it is dislocated it will not be concealed from you, because it is both visible and palpable, and whenever you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one it is quite openly and plainly manifested; for the elbow joint is hollow and the patient cannot flex the forearm back or touch his shoulder with it.</s> <s id="s3332">You must hasten and reduce the dislocation as rapidly as possible before an abscess occur.</s> <s id="s3333">For if an abscess occur the reduction of it is difficult and maybe it will never be healed; especially when it is a posterior dislocation, for this is the worst and most painful of all the kinds of dislocation, and often it is fatal.</s> <s id="s3334">Now when it is one of those that can be reduced, the way to reduce it is for an assistant to perform a two-handed extension of the patient's hand, the patient's forearm being opened out, while the doctor's hands are above and below the elbow joint and he thrusts the joint with both thumbs together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.</s> <s id="s3335">If it be an anterior dislocation, it may go back if the hand is bent sharply back until it strikes its own shoulder with the root of the palm.</s> </p>
<p id="p527"><s id="s3336"> If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, apply very strong and powerful extension.</s> <s id="s3337">For this, let two assistants pull on the arm while two other assistants hold the patient against the extension.</s> <s id="s3338">Then the arm should be rotated in all directions after the limb has been wrapped in a long folded cloth or a broad wrapper.</s> <s id="s3339">When the doctor begins manipulating the joint he should anoint his hands with oil so as to assist, by its lubrication, the movement of the joint; then he should thrust the joint powerfully until it goes back.</s> <s id="s3340">After its reduction he should apply to it a plaster having some styptic and absorbent qualities, with egg-white; and put on a firm bandage and suspend the patient's arm from his neck and leave it for some days.</s> <s id="s3341">Then undo it; and if the joint remains fixed in its place, then untie the bandaging and leave it.</s> <s id="s3342">If you see that the joint is not thoroughly firm, replace the plaster and bandaging and leave it for a few more days until it is firm; then untie it.</s> <s id="s3343">If, after the reduction and unbandaging of the joint, it becomes stiff and is difficult to move, soften it in the bath and apply gentle friction and massage until it is softened, or apply to the joint the tail of a fat-tailed sheep; bind it on and leave it on for a day and a night; then remove it and send him to the bath, and when he sweats apply moderate friction to the joint; then replace the tail and again and again, alternating with the bath, until the joint softens.</s> <s id="s3344">If you prefer, apply to it, and bandage on, fresh cow-dung lightened with butter.</s> <s id="s3345">Do this a number of times and it will soften and return it to its original state.</s> </p>

<p id="p529"><s id="s3348"> The carpus of the hand is often dislocated.</s> <s id="s3349">Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.</s> <s id="s3350">The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.</s> <s id="s3351">But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself.</s> <s id="s3352">If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be.</s> <s id="s3353">Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed.</s> <s id="s3354">But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised.</s> <s id="s3355">In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all.</s> <s id="s3356">When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.</s> <s id="s3357">If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.</s> </p>

<p id="p533"><s id="s3379"> I say then, that in a curvature occurring forward there is no technique or cure for it.</s> <s id="s3380">And likewise in a curvature laterally.</s> <s id="s3381">The only curvature that can be treated is that of the dorsal spine exclusively, by the means I now describe.</s> <s id="s3382">The patient should be stretched prone upon a level bench near a wall, and a soft palliasse should be spread under him so that his chest may not be hurt.</s> <s id="s3383">Then put a straight spar, set in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench where his head is, and another spar where his feet are at the other end of the bench.</s> <s id="s3384">Let an assistant hold this spar, which is not to be firmly fixed in the hole, while another assistant holds the other in the same way.</s> <s id="s3385">Then wind round the patient's chest and beneath his axillae a soft strong wrapper, and stretch one end of the wrapper to the spar at his head, and tie it to it.</s> <s id="s3386">Then bind other wrappers: over his hips, his knees, and by both tendons of Achilles; then bring the wrappers together and tie them to the other spar at his feet.</s> <s id="s3387">Then each assistant extends the spar with the tie towards himself; the two spars will not shift from their places in which they are planted, but, as we have said, they are not to be fixed.</s> <s id="s3388">Meanwhile the doctor is to press hard with both his palms upon the spine until it goes back; or he may place a board upon it and apply pressure to the board with his feet until it goes back.</s> <s id="s3389">But if it does not go back under this treatment then let a board be taken, about three cubits long, and let a place be hollowed out in the wall, which, as we said, should be near the patient, into which you put the end of the board; then place the mid-point of the board upon the hump, and he—the doctor—should place both his feet on the other end and strongly thrust upon the spine until it is forced back into position.</s> </p>
<p id="p534"><s id="s3390"> If you wish you may operate by means of a winch turned by hand; thus: you fix in the ground at the head of the patient, at one end of the bench, two wooden spars each one cubit long; and the same at the lower end, at his feet; there should be the distance of a span between the spars (of each pair).</s> <s id="s3391">In each spar there should be a hole in which the shaft may run, and each spar should be firmly fixed in the ground so as not to move at all.</s> <s id="s3392">Then you introduce a round piece of wood, the shaft on which the rope is wound, into the two openings of the two wooden spars.</s> <s id="s3393">At one end of each shaft is a hole into which is firmly fixed a piece of wood a span long by which it is wound.</s> <s id="s3394">Likewise with the other two spars.</s> <s id="s3395">Then bind the wrapper that you have bound round his chest to the shaft at the patient's head, and those bound round his legs to the shaft at his feet.</s> <s id="s3396">Then have an assistant standing at each shaft to turn with his hand the handle by which the shaft is revolved, while the doctor straightens out the curvature in the way we have described.</s> <s id="s3397">This is the figure of the winch, the bench and the patient.</s> </p>

<p id="p536"><s id="s3402"> CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE.</s> <s id="s3403">On the treatment of a dislocated hip.</s> </p>
<p id="p537"><s id="s3404"> You should know that a complete dislocation alone is sustained by the hip and shoulder joints; they do not sustain the lesser displacements, with concavity, as do the other joints.</s> <s id="s3405">Now the hip joint is dislocated in four directions, interior, exterior, posterior, and anterior.</s> <s id="s3406">Most commonly it is dislocated interiorly; and rarely is it dislocated anteriorly or posteriorly.</s> <s id="s3407">The indication of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the patient's sound leg with the injured leg it will be longer and the knee will be prominent as compared with that of the sound leg; nor will it be possible for the patient to flex the foot back on the groin; and there will be an obvious swelling near the groin because the head of the femur has moved there.</s> <s id="s3408">The sign of the occurrence of an external dislocation: the symptoms will be the exact contrary to these.</s> <s id="s3409">The sign of an anterior dislocation is that the patient can stretch his leg out fully but cannot flex it without feeling pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk he will be unable to walk forward; and he has retention of the urine and his groin swells, and in walking he hobbles upon his heel.</s> <s id="s3410">The sign of a posterior dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he flex it before flexing the hip; also the leg will be shorter than the other, the groin will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be evident at the lumbar region.</s> </p>
<p id="p538"><s id="s3411"> As to the reduction of the various forms of this dislocation, you must examine the case and if it be an old dislocation which the patient has suffered from for a long time and the reduction of which has not been contrived and which remains as it was, there is no treatment for it at all, nor should any be attempted.</s> <s id="s3412">But in that case whose dislocation is recent, whichever of the four kinds of dislocation it be, hasten to rotate the joint and extend it internally and externally and move it to the right and the left; for often it will return and no further treatment will be needed.</s> <s id="s3413">But if it does not go back thus, you must have ready a sturdy and powerful assistant to extend the leg from below, either with both his hands or with a wrapper bound upon the leg above the knee; while another assistant pulls from above by putting his hands under the patient's axillae; then you should bind a soft wrapper upon the root of the thigh, with a third assistant to hold the end of the bandage.</s> <s id="s3414">Then extension should be made either anteriorly from the direction of the groin to the direction of the clavicle, or posteriorly toward the dorsal spine.</s> <s id="s3415">Let them all make their extension simultaneously so the patient is lifted up bodily and remains suspended.</s> <s id="s3416">This kind of extension is common to all four kinds of dislocation.</s> <s id="s3417">If the dislocation goes back by the way we have said, good.</s> <s id="s3418">Otherwise, each kind must have the special treatment I shall describe.</s> </p>
<p id="p539"><s id="s3419"> When it is an internal dislocation then the special reduction is for the patient to lie upon his sound side; then apply a wrapper to the root of the hip in the space between the head of the femur and the part below the groin; then carry the bandage upward from the groin toward the upper part of the body, in the direction of the clavicle.</s> <s id="s3420">Then another powerful and sturdy assistant is to take hold of his arms while the thick part of the afflicted thigh is clasped and strongly extended outward; then it will return to its place.</s> <s id="s3421">This kind of treatment is easier than the others for the reduction of this limb.</s> <s id="s3422">But if you find it refractory and it does not answer to this method of treatment, then the patient's two feet will have to be bound together with a strong soft bandage round his two ankles and his two knees.</s> <s id="s3423">The distance from each to the next should be four fingers, and the injured leg should be stretched two fingers beyond the other.</s> <s id="s3424">Then the patient is to reach upward and grasp any beam that may be in the house; he should be about two cubits from the floor.</s> <s id="s3425">Then tell a powerful servant to clasp the head of the hip and another servant to hang from the patient; and the other servant, the one who is clasping the hip, should thrust powerfully; then the hip will speedily go back.</s> </p>
<p id="p540"><s id="s3426"> The special method of reduction in the case of an external dislocation: it will be necessary for the patient to be lying on a bench after the manner described for the one with a curvature of the spine; but wrappers are to be tied only on the injured leg and the chest.</s> <s id="s3427">Then the two spars are to be set in position, one at his feet and another at his head; and have an additional spar firmly fixed in the middle of the bench and wrapped in soft cloth so as not to injure the patient; this spar is to be between his thighs so that he will not be dragged down during extension.</s> <s id="s3428">Then each assistant is to pull in his own direction while the doctor sets the hip with his hands.</s> <s id="s3429">And if it goes back, good.</s> <s id="s3430">But if not, place the board upon it and put pressure upon it just as we prescribed for curvature, except that the patient will have to lie upon his sound side.</s> </p>
<p id="p541"><s id="s3431"> When it is an anterior dislocation, extension will have to be applied forcefully to the patient's leg, on the bench, exactly as described; the doctor should place the palm of his right hand upon the injured groin and then apply pressure with the other hand, directing the pressure so as to make extension downward toward the knee.</s> </p>
<p id="p542"><s id="s3432"> If it is a posterior dislocation the patient must not be raised above the ground and extended downward; rather must he be placed upon something hard, in the manner that we prescribed for an external displacement of the hip: he is to lie prone on the bench with the bands tied as we said before.</s> <s id="s3433">It will also be necessary to apply pressure with the board to the site to which the joint has been displaced.</s> <s id="s3434">When the proper reduction of the joint is completed—the signs of reduction will be plain to you; namely, that you extend both the patient's legs, and when you see that both legs are of equal length and the patient can draw up and stretch out the leg without difficulty, then you may know that the limb has gone back as it should—then bring both thighs together, apply the plaster and bind with a sash so that the hip does not move in any direction; and the patient is to keep perfectly quiet for three or four days.</s> <s id="s3435">Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other.</s> <s id="s3436">If you see that they are both the same size you may know that the dislocation is cured and you can allow the patient to walk freely.</s> <s id="s3437">But if you see any slackening then repeat: replaster and rebandage as you did at first, and leave for another three days.</s> <s id="s3438">Then unfasten.</s> <s id="s3439">He should be cautious about walking on it for some days, until it is thoroughly strong, God willing.</s> </p>

<p id="p545"><s id="s3451"> CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE.</s> <s id="s3452">On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.</s> <s id="s3453">The ankle is sometimes slightly displaced, sometimes fully dislocated, the dislocation being either internal or external.</s> <s id="s3454">The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen, and projecting on the side to which it is dislocated.</s> <s id="s3455">As to the treatment of its displacement, the reduction of it is easy: if it is gently extended with the hands and straightened, it will go back.</s> <s id="s3456">As to treatment when it is dislocated completely, you should make the patient sit upright with a strong and sturdy assistant holding him about the middle from behind.</s> <s id="s3457">Then hold the dorsum of the foot with your right hand, and with the left grasp the foot from below about the heel.</s> <s id="s3458">Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand, then with the left, twice.</s> <s id="s3459">Then extend it with the left hand and thrust the metatarsus with the right hand without violence toward the leg.</s> <s id="s3460">Do this as we have described, twice.</s> <s id="s3461">Then thrust the metatarsus toward the leg a third time while exerting traction at the heel.</s> <s id="s3462">If it goes back in one or two attempts thus, and you see the foot is straightened, well and good.</s> <s id="s3463">If not, repeat the operation and it will go back.</s> <s id="s3464">If you find it impossible to reduce it by what we have said, make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly fix in the ground between his thighs a stake wrapped in material so as not to hurt him.</s> <s id="s3465">Then an assistant should grasp his thigh and another assistant should extend the foot, either manually or with a cord tied round the narrow part of it; the assistants should pull one against another, with the stake upright between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body will not be dragged down with the extension.</s> <s id="s3466">Then the doctor should straighten out the dislocation with both hands, while another assistant holds down the sound leg; then the dislocation will speedily go back.</s> <s id="s3467">Then when the dislocation is reduced and the soundness of the reduction is manifested to you, apply a plaster and packing, bandage firmly and bind the foot downwards.</s> <s id="s3468">You will have to be careful of the tendon above the ankle at the back, not to bandage tightly over it so as to injure it.</s> <s id="s3469">Then leave him for two or three days; and if the binding works loose, tighten it up.</s> <s id="s3470">Then on the third or fourth day loosen it, but the patient is to abstain from walking for forty days, for if he tries to walk before this lapse of time you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not collapse and corruption set in and thereafter be incurable.</s> <s id="s3471">If an abscess occur you must allay it by the application of such dressings and embrocations as we have already described more than once, until it is gone.</s> </p>

<p id="p548"><s id="s3480"> When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel.</s> <s id="s3481">Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold.</s> <s id="s3482">To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.</s> <s id="s3483">If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.</s> <s id="s3484">If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.</s> <s id="s3485">Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before.</s> <s id="s3486">For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.</s> </p>
