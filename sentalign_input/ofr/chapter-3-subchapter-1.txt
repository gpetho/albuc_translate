It is therefore necessary that we state in the prologue of this book the main points of the discussion and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or sprain or bruise happens to someone, you must hasten to treat the patient on both sides, unless something prevents you entirely, such as weakness of the body, or infancy, or old age; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold; and prescribe cold things, that is to say cold broths, and the meat of birds and kid, and do not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overfill with foods that fill the veins with blood, as long as you have no fear of a hot abscess, or of spreading of matter in the limb; then the patient should return to his former diet that he was used to.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that make for substantial nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow's tripe, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things.
For with such nourishment the fracture heals better and faster.
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or knit well according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor can those who are too tender, such as the bones of small children; but it doesn't matter, replace the broken bone with a large splint which holds and joins the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not stop its work, and for this reason it must be nourished with rich foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the chest, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another obliquely, like the cut of a quill for writing.
And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And each type has its own technique, and its own specific instrument for restoration, according to what comes to mind in its place; and the fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and is clearly apparent by default, and sounds when pressed by the hand; and when there is no twisting nor sound when touched, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture; but there can indeed be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. 
So you should not move it with your hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then bind it carefully immediately.
And know that for the fracture that goes across, and the two parts are separated, you must immediately put them back in place evenly, before a hot abscess develops there; and if a hot abscess develops, leave it for a few days, until the abscess subsides; then set it as evenly as you can easily and wisely, and know that its restoration is easier than the restoration of one where there are fragments; then bind it, as is appropriate below.
And if there are broken pieces in the bone, stretch it from both sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with a cord and your hand; and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, bring the pieces back into their place as best you can, and be careful that your work does not cause injury or pain to the patient; and join the two ends of the bones well according to the best form.
And feel it carefully with your hand if it seems to you that it is not right: then straighten it gently, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do whose work causes a hot abscess and contraction of the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is set, warn the patient carefully not to move it, neither waking nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way; and make sure that the limb is so secure that he feels no pain.
For when he feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be placed in such a position that he feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, so that no crookedness occurs when it is healed; and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs vary in smallness and size and shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and the like: these should be wrapped with bandages of soft and fine linen; and those that are large, such as the thigh and leg: these should be wrapped with a wide and strong bandage, for the wide bandage embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it evenly on all sides, so that there is no blemish; then tie around it light padding, three or four turns depending on the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole bandage, then go above the break and tighten less, further away from the break; and loosen the bandage little by little, until you cover a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the broken area; then go back to the part below the break, and tighten moderately, not too tight nor too loose, as we said in the first bandage above; then place between the bandages linen padding or cloths, until it is all even, then tie a bandage over it all, and then place your well-made splints on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, apply something soothing and warm for the abscess, and which removes the swelling, and leave it like this for a few days; then tighten your splints, and let them be half the width of a large, wisely cut dogwood branch, or of wood from which arrow shafts are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure: 
but the splint that is placed over the break must be a little thicker and wider than the others; and be as long as is necessary for the limb, whether small or large; then tighten over the splints as you did with the first bandage, then tie a thread over it appropriately, as in the first bandage over the break; tighter above, gradually less so; and the threads must be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen; for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, because the bandage cannot be even if it is too tight, and there should not be less than a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, place linen padding or carded wool underneath them so that he is not injured.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the skin is broken, I will describe the treatment hereafter.
And know that you should not tighten all broken limbs with splints on the first day.
For when the limb is large, splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more depending on your certainty of a hot abscess occurring; and here is the method for ancient plasters to restore fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take the flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of making the plaster that restores fractures of many kinds, and especially for women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster restoring fracture, dislocation, and sprain: take three units of yellow sweet clover, labdanum, elecampane, and asafetida, and gum arabic, and galbanum, ten units each; myrrh and aloe, five units each; mastic nine units; and make a powder, and mix them with plenty of eggs; if the person's complexion is hot, use this plaster, because it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is beneficial for many people.
Another kind of plaster that is good for sprains: take galbanum and marshmallow, ten units each; myrrh and aloe, nine units each; acacia six units; Armenian bole ten units, and grind well, and mix with water or plenty of eggs, and administer it.
Another kind of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and outgrowth of bone, and fractures: take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the area.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and effectively removes pain.
Another kind of plaster that restores broken bones: take dried fig leaves, and ground ivy leaves, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another kind of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and to reduce the remains of the abscess.
Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each; and grind them, and mix with wine, and if the limb is heated, mix it with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.
Another kind of plaster, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes during the restoration of the limb.
Take marshmallow roots, and flax seed, pomegranate rind, sweet clover, and elderflower, and violet and chamomile flowers, equal parts of all; and grind them, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on the fractured limb to restore it anything but a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else more, and says that it should be medium, neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen thinks that one should put on the broken limb, to restore it, slightly warm, dry things, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: take mastic and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow root, and salt in equal measure, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then unbind it a little later, and take care if the patient feels any pain, or if the bone has moved from its place; if not, do not unbind it for several days. And if pain comes to the area, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately; and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and wash the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then apply dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it overnight, until you are sure of a warm abscess; and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed, then begin the bandaging again gently, and a little plaster, and do not tighten it as much as before; and continue gently until it is healed.
And if you see that the warm abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need plaster and bandages, then start again, as you did the first time, similarly.
And if none of what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it until after three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what is observed, until the break dries, and the joining of the flesh approaches; then tighten it more than before, and increase his food, as I have said before; and if you see the area drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot reach it; then moisten it with warm tepid water, every time you unbind it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little; by this work, then, nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly corrects what foolish physicians do, who set the limb crookedly: this is bad, and it is also dangerous work, and I see nothing else to do but to leave it and work correctly.
