O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, by completing it I have reached its end, and through its expositions and declarations, it seems to me that I have fulfilled it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the surgical operation with my hands.
Because the surgical operation is widely neglected in our region and our time, the science of it is greatly endangered, and its practice is lost; and there remain only some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which have misled many and led to error and hesitation, so that understanding of it is obscured and its strength and art are diminished.
And it seems to me that I will revitalize it [the surgical operation] through the organization of this treatise, in accordance with the method of exposition, declaration, and summarization; and so that it will be made clear through the descriptions of cautery instruments and other tools of the craft, both by adding explanations and by preparing them [the tools], which is necessary.
However, the reason why a skilled artisan with his hands is not easily found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be practiced in the science of anatomy, which includes knowledge of the locations and forms of the body's parts, their connections, and separations;  and must have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and tendons, their numbers and courses; and of the pulsating and still veins, and the locations of their exits.
And therefore Hippocrates said that with a name it is much, but in the work little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy, cannot be certain of not falling into an error that will cause people to die, as I have seen many such cases. For some are trained in this science but abandon it without experience or knowledge.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled surgeon inadvertently open a scrophulous abscess on a woman's neck, and severed some arteries in her neck so that a great deal of blood flowed, causing the woman to die in his hands.
And I saw another surgeon who claimed to have removed a stone from a man who had suffered from this affliction for a long time, and the stone was large.  He went to the man and removed the stone, taking some of the bladder tissue with it, and the man died on the third day.
And I, having already tried to stop it, saw that because of the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I knew beforehand that he would die.
And I saw another surgeon who received payment from a duke in our land for surgery, and he went to a blackguard who had a fractured thigh; but because of the surgeon's ignorance, he treated the fracture, placing the wound over pads and splints with excessive tightness, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And he, according to his desires, set it, rejoined it, and left it for a few days, and ordered that the ligament be released.  And it remained like that until the thigh and foot became abscessed and succumbed to ruin.
And I was called to him, and proceeded to release the ligament, and thus tranquility and relief from his pain were achieved.
However, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, so I could not stop it, and the corruption continued in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it ulcerated for several days, until its malice was magnified with the patient's suffering.
Since cancer is pure melancholy humor, it should not be treated with a total iron cauterization but rather on a limb where it is sufficient to remove the disease.
Therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical procedure be divided into two parts: one, the operation that is associated with health, and the other, the work which carries peril in the most important situations.
And I have already shown this in every part of this book where there is an operation that includes error and fear.  Therefore, it is necessary for you to watch this and leave that behind, so the pages may not find a way to speak and to disgrace you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and with God's protection, and your patients with skill and firmness.
And use the best path, through God's grace, leading to health and praiseworthy success, and leave behind the terrible illnesses of difficult cure, and remove from your tools that which makes you fear, so that your work in your faith and your name will not be wasted: for more remains for your glory, and higher in the world and behind your sanctity.
Gualia already said in some of his teachings: Do not treat a serious illness, lest you be called bad doctors".
And I have already divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter, ordered from head to foot, describes the types of instruments and cautery irons, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and piercing, cupping, poultices, the removal of arrows and similar objects, is entirely about the various types of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoring and dislocating, and on treating twists and similar injuries;  ordered from head to foot, and concerning the types of instruments.
It is necessary that I describe the benefits and harms of this cauterization, and in which temperament it is forbidden.
Therefore, I say that the discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization is long, detailed, scientifically subtle, and secretly hidden; and many learned individuals have already spoken about it, and disagreed, and it suffices for me to take a little from their discussions, fearing to prolong this.
And therefore I say that cauterization is beneficial to all temperaments universally, whether with matter or without matter, except for two temperaments, which are hot temperaments without matter.
In the hot and dry temperament with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cauterization is beneficial to it, and others say the contrary, that cauterization is not suitable for an illness that is due to heat and dryness, since the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inappropriate for a hot and dry illness to be treated with something that is also hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite argue that cauterization is beneficial in all hot and dry illnesses that affect the body, because when you compare the body's moisture to the nature of fire, you find the body to be cold.
And I say, based on this argument, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, this should not be taken up by one who is not experienced and practiced in the chapter on cauterization through prior exercises, and who has not known the diversity of human temperaments and the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the time-frame of these illnesses.
But in other temperaments, you have no fear, and especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all physicians have agreed upon these, and are not divided on the use of cauterization in them.
And know, children, that the secret of healing through cauterization with fire, and its effectiveness,  is in contrast to cauterization with medicinal burning agents, because fire is simple, its action only affecting the member being cauterized and not harming the adjacent member, except perhaps with little harm.
But the action of medicinal burning agents reaches the members further away, and easily brings illness of difficult healing to the afflicted member and easily causes pain.
But fire, because of its superior nature and beneficial substance, does not do this, but rather it simply burns. And this is known to us through experience and a long study of the art, concerning the truth of the causes; therefore, I am excused from the length of this speech.  And if it were not that this is not found in my book on this subject, concerning the hidden secrets of fire, and the nature of its operation on the body and its expulsion of illness, with a philosophical demonstration, which would be beneficial to your understanding.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time when it is best to perform cauterization, and they consider spring the best time.
And I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times, because the harm caused by the passing of time is overshadowed by the benefit derived from the cauterization, and especially if the cauterization is for severe, sudden pains or necessary ones, which cannot tolerate delay because the feared harm may be greater than the minor harm caused by time passing.
And this is not considered by you, children, or by foolish doctors, because it is understood that the illness cured by cauterization does not have a fixed time for treatment, and they disregard that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they imagine, for cauterization is not simply a place for medicine, but rather an alteration of the constitution, drying out the moisture which is the cause of the pain.
However, cauterization is superior to other medicine because of its power, efficacy, and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that their illness may return at some time, according to the patient's constitution, the location of their illness, the body's disposition, and the accumulation of superfluities within them, as well as what they have ingested in food and similar matters. However, if the illness for which cauterization is administered is a minor one, affecting only a small area with little superfluity and moisture, like a toothache or similar situations, then it's possible the pain will not return, but this happens in small cases.
And the common saying is that cauterization is the final remedy in medicine, and that is a true statement, not as they understand it, for they believe there is no cure that is as effective as cauterization, or with any other means.
And the truth is the opposite; the idea that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is only true when administering treatments for certain illnesses, and those treatments aren't effective.  It is only at the end, as a final measure, that cauterization is applied, and then it can be effective. Therefore, the statement that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, is not true according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said this only because of the purity and superior substance of gold.
And they said that the location of the cauterization doesn't matter, but that's not entirely true, for I have proven it and found that this is only true in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with gold is better than with iron as they say; however, when you cauterize with gold, it's not entirely clear to you, because it melts according to the amount you want, due to the gold's hardness, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you add heat to it, the gold melts, and the craftsman loses some shavings in the process.
Therefore, cauterization with iron is done more easily and more directly to achieve the desired result.
And I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections, and I have ordered them from head to foot, so that the seeker can find what they want.
The first chapter.
This cauterization addresses dampness and coldness affecting the brain, which has two causes:  a copious and numerous rheumatic flux, called catarrh, flowing from the head to the eye and ear regions, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat problems, and generally all ailments stemming from coldness, such as paralysis, stroke, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is as follows:  first, order the patient to be purged with laxative medicine for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and usual response.
Then command him to shave his head, and afterward, place him seated between your hands on a smooth bench and have him place his hands on his feet.
And then, place the blade of your palm near the bridge of his nose, between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark that spot with a tent, and then apply the olive cautery, whose form is:
And then place that [cautery] over the spot marked with the tent, in a downward-pressing manner, so that your hand is gradually compressed, and you rotate it.
And then gently lift your hand and observe the spot. If you see any significant amount of bone exposed, about the size of a grain of millet, then lift your hand; and if not, return your hand with that iron, with another of them, if it has cooled, until the bone is visible as I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth soaked in broth over it and leave it there until the burn scar from the fire is destroyed. And then treat the area with four-drug ointment until it is healed.
And if they say that when the wound remains open, it is better to leave the arm hanging down, because that is better and more helpful.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's substance is burned.
And then remove what has adhered to the bone, and then treat it.
And others say that with the cautery, you should go deep, until it firmly penetrates the bone until the bone breaks, and this is the method of small cautery. And they believe that from that location the vapors of the head escape.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
However, I have not seen these two types of cautery in all cases, but in some individuals according to the method of fear; and, in my opinion, it is better to be safe than sorry.  For the head is weakened by a disruption of its continuity, just as we have observed in other parts of the body, and especially when the patient's head is of a fragile nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and with that usage and method, there is safety.
Second Chapter.
Of the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain affects the entire head of a prolonged illness, and remedies such as leeches, cupping, purging, plasters, poultices, and similar applications have been used, and especially if the head has already been cauterized with a cautery that has not benefited the patient, then consider this: if the patient's head is strong in its nature and not fragile, and it suffers from significant cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below the previous one. And then cauterize that area above the patient's head with the cautery until the inflammation is broken up. Cut into the inflammation and expose the bone to the extent we have described, and cauterize that with a cautery on the back part of the head, in the area called the *vas* (vein) — which is the area where a cupping glass is placed. And ease your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will suffer much greater pain from this than from all other head cauteries.
And I will say this about the cautery in its place, for the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized must be a more delicate cautery than the one used on the middle part of the head; and this is the method for it.
Third Chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic migraines.
When there is constant pain in the head, or pain spreading to the eye, the head should be cleansed with remedies, and the other treatment I have mentioned in the discussions of diseases should be administered. If all else fails, cauterization in that area is done in two ways: either with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
However, cauterization with a burning medicine is when you take a clove of garlic, peel it, and excise the ends of both its heads. And then, with a thin lancet, cut into the painful area on the temple until a small area is created underneath the skin, so that it is hidden.
Then press upon it with a compress for a slow constriction, and leave it for three hours; then remove it and take away the garlic, and allow the wound to heal for two or three days, and then place a cloth soaked in wine or something similar on the area until it forms a scab.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But the cauterization with iron, according to this method: apply fire with a cautery, the procedure for which is as follows:
and it is called a 'claus clavilhs', because the head of it is shaped like a nail, with a slight curvature, and in the middle is a small projection.
And then place it over the painful area, and hold your hand — so that the tissue underneath isn't burned — and slowly rotate the small iron with speed.
And if the amount burned by the application of the cautery is as much as half of it, lift your hand so that the artery underneath isn't burned, so that blood flow doesn't occur.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place cotton soaked in wine, and then treat with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the blade of a scalpel, according to the cautery method, and be careful not to cut an artery in this specific, not-ancient, procedure.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the cauterization of old migraines.
When you treat a migraine using the methods described in the previous treatment, and in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and sometimes because the illness prevents you from using the previous cauterization methods with medicine or with fire, then you should heat the surgical knife until it is white-hot, and then apply it to the area of pain in a line that is half the length of your finger, or less; and hold your hand in place once and press firmly until you cut the artery and penetrate to the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the continuation of the jaw, which is strained by chewing, and that the ligament and the nerve that move it are not injured, and that a spasm does not ensue.
And if it concerns the guarding and caution against the flow of blood from the cut artery, for there is a fear in cutting it, and especially for the one who does not know what they are doing and is not skilled and experienced; and abandons the procedure prematurely.
And I will come back to the treatment of accidental blood flow from an artery according to its specific method, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this ailment is not cured by this cauterization, and you see that the patient's condition is tolerable, cauterize the middle of the head as previously described, and treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we described in the chapter on the constriction of an artery with a cautery having two blades; this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of cauterization for ear pain.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxatives and the other remedies mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is the one called the 'puncta' cautery, which has this form:
And then apply the cautery, close to the ignition point, and move it around the entire ear in a circular motion, or on the spot where the pain is localized if the pain is in a particular area. Move the cautery along the ear's base slowly, after marking the location with a probe.
And if the cautery has made ten punctures in the ear, and cauterizes those, and then treat the areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Of cauterization for torture.
Torture which is cured with cauterization is only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of torture with poultices, purges, and remedies, and your treatment doesn't work, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first at the base of the ear, the second a little below their temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the diseased part, for softening only occurs in the apparently healthy part.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery at the right point of the ear's extremity, a little above the corner of the head, and another on the temple, its length being equal to the length of the thumb.  You should press your cautery until the amount of the diseased area's thickness is half burned.
And this is the method of cauterization, and it is a type of surgery, the method of which is described below. However, it is more subtle than what you see; and the knife should remove a little bit of superfluous flesh.
And then treat the area with what has been previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning cauterization of old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is longstanding and you have treated it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment is not succeeding, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize in four places: above all the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery in the groin. And the method of cauterization is done according to what has been previously stated.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is further back; and subsequently it should be treated with what you are continuing to do.
Chapter 8.
Of cauterization of forgetfulness caused by flame.
There should be given to the patient at the beginning large jars and pills that purify the brain.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply a plaster of centaury described in the treatise on plasters to their forehead.
And apply that several times, for that is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And thus, if that heals him well, then do three cauteries on the back part of his head, which descend from the highest part of the head down to the lowest part of the neck. And place the width of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with what has been previously described.
But if the application [of cauterization] is gentle and the patient tolerates it, then apply the cautery to the middle part; and if the application is more intense, then cauterize it at the two points/horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be oiled according to the form given before.
Chapter 9.
Of cauterization for paralysis and softening of the entire body.
You must proceed with cleansing the head with herbs and as we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with cauteries on all the points/horns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if, in the illness of softening of the body, the patient is weak and the illness is severe, then cauterize them with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and indeed with a cautery until it is quite softened and the skin is significantly loosened, and then lift your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the brain of the person at the outset with herbs and the other treatment we have discussed in the division when the illness is severe and tolerates the removal of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then administer soothing remedies and masticatories that treat the brain, for several days beforehand, along with improving the diet.
And then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize the middle of the head with a cautery according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of the head, and cauterize on each temple. And if the illness is severe and tolerates it, then cauterize the affected area with the cauteries mentioned, having previously achieved paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-shaped, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then use a delicate cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humours and a thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries we have described in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him to drink what purifies his brain, according to what has been stated in the division [preceding sections].
Then shave the patient's head, and then apply a properly made trepanation to the skull, and then place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and held steady on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and an old sheep's fleece is most suitable. And heat that over a fire with a moderate, measured heat, which the said patient can tolerate when it is applied to him. And then place that in the middle of the patient's head, within the cranium, and leave it until it has cooled.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with the other treatments prescribed for him, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that area making small punctures according to the patient's tolerance, but keep your hand with a cautery that is suitably adjusted: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
And then apply that cloth soaked in wool or flaxseed poultice.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of descending water in the ear.
When you have identified the onset of water in the ear, using the signs I described in the previous section, then begin giving the patient drinks that will regulate their head and keep it free from moisture.
And have them sweat in a bath for several days.
Then order the patient to shave their head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize with two cauteries above the two temples if the beginning of the water in both ears is the issue, or on one side if it's just one ear.
Cut with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are below the scalp; and let the cauteries be of such a length as the width of the temples.
And be careful of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flow from it, stop it with any medicine possible.
And I will come with skill in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck between the two bones with two cauteries properly positioned.
Chapter 13.
Of cauterization of old sores.
When sores on the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries in the visible part of the head's exterior, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegm, then cauterize it with the cautery we described in the chapter on hot water applications to the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones (skull). And if further application is needed, then cauterize it along the entire length of the eye socket, on the brow ridge, with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Of cauterization of a foul odor from the nose.
When you treat it with what we have said in the division, and your treatment is not effective, then prepare and give the patient cockleshells to drink for three nights; and afterward, shave his head and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery and an olive-oil cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove-shaped cautery, using two cauteries on the two eyebrows below the hair, a small one.
And be careful of the sparks so you do not ignite the area.
And this is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cauterization for softening the eyelids of ulcers.
When the eyelid of an ulcer is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its shape:
And if you cauterize it, do so above the two eyebrows a little bit with two cauteries on all sides, and they should be elongated away from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the amount of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand with the cautery too much, but according to the amount that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
Chapter 16.
Of cauterizing the eyelid of the eye when the lashes are turned inwards and pierce the eye.
When the lashes of the eye are turned inwards so that they pierce the eye, cauterization in those cases is in two ways: either with cauterization through burning or with a comburent medicine.
If with a cautery of fire, first command the patient to cut their lashes like those who trim them, until they are extended and straightened; and if you pierce it near their origin, then you must bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so they are not aggravated until the lashes have grown back.
Then, once they have grown back and straightened, place the patient's head on your lap, and then carefully touch the eyelids of their eyes with a stylus, making a mark in the shape of a myrtle leaf, starting the mark near the eyelashes.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or plantain poultice on the eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this shape.
And then cauterize the area you marked, little by little, several times, until the surface of the affected area, which is approximately like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned away.
A sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye now contracted and the hairs of the eye raised towards the puncture of the eye.
And then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a bandage on it until the scab is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if any cause returns to the root of the hair and the eyelid becomes softened, then again perform cautery on that area, just as you did at first.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize them until they are raised to their natural place, are embedded, and the hairs no longer scratch the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine is that you command the patient to pull out the hairs until they are elongated and embedded, and then a leaf-shaped bandage of cloth should be fashioned.
And then take known herbs and living things, or whatever that is, and mix these things well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; and then spread some of this mixture onto the cloth bandage shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it over one or both eyes; and put a cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head should be on your lap.
And place the finger on the medicine and press it a little, and do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for the burning sensation is there just like a fire.
And so, when he perceives the burning sensation, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger; then when the burning stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider if the eyelid has already been lifted, as if it were loosened from constriction by fire or incision, for then it is good; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the area where the medicine did not take effect, and do not give up until your procedure is successful and the eye is healed.
And then apply a bandage to it until the burning is completely gone, and then treat it with a definitive ointment or something else until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, after your procedure, to watch with careful diligence that nothing of the medicine gets into the eye, and if after a few days the eyelid is softened and some cause of the hairs gets into the eye, then reapply your medicine to the softened area of the eyelid, and precisely as you did at the beginning, and then continue until it is healed.
And this is the method for treating eye injuries.
And know that human eyes vary in size and shape, and therefore your treatment is tailored accordingly.
And the way to recovery will not be hidden from the one who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula using the methods described in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment doesn't work, then you must cauterize it in this manner: tell the patient to place their head on your lap, and have a servant hold their head between your hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken by their head.
And then place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or marshmallow on their eye.
And then apply the cautery, whose form is:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a bird's feather, on the end with which the cautery is made.
And if desired, let it penetrate to the other end. And if you want, let it be shaped like a probe.
But nonetheless, the concave one is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and extract and dry that [matter]. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which is well-heated, upon it.  Hold the cautery with your hand, a little away from the cautery's hot part, near the bridge of the nose, so that neither your hand nor the patient is disturbed. Then place the cautery on the inflamed area and cauterize it.
And so, if your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary.  Leave it like that for three days, and then place cotton with a bandage on it and apply a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is clean as is appropriate in your chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier practitioners described as follows:  Apply to the location of the fistula and create an opening there; then place within that fissure a fine, thin piece of lead (of which the form is: [description of form is missing from the text]).  Place this amount of molten lead (about 1 ounce); and hold it firmly with your hand, so that the patient is not moved, to prevent the molten lead from reaching the eye. You should place on the patient's eye a cotton swab dipped in egg white or water, because molten lead will adhere to the fistula opening and heal it with remarkable success.
And if the fistula is healed by what we have said about the cautery and its treatment, then it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to make a hole in the nose and to push the fistula back into the nasal passage, returning it to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of cauterization of the fissure of the pot/a fissure of the  (ear, eye socket, etc., depending on the context of the pot) .
Many times fissures occur in the lips, especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have described in the sections and your treatment is ineffective, then heat the small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is described/shown:
And its [the cautery's] concavity should be according to the fineness/thinness of the blade.
Then carefully place that heated cautery on those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or on the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops, then bursts, and subsequently becomes chronic, and an ulcer forms, and a fistula develops, and you treat it, but the treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize with fire according to the size of the opening of the fistula.  Then introduce that heated instrument into the fistula's opening, and hold it until the heated iron reaches the bottom of the ulcer.  This is done once or twice, and then treat it with the remedies previously described until it heals.
And so, if the pus is expelled and the wound heals, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the decayed bone, as explained in its relevant chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are aching, and treatment with medications is ineffective, then place the patient's head on your lap.  Then heat the cautery, shaped as described below, so that you place the nozzle over the tooth and quickly introduce the heated cautery into it. Hold it for a short time so that the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and repeat the cauterization several times as desired.
Then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. For the aching tooth is sealed, the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the cauterization of tooth pain.
When tooth pain is caused by cold, or there is a cold or worm in the area, and medicinal cures do not work, then cauterization of that area is done in two ways: either with cow dung cautery, or with fire cautery.
Cauterization with cow dung is done by taking cow dung and boiling it in a metal dish, then taking a piece of cloth and wrapping it around the end of a probe, dipping that cloth in the boiled dung and promptly placing it on the aching tooth until it cools down.
And then repeat this a few times until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if desired, dip wool or cloth in the aforementioned cow dung and place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron onto that until the iron reaches the point of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by holding a heated iron or bronze instrument, ensuring its thickness is such that the heat doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, making sure of its shape, and place it on the tooth, and hold it there until the cautery cools; do this several times, for the pain may disappear either that day or the next day.
And it is necessary that, by pressing with the cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good cow dung and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize any extremity, as is possible for you.
And this is the method of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Of cauterization of extrophy.
When extrophy is due to phlegm and cold humors, and is not amenable to digestion by medicines, and you desire to digest them easily, then you heat the cautery, the shape of which is this, having two open ends so that smoke escapes from the cautery through one end, and place that heated cautery upon the abscess once, and again if needed, until it reaches the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and place on it a cloth soaked in water until that which the fire has burned is gone.
And then treat it with ointments, bandages, and dressings until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of a sore throat and the constriction of the ale (possibly meaning the windpipe/trachea).
When humidity affects the airway, especially when accompanied by a cold constitution, the patient should initially be treated with laxative medicines, and then the area near the root of the throat, at the affected spot, should be cauterized.
And be careful not to approach the throat with the cautery too closely, nor to burn the skin too much, but only slightly.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the junction of the neck, at the back of the spine. And the cautery should be a sharp, pointed instrument, following the previous method.
And then treat it with what was previously mentioned until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Of the cauterization of lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are caused by cold humidity and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the ailment is chronic, then cauterize the area with two cauteries on the furcula, in the depressed, distant, and sunken locations; and with another cautery in the middle area of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be pointed, according to the preceding method.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be done puncturing with the cautery called *puncta*, the method of which you described in the section on treating ear pain.
And make punctures in those areas; and then treat it with the same methods as previously described until it is healed.
And the cautery should have three prongs, for cauterization is done with it; in one instance you can make three cauteries in this fashion:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the 'titillic,' which is the head of the aid.
When the head of the 'ajutori' (a part of the body, possibly the clavicle) is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and is not secured at the time of its return to its original position, until it is correctly positioned there, and then, due to a small movement, it is easily displaced again, as we have witnessed,  then it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation, and afterwards turn the patient over on their back or side; then lift the bone (the clavicle) that is in the inner part of the 'titillic' to the upper parts, using the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.
And then apply the cautery with two heads; and this is the form of it:
Then cauterize the bone until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the form of cauterization will then be of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and for that reason the cauteries are eight.
And then place over the cautery some boiled (or cooked) salt, and then cause the patient to rest, and do not move the limb for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this has been done, then cauterize the muscle with a wedge-shaped cautery or with pointed cauteries, for the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, so that this detracts from its proper condition and multiplies in him/her, and if you continue the healing methods and don't correct it, then the patient should be on their back, extend their arms and legs, and then cauterize it with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet for the length of a finger with a wedge-shaped cautery, and two cauteries under the two sides of the body (chest), until the cauterization forms a triangular shape. And extend (the cauterization) between those parts that don't adhere to make it firm.
And if the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without additions.  And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this way; and this should be a cautery in the form of a circle in this shape:
And have the stomach cauterized by pricking where that cautery has caused fear: and so you should prick the stomach according to the amount you desire with a probe, and then cauterize those pricks with a cautery; and then cure it with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of cauterization of a cold liver.
When pain in the liver arises from coldness, or moisture, or excessive windiness, until its normal condition is restored by expelling superfluities, and the patient is treated by what we have discussed and not otherwise, then it is necessary that the patient be lying on their back, and prick with a probe three cauteries in this shape and this same size onto the liver beneath the hypochondria, where the human torso lies.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cautery should be the length of a straightened finger.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the amount cauterized is the size of half a finger's breadth, and no more is to be applied, and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then they should be lying down, having already spread their legs, and raised their arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these wounds with a knife cautery, when you possess skill and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not overdo the cauterization, and that the area the size of a finger's breadth is cauterized so that the whole body and the intestines are affected, because the finger's breadth is thin here, and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of a liver abscess with cautery.
When there is an inflammation or abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient finds heaviness and sharp pain.
And if it is in the liver's covering, with the pain is great sharpness, and often the doctors have already grown weary of the cure for it.
Therefore, the patient must be turned on their side; and then probe the location of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rag, the form of which has been shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the core, until healthy tissue appears.
And then treat that by treating the other abscesses until it is healed.
And one should only use this type of cautery if the study of it in the art of medicine is extensive, and many illnesses have known it;  but this one, with some experiment, sometimes might be daring on this operation, however, leave that to us, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
Of cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said cauterization of the roots of the art of medicine for pleurisy, caused by cold, should be done this way: take a long, dried root from the roots of Aristotle's work, a pointed, long root that is found, and it should be the thickness of a finger.
Then, immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire.  Then, cauterize with a cautery at the location between the continuation of the fork of the ribs and the neck; and with two small cauteries underneath, slightly angled toward the part below the chin.  Also use two cauteries on the area angled between the 5th and 6th ribs, slightly angled towards the back.  Then use another cautery in the middle of the foot; and another on the stomach, and three cauteries on the back.  Use one cautery on the area between the two shoulder blades, and two more cauteries on both sides of the foot, below the cautery between the shoulder blades.
And you should not hold your hand near the cautery; rather, it should be positioned clearly on the skin in use.
And some ancients would say that some people use an iron cautery shaped like a ray and heat it. Then they place it on the area between the ribs, until they reach the abscess and it discharges pus, as we have said regarding liver abscesses.
However, this cauterization is not without risk, for one can easily cause a fistula in the area, making it incurable.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen ailments with the methods described in the previous section, and your treatment doesn't improve the condition, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are effective. One way is to make three or four linear cauteries along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the cauteries for the liver, whose description precedes this.
And there should be a space between each cautery the width of a finger or slightly more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as that described for cauterizing the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient lie on their back.
And another method of cauterization is to apply the cautery with two applications of fire, a method described in the chapter on muscle dislocation.  Lift the blade, which is in the location of the spleen on the patient's left side.
And your lifting should be such that you lift the blade the length of the body, so that cauteries are made across the width of the body.
And then introduce the two fires, ignited strongly, into that space so that they penetrate the blade from the other side.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery using three applications of fire.
And now you treat the cautery, since it has stopped emitting pus after many days, for this is more important than the other preceding actions in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Of cauterization of dropsy patients.
Cautery is not applied to dropsy patients, but only to specific, localized swellings.
When you treat a dropsy patient with the methods of treatment we have described in the division, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one cautery on the right foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the severity of the swelling.
And leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not relieve the patient of the treatment near the cautery with what is necessary so that two intentions might be added to him, and the cure will be expedited with the help of healing.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the belly should be like a small nail, following the shape of the one above it, and the shape of the cautery used for the back should be olive-shaped, similar to the preceding one.
Chapter 32.
Of the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the area between the ring and little toe, and elevate your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and then elevate your hand, and do not completely return it, for the yellow water will recede.
The cautery should be shaped like this: Then make two cauteries on the two thighs, and on each thigh, make a cautery using the blade-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and another below the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with those things we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the belly/abdomen.
When the belly/abdomen is afflicted by cold and moisture, so that the powers are weakened, i.e., the digestive and retentive powers which are in the stomach and intestines, and this is cured through the methods of treatment and not by giving up, and sometimes the patient, enduring, displays their power, then cauterize it with a strong cautery on their stomach, following the precedent cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a fine, pointed cautery; and with a cautery on the flanks (or loins), with a large, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the excessive moisture and the patient tolerate it, then cauterize it on the groin and on the intestines, and by applying two cauteries firmly close to the stomach and the groin area, for it is a perfect healing, through the efficacy of which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are in their nature due to thick cold humors or corrupt moisture, and they are not cured by what we have said in the division, and you do not give up on your treatment, then cauterize with three cauteries on the protruding part below the coccyx, one small and one small triangular, and a cautery above the navel, positioned by two fingers.
And if you fear that their stomach is chilled, and their food is not digested, and their face is often inflamed, then cauterize it on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously mentioned; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on their spleen using a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of boils, near the excision of them.
When you excise a boil, then you heat the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then place that heated cautery into the excised boil, and finally press your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the boils are numerous, then cauterize each one of them as we have recounted, and then treat them with the ointments you prescribe for them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over a large area, it is more harmful in its effect.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are naturally present in those parts of the body.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described in its place, and the patient is distressed by this, cauterization should be used for treatment.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula that is naturally present, old, with flowing pus and corrupted moisture, then the most suitable course of action is to probe it with a thin probe, and then determine the depth of the fistula using the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery iron, which should be shaped like a ray. And then place that heated cautery iron into the fistula, according to the depth to which the probe went.
And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until those corrupted tissues are burned, once, twice, or thrice, as needed.
And be careful not to burn nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestines, then be careful of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge it not to be deep.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter has been cut away from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely cured.
And if the matter has not been removed from it, then know that it is deep-seated or the underlying tissue is corrupted, or that this comes from causes that will return to that place.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the kidneys.
When the kidneys are in pain due to cold or severe wind, and therefore the patient's body is inflamed, then it is necessary to cauterize that area on each kidney with a pointed cautery iron, from which the pain will be relieved.
And a second one is lightly cauterized a little lower, so that there will be three aligned cauterizations, and thus they will be more effective in relieving the pain.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize the area just below the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and cauterize with one cautery iron on the right side and another on the left.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the depth of the wound; and cauterize this with one cautery on the lowest part of the wound, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a pointed one, as is the procedure.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the mother.
When cold and humidity are present in the mother, and therefore pregnancy is prohibited, and her menses are corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then it is necessary that the area be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the area below the wound, or with two cauteries, and the cautery should be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of a dislocated shoulder.
When mucous humidity is effused to the shoulder joint, and causes it to leave its place, and a sign of this is that the arm is extended over the other when they are compared together. And the location of the dislocation is found where it is sore.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the shoulder area with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the area of the dislocated joint in a circle, so that the joint falls into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the same form used in cauterizing the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cauterization be done according to the severity of the entire condition; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the area of the groin, and it's caused by cold and humidity, if the patient is not cured by what we have already said and is not responding, then you must remove the patient's excess moisture by using fetid pills or artificial ones, or similar; and then cauterize the area.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods: one is to cauterize the area around the patient's groin with three triangular cauteries, following this form; and make a good depth with them. And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, if the cautery is small or large.
However, sometimes the cautery is placed over the middle of the groin area, so there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize using the circle, the form of which is used in the cauterization of a groin dislocation, ensuring it's a continuous circle and burn the inflammation throughout the entire area.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the groin and does not extend into the thigh.
However, if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, over the area where the pain is located; and with one cautery on the knee, about four fingers' width from the outer side.
And if the cautery is a knife, then the depth of the cautery should be according to the extent of the inflammation.
And if the patient feels the pain extending to the area near the toes, then cauterize there, using a cautery with three or four, or more points, as needed.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize that there with a knife-cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not use the cautery to the point of burning nerves or large arteries, lest you cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen others who have cauterized the ankle and pushed the cauterization too far, causing the leg to swell until the tumor reached the foot, and the foot to be perforated and corrupted. And then a strong bowel movement occurs, and then death.
And if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each part in this way.
And some learned men advise, regarding cauterization of a wound, that the cautery should be shaped like a ring of iron, whose circumference is half a palm; and it should be approximately the thickness of a date seed, or slightly less.
And within that ring should be another one-third; and the space between them should be the size of a pistachio nut; and those rings should be open in two parts; and the length of those sections should be one or two nuts; and make in those iron markings decently shaped into the rings; and this is its form:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the wound, the patient lying on their side. And therefore cauterize that wound with three round cauteries at one time.
And then leave that for three days; then plaster it with wool and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Says Albucasis:  Oh, children, of this type of cautery we have used little due to the fear of its appearance, and because few have been found who look upon it favorably.
But the best cauteries are for those who endure it, and find the location of it.
But cautery with adhering medicines is what you should do:  Make two circles using a perforated instrument, in which there should be a handle (hinge) similar to the handle of an iron gate;  the length of the wall should be equal to the height, and there should be two nuts or pegs on them.
And if the space between each is the amount of the finger's thickness; and they should be open at the bottom and top, and should contain themselves between each other in this shape:
Then, place the sick person lying on their right side over the affected area, and place your hand over the affected area; then, take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and keep the temperature low and gradual using a small fire.  Maintain this for about an hour, and let the patient endure the biting and burning sensation—because this produces a burning sensation similar to fire—until the biting stops.
Then, raise your hand with the instrument and wash away the warm water from the entire affected area with fresh water.
Then, leave it for three days and apply a compress until the blackening of the burn has subsided.  Leave it for several days, and the pain will eventually reduce; this is the final treatment.
Then, treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, apply a poultice there containing water, just as was done to the affected area previously.
And this is the method for applying warm water, and I have already written about it in my treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take an equal part of ashes and lime, both finely ground.  Place them in a new, unglazed pot, the bottom of which has a small hole, commensurate to the size of the patient's wound.
Place another, glazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot. Pour fresh, soft water over the ashes and lime, pouring it in a slow, controlled manner with a finger-tip.  Then gently squeeze the mixture with your hand to ensure good compression, and allow the liquid to drip from the top pot, collected in the glazed pot below.
Then collect all that water and pour it over fresh lime and ashes (re-ground), for it will then be a very strong caustic agent, used in many medical procedures and cauterizations of other parts of the body, as it produces a burning effect.
Some of the medicines used for broad cauterization include, for example, turpentine, honey, and crushed lime, mixed together.
And Galen recounted a procedure and cure from one of the ancients, which was used to treat pain in the groin and sciatic nerve.  He greatly praised this method, stating that it needed no other treatment.  And because it's healed in one instance as he recounted, he says it's a powerful treatment for an affliction that quickly heals with bathing, and is thus well-proven.
And it is necessary to take fresh green verdigris, or if verdigris cannot be found, then take fresh fig leaves; finely crush them with a little bit of gravel and place them over the afflicted groin, thigh, or leg and bind them in place.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels relief from the burning sensation.
Then place the patient in a bath, and once his body is warmed, place him on the ground, for the pain will cease and he will be healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these remedies except after the body has been emptied.
However, Esquirdes says that when a goat's tendon is cauterized, this greatly benefits the patient; and the cautery should be performed in this way: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it between the veins of the foot and the bones.
Then take a dry goat's tendon, and burn it in fire until it is charred; then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is spread out. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the sensation of the bite reaches the inside and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of veins.
Chapter 42.
Of cauterization for pain in two (places/areas).
Sometimes pain in the back is caused by various things, such as injury, blows, or excessive discharge, and by similar causes, by the infusion of cold and damp matter.
And cautery is only effective in this single type of case, which is caused by the outflow of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the patient with  pills and similar remedies, placing them on the back where the pain is, in three lines according to its width, then applying five or more cauteries to each line, according to the patient's tolerance and the strength of the treatment.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a medial wedge-shaped cautery, following this method:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of a swelling.
This illness often affects young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it affects their structure, causing pain in the limb and difficulty with raising and moving it.
And you find that the vertebrae at the back of the spine, and the ones below them, are beginning to protrude above the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery that is circular, in this shape: that takes the cautery over the entire area of the vertebra evenly.
And if you wish, cauterize along the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery, two or three lines. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful not to apply the cautery to a swelling caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter XLIV.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that are infused into each part of the body, and when pain comes to the feet, it is properly called gout by custom of physicians.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold is treated with a method of healing, and the pain does not subside, then cauterize it.
And you cauterize that area around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And it is an olive cautery, of which this is the form of it:
And if it is necessary to make a puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area above each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides with this olive cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize that area, but do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand, only around the shape of the wound.
And if the pain reaches the thigh and knee, then apply the cautery which we have mentioned in its chapter.
If the pain is only in the hands, and it is called "suagra," then puncture around the joints in the manner of a spiral, puncturing on those two lines.
And if pain remains in the said area, then puncture around the joints over each finger and over the palm of the hand.
And if the pain spreads to the knees or muscles over a few days, then cauterize the affected areas all around.
And do not evacuate the illness with good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, it will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines are protruding before the hernia, and this is beginning to happen, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to stop eating on that day and that they use soothing remedies so that the rupture recedes from their abdomen.
And then support the patient between your hands on their side, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines are fully ejected or reappear.
Then, using your hands and gentle pressure, return that [the protruding part]  and with a bandage bind the rupture to the hip bone, using a bandage whose extremity resembles a half-circle on the parts of the body above the [affected] area.
And now apply the cautery, which has this shape:
until it is very red and throws sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out again.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, and another servant is holding the legs, and another servant is holding their chest, holding the patient's hands.
And then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery straight, and hold it until you reach the bone of the pubic region (penal bone?) into the middle of the tendon; and do it again if you have not reached the bone in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest the patient suffer death or other great harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery used on children be subtle, according to their size and measure.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the scab from the fire is gone.
And then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the wound and the affected area are sealed.
And you must regulate their nourishment according to the duration of their treatment, which should soothe their abdomen and prevent the intestines from protruding due to the healing effort.
And then, after approximately 40 days, administer a properly made bandage, and let them keep it on for another 40 days.
And abstain from strenuous work, overeating, and strong emotions, for if they follow this regimen of treatment thoroughly, they will be healed.
And I will describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen.  If, at the beginning, you want to prevent them from protruding, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery iron, proportional in size, and use the same amount of cautery as a third of the rupture; then treat it with the methods mentioned before, and this will not be appropriate.
And some early practitioners would say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery iron, in this form, after it has been marked with a probe:
And a line is placed horizontally across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and you place your hand with a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
Of cauterization of twisting.
When in some limbs, due to twisting or impact, pain occurs and that pain persists for a long time, and you do not find a cure with medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be on each limb according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, and the location of the twist and pain.
So if it is healed by the first cautery, good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be punctured from a limb to the limb nearest it, so that it is necessary to continue with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some leprous conditions are greatly helped by cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that person, consider if the leprosy is superficial and can be cured with what we have said in the division, and do not, therefore, be afraid of the illness spreading throughout the body and affecting its constitution.  If you fear that the corruption will spread, then cauterize the affected area on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, another below it, one on the forehead near the hairline, two at the temples, and one at the back of the neck or nape.
And finally, press the cautery slightly into the bone to create a small impression, so that the discharge of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize on the spleen as required.
And if the leprosy has already spread extensively on the patient and is clearly evident, then you must cauterize the affected areas with the cauteries we described for the head; and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheek, and two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and a large one on the vertebrae near the tailbone, one on the tailbone, two on the hips, one on each hip, two on the groin and one on each groin, two on the thighs, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of each foot; and cauterize the affected areas on all the joints of the fingers and toes, on the heel of each foot, and on the soles of the hands.
Be careful of the nerves located on the heels, so you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the hip bone, another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more beneficial and helpful it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cauterization, as they do with lances, because the patient's body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be large or small, depending on the limbs and joints, as is dictated by the specifics of the tools used.
Then treat the cauterization with flour of erbs cooked with honey and other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning cauterization for numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery enter the flesh slightly. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness that affects the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back, and the nerves that affect that limb, is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
However, do not presume upon this unless you are knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the pathways of nerves throughout the moving body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of white spots (leprosy, or a similar skin condition).
When the white spots are old, and none of the medical ointments are helping, then you cauterize the area with a cautery iron, a little at a time according to the severity of the affected area, until the whiteness and its color is gone, and the color of the skin is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils mixed with heated olive oil, and with leaves of sorrel, and with either pigeon blood or swallow blood (one part of each), mixed together.  Then apply a linen cloth to the area and leave it there until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Of the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around it, in the same way as it is twisted (or rolled).
And the wise men say it should be cauterized with the back of the cautery in the middle; but I do not see this, for I fear it will become ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around it with a circular cautery as we have said, or with many small cauteries.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of tumors.
When a tumor is delayed in maturation, and this is due to excess fluids, or due to the patient's age, as they are old and decrepit, with little blood, or due to the passage of time, and you want to accelerate the tumor's maturation, then cauterize around it with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten in maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the tumor until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a place lower down, so that the arm's limb is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Of the cauterization of a corrosive substance.
A corrosive substance is a wandering corruption in the limb, which corrodes it as if by a fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if that corrosive substance is in a location suitable for cautery with fire, then you apply cauteries with a few small, and larger ones, according to what is appropriate for the location where the corrosive substance is.
And then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire corrosion and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply dressings with oil mixed over the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days the new flesh is healthy where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on the parts that remain corrupted.
And sometimes it is treated with a sharp medicine, for that acts as a substitute for cautery. But cautery with fire is a quicker remedy.
And I have already mentioned the treatment with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you need it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of ulcers and similar conditions.
Often in the parts beneath the diseased foot, an ailment called an ulcer occurs, a deep, festering wound, which afflicts the foot; and cauterization for these is done in two ways: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is done by igniting a hollow cautery resembling a small torch, made of iron according to the size needed to cover the entire ulcer, and be composed of thin wires.
Then place this ignited cautery over the ulcer, and then move your hand with the cautery around the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer. And leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you must apply cauterization with water. Take a cannula of bronze, iron, or vulture bone, and place it over the ulcer.  Pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand steady.  Move the cannula around the ulcer with pressure, pressing the edge of the cannula into the root of the ulcer, ensuring the hot water reaches the base of the ulcer.  Allow the patient to endure the hot water's effect for an hour, then remove it. This will eradicate the ulcer from its roots.
And thus do with those and then the others until you have treated all affected areas on the body.
And then treat those pus after the roots of the ulcers are eradicated with the ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 44.
Of cauterization for tremor.
When someone suffers from tremor due to cold in the nerves, or a cold fever, or another similar cause, then you should cauterize the affected area with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach with an olive oil cautery.
And the tremor will subside, and the health of the cold illness will be hastened.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization for white spots/accidents on the body.
When white spots appear on the body, and pustules or sores are formed from corrupted, thick matter; then, as soon as it appears, it is necessary to cauterize the top of each sore with a fine cautery, using a myrtle stick whose tip is heated in fire, or with the roots of a long-rooted herb, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes a cauterizing agent is applied at the beginning of its expulsion in this way; and if it is not believed, and the excess is broken up through these means, the body heals from it.
However, this must be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the cauterization of an accidental blood flow through an arrow wound.
Many times an arrow wound bleeds profusely from the wound itself, or from an abscess or cauterization of the limb, and similar situations.  It is difficult to stop that bleeding.
Therefore, if this happens to someone, then you should press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your index finger over it, pressing many times until the flow of blood under your finger stops and does not start again.
And then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, many of them, and blow over them until they are very hot.
Then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken, and quickly place the cautery over that vein after you have stopped the bleeding with your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding is excised and restricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are being heated in the fire, and thus do not stop doing this one after another until the bleeding is controlled.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, lest further harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it is not already extracted, because when it is extracted the extremities are damaged and the bleeding is stopped, or by tying it with a thread or ligament in a strong constriction, or by placing medicines on it whose virtue is to stop the bleeding; and they should be pressed with a cushion with a suitable constriction.
However, the one who applies a suitable constriction with a bandage and a tight wrap, or by placing burning substances or similar, will only achieve a delayed effect.
But if this happens to someone and the physician is not present, nor is any medicine available, then one should apply pressure with the index finger on the artery's opening, as we said, and apply great pressure until the blood is stopped from flowing out of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and over the artery it should be sprinkled with extremely cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and one should further consider whether a cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incisions, perforations, cupping, phlebotomy, wounds, and similar conditions.
We have already discussed in the first chapter all illnesses for which cauterization with fire or a burning medicine is appropriate, and the occasions and causes for this, and the necessary instruments and the forms of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the head's supremacy down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way, so that the seeker may be relieved concerning that which he has sought.
And before I begin this, children, you should understand that in this chapter, this topic is similar to the first chapter on cauterization.
And therefore, great caution is required, for in the operation described in this chapter, many times there is evacuation that involves blood, which is vital to the process of bloodletting from a vein or incision over an abscess or the opening of a fistula or the cleansing of a wound or the removal of an arrow or the incision of a stone and similar procedures. And all of those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in their case death is a possibility.
And I warn you that this should not happen to you, for sometimes the ways of men bring many diseases. And some of them get angry with their illness, and death is near for them, due to the intensity of their illness, the length of their suffering, and the illness itself signifies the fear of death.
And of those is the one who gives you their possessions and says, "You await recovery," yet their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to those who come to you with this kind of illness. Your caution should be greater than your desire and your recklessness.  Do not assume anything about this, but rather seek certain knowledge that verifies this for you, and then pursue a commendable outcome.
And in treating all your patients, use prognosis and indication of the path to recovery, for in this lies your help in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, children, may God inspire your understanding and not deny you direction and protection, for it is in his hands.
And I have organized this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, just as the previous chapter on cauteries did, from the care of the head to the feet, so that what you seek and need regarding this may be made easier for you.
First Chapter.
Of the treatment of water that is contained within the heads of children.
Know that this illness often affects children during or shortly after birth, and when the nurse holds the child's head too tightly without gentleness.
And sometimes it arises from a hidden cause that is unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those I saw, death ensued, and therefore, I leave this treatment to others.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was constantly swelling until he could no longer support himself due to the size of his head, and that the moisture continued to increase until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the skin and the bone, or it collects below the bone on the spine.
When the treatment in that case where the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should cut into the middle of the head with a cut lengthwise, and the length of the incision should be about two fingers until the moisture flows out.  This is the method of "spatum.
And therefore, if the moisture is more extensive and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, the sign of it is that you see the edges of the head opening up in every direction, and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand in different spots, and this isn't hidden from you. You should cut into the middle of the head with three incisions in this manner:
Then remove all the moisture from the incision; then bind the incisions with cloths and bandages; then apply wine and oil to it until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments, and bandage the head evenly; and the patient should eat dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, which considers where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and so consider with the incision where the abscess and the fluid collection appear, and make it as best you can.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest blood flow and the patient die from that blood loss with the moisture evacuation.
Second Chapter.
When there is a persistent cold or inflammation in the eyes or foot, and previous medical treatments have not been effective, then the final treatment in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incise those arteries where the illness has affected the head, you should first rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then the patient's neck should be supported with some cloth.  Then consider where the vein pulses, and mark the locations of each artery near the ears, as they are hidden in some people.
Then, mark the artery with a probe, and then cut each artery with a sharp incision that penetrates the bone, following the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the blade under the artery and sever it at the incisions on the upper parts.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers' width, for when any vein is incised, the blood is expelled with a pulsating flow, leaping out in frequent spurts.
But if the artery does not appear on the surface, then you must measure from the ear the distance of three fingers, and then mark with a probe and cut through to the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be drawn is about a wine unit, or more or less, depending on the patient's condition and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of inflammation remains on the bone, then cut through that so that a painful abscess does not develop.
And then compress the wound with lint and bandages of cloth, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When someone experiences an old migraine or a sudden sharp headache, due to acrid humors and a quality in the temples' tissues, or a severe, old headache similar to these, and it is treated with the known medicinal remedies and it does not improve, then we have found in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or the cauterization of those, just as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient shaves the hair that is on the temples; and locate the artery that appears on the temple, because it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden except for a few people by the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water to the area until the artery becomes clearly visible to you. And then you take the instrument, which is shaped like this: And then you gently scrape the area with it until you reach the artery; and then apply it where and extract that in superior portions until you extract that from the membrane and expose it from the tissues under it, on all sides.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with the tip of the instrument, and then cut off a portion of it according to the amount that its extremities are stretched and contracted, so there won't be a blood flow, because if it's not cut, the blood won't rise at all.
And then evacuate the blood from one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double flax threads or with long cords, and do not cut it until the wound is consolidated and blood flow occurs.
And then cut away the excess that is between the two ligaments; and do this at that time or another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that with a cautery until the bone, with a knife cautery until its extremities are cut, and it will remain in place from that same work.
And it is better work if the patient does not have a fever or is of a hot constitution; for cautery is of those things that help ending humidities, and therefore is better in youth.
And it is necessary, after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton, and be placed over it powders well made, and then be treated with dry medicines that make the flesh grow and with poultices until it is healed.
And if, while working, a flow of blood from the artery occurs again, then you must strive to stop that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with cotton, and pressing your hand until the blood is stopped. And if none of those things is present for you, then place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and apply water of intense cold until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as is necessary.
And the easiest method in extracting an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two knives, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and cauterize each, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the ends of it is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two knives should be equal. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two knives, it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives, it will burn each part, and it will not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those areas, the heat of the fire is maintained on them, and the flesh is cut off easily.
And this method is better than all other methods and more effortless.
And the space between the two knives should be the width of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of acute and acrid sores of the eyes.
When the eyes are acrid, and the sores are in the veins running on top of the head, and you don't find any medicinal cause for treatment, and sometimes the patient's face turns red and feels like ants crawling on their forehead, and the eyes themselves are weakened, moist to the point their skin is transparent, and the eyelids are irritated by the acidity of the tears, the ancient masters of medicine used a specific treatment for this, and called it "spassa.
And you command the patient to shave the hair from their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, along the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers wide: one incision should be equidistant to the length of the nose, in the middle of the forehead; the second, along the length of a bit past the movement of the muscles that are in the lacrimal area; and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the blood vessels that are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And the space of each incision should be the size of three fingers put together.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to absorb the blood.
And then place the spatula with its two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of the incision to be made: which is from the temple area to the second incision. Scrape with that all the flesh that is between the two incisions with the chisel that is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then, remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of this against the flesh attached to the flesh, and the blunt side against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with this all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But the incision should be continued into that part of the flesh, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And once a considerable amount of blood flows, squeeze the places of the solidified blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old cloth, and place on them powders mixed with wine, oil, and sour wine, and take care that it does not become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of hot or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with bruised oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of sores (or wounds) through purging, and for sores descending from the parts within the head.
When a patient experiences sharp and continuous purging, and the sores on the patient's body are small and emaciated, and the care of those sores is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin is peeling, and there is acute pain in the scalp and subsequent exhaustion, then know through these symptoms that the matter and purging come only from many veins within the head.
And the best treatment in these cases is this: command the patient to shave their forehead, and then make a slit in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin with the slit from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and move your hand away from the lacerations of the temples that are close to the jaw). Until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the gap between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. And then compress with powders mixed in wine and oil, so that a painful abscess does not develop.
And when you have removed this and see that the abscess has already diminished, then it is necessary to cauterize the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat that with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth, just as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and make a poultice from them, and apply it to these wounds to encourage flesh regeneration.
Chapter 6.
Of the treatment of that which hurts in the ears.
Any ailment in the ears belongs to one of four types: either it is a mineral, or something similar to a mineral, such as iron or glass; or it is from a plant, like a thorn or bean; or it is a flowing cause, like water or sour wine and things like them; or an animal.
And therefore, when a stone or a similar object, not belonging to the ear and not growing within it, enters the ear, and you expose the ear to the sun, and if the stone is moving, then apply a concoction of olive oil or pitch, then extract it, and induce sneezing with a remedy, and hold the nostrils during the sneezing action. Then place some cloths or wool around the ear and pull the ear upwards in parts, for often it is forced out by these means.
And if it is not forced out, then administer extraction with a tool called a *gesti epicicarios subtil*, of which this is the form:
And if it is forced out by the tool, it is good; and if not, then administer extraction with a thin, slightly curved forceps.
And if it is not forced out by that, then make a copper cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the ear hole, and seal the area around the cannula with softened wax and oil so that only the cannula is open. And then extract with your hand with strong pulling, for often with what we have described.
But if it is not forced out in this manner, then take a lighted torch or a similar device with which birds' nests are caught, and place a small amount of it at the end of the ray, and then carefully wrap it around that already placed cloth. And then gently insert that into the ear hole, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then you must attempt to cut it before it becomes a painful abscess or spasm.
And the method of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to the patient's constitution, and then make that incision between your hands and turn the ear outward, and make a small cut at the base of the ear towards the patient's cheek in the location pressed firmly by the patient. And let the cut be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; and then close the cut immediately, and treat it until it heals.
And if the cause of the inflammation in the ear is one of the swellings which grow and become inflamed, then administer the cure and extraction of it; but if it does not yield to your treatment, then you shall take a subtle spongy substance according to this method: and administer with that the removal of that swelling that has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already been softened by the moisture of the ear, and break it into small pieces, and remove these with tweezers or with a delicate touch, or with a cut as we have described, because the removal will be easier.
But in the case of water that has entered the ear, the patient should initially use sneezing as a remedy, and fill their ear with some old cloth, and lie down on the side that has the water in the ear. If this expels the water, it is good; and if not, then take smooth, round stones the length of the finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and let the patient insert one into the ear canal and place one foot on that side of the body, and strike with another stone on the stone that is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water has been expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water has been expelled. And when the water has thus been expelled, take some paper or linen, and put one end of it into the ear, and draw the other end with fire until the majority of it is burned.
Then put another piece of linen in, and do this as many times as necessary until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a tube, as was described above for removing the stone.
However, in the extraction of a small animal or similar object that has entered the ear, treat it as described in the previous section; but if it is a large object that causes swelling, then perform the extraction using instruments and hooks.  The removal of this is easier than any other object that might enter the ear.
However, in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it as described in the previous section and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not work, then you should expose the ear to sunlight.
And if any sign of worms is apparent, then extract them with thin instruments or hooks; but if no signs appear, then take a narrow-at-the-bottom, wide-at-the-top tube, which has this shape: Insert the narrow end of the tube into the ear according to the patient's tolerance; and then suction strongly with it, doing this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it doesn't respond to this treatment, then you should plug and seal the area around the tube with wax, as previously described.  Then apply distillations, which the ancients have already tested in treating worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And your application should be with the instrument used to pour medicinal oils into the ear, which has this shape: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and flat at the top.
And so it should be, like a pump, to continuously force what is within the tube's cavity where needed. And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its end properly with cotton, then gently pour oil into the cavity of the ear instrument, or the juice of any herb, or whatever medicine you choose into the tube—and it is in the ear—and then insert the reed with cotton on top, and press with your hand gently until the oil is expelled into the ear cavity and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is put into the ear should first be warmed slightly by fire. And be careful that the substance you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the treatment of ear blockage.
Sometimes children inherit this from their parents' unperforated stomachs, and this sometimes happens in adults, a blockage in the ear canal due to pus or some kind of flesh growing there; and this blockage is sometimes located at the entrance of the ear canal, preventing the passage of sound, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the entrance, preventing the passage of sound, is in the majority of cases more difficult to treat.
And in those cases where sound *does* pass through, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And therefore, if the blockage appears, open it with a very thin instrument, of which this is its shape:
If its extremity has a small width, with one side sharp and the other not; and the instrument has two thin strands, so that it does not damage the ear.
And therefore, if the blockage is due to flesh grown in the ear or its passage, then remove it with thin forceps, and cut it with forceful ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the opening of the ear, then take a very thin, sharp reed and slightly heat it with fire, then place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have detected a blockage that the patient finds difficult to hear, ease the pressure on it gently, and take care not to injure the ear nerves.
And then place a cloth, according to the width of the hole you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for a few days until you are sure of the wound's healing; or take some [substance], and put that in water and pulverize over it; and use that; and if the ear is already suppurating, then you must remove that [substance] and replace it with another [substance] which you will wrap in a plaster made with warmed oil, until the suppuration subsides; and then treat it until it is healed.
However, if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use other treatments to stop the bleeding, as described in the distillation treatise.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of [a condition] that afflicts the eyelids.
Afflictions that come to the eyelids of the eyes sometimes are moist, sometimes are dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or forceps, and separate them from their roots with a spatula, and then apply a poultice to the affected areas.
But if pain with blood flow occurs, then you cauterize those with a thin, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is close to the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains from their roots; and when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that occurs on the eyelids.
Often, in the eyelids, a cause similar to a swelling in its strength and hardness exists, and thus it is called swelling.
And it is a collection of thick moisture on the eyelid, both below and above.
Therefore, the operation in their case is to consider whether the swelling originates from something visible on the eyelid and is spreading in every direction; and the cause of it is mild.
Then make a slit across it [the swelling], and then carefully scrape it away from all sides until it is drained.  Then suspend it with a forceps and excise it.
And if the figure [the swelling] is large, then you should close it with stitches; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not suffer harm from it, because the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the size [of the swelling] is receding towards the inside of the eyelid, closer to the surface, then raise the eyelid, and suspend the swelling with forceps, other than using an incision, and press it from every side.  And if the eyelid is stretched by an incision, that does not matter in any way.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with something that promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a cyst on the eyelid above the eye.
A cyst is a growth that is generated in the tissues of the eyelid above the eye, and it most often affects children, irritating their eyes and causing them trouble in the morning; and they cannot look at the sunlight because of it, for tears collect in their eyes.
And so you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and their eyelids below their eyebrows are wet, which are already covered with inflammation, and the appearance of a cyst is present in the eye; and that when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the cyst inside them.
And a method of operation is that the patient rests their head on your lap, then lay a cloth over them and warm it, and make a circle around the cyst according to the size that contains the entire cyst, then place it over it and press with your fingers so that the cyst is aggregated in the center of the circle, then make a small incision in the middle of that moisture with a sharp instrument, and the incision should not be larger than that made in a bloodletting procedure.
But before that, you must cut through the skin entirely until you reach the cyst, for in the many positions, the cyst proceeds through a fissure, in the form of a white fat.
Then remove it with cloths which you have wrapped between your fingers on the outside, and roll it between your right and left hands until it is gone.
And be careful not to press too hard on the incision, so that with the instrument you do not reach the opening and damage it.
However, if the cyst does not appear at the beginning of the incision, but you gently press on the incision until the cyst emerges; then remove it as we have said; then soak cloths in warm water and vinegar, and place them over the area, and compress them with powders.
And some who crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision, so that the remaining moisture is absorbed.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if there is a boil or abscess in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Methods of treating the eye.
When on the eyelids of the eyes there form growths beneath the natural skin, and they become hardened, these affect the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and surrounding tissue, eventually leading to destruction of the eye, which is called "tactinir" of the eye.  It is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine, as previously described in the chapter on cautery; or a "tactinir" is treated by incision and suture; or by use of leaches, as I will describe.
Therefore, you should place the patient's head on your lap; then, carefully grasp the eyelid with your left hand, and if it is turned back, it is fine.  If not, insert a needle into the area where a thread is to be placed, under the eyelid.  Push the needle through, thread above.  This should be done near the eyelid's edge, where the hairs grow - close to the hairs. Pull the thread towards the upper portion of the eyelid, and hold it back in place with a tool.
Then, in the inner part of the eyelid, under the hardened skin, carefully cut between the upper and lower tear ducts;  then, remove the thread and place small powders of cotton or cloth under the eyelid.  Then, apply a bandage to the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape of the bandage must be adapted to the height of the eyelid swelling, as this varies from person to person.  Some individuals require a large incision in the eyelid, depending on the extent to which the eyelid is swollen.
And then, use the scalpel along the two lines you have marked, starting from the upper tear duct and extending to the lower tear duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, it should be as wide as the king's finger.
Then place the forceps at one of the two corners of the wound, carefully scraping the entire area.  Next, join the two edges of the wound with fine wool thread or suture, and cleanse the blood.  If you wish, you should apply any excess thread over the eyebrows with some adhesive substance. Otherwise, do not worry about it.
Then leave the stitches of the threads for three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its adhesion; however, sutures are better.  And therefore, the ancients said this.
But nonetheless, let there be care taken over the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is no need for fear.
And there is another method in treating this, and it is that one makes a mark on the eyelid, like a myrtle leaf, and then elevates the eyelid with three forceps, arranged and joined in this fashion:
But if that is not possible, having the forceps, and that is not suitable, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the mark, and insert the other thread close to the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads evenly between your fingers, and then with those threads, elevate your hand with a suitable elevation, elevating the entire area marked as we have described.
And then close the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with poultices and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes the eyelid's lashes turn inward, then you should use what we have said about incisions in that case; however, a suture in such a case is more appropriate.
To treat with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the figure that is inside according to what I have described; and then, by art, make two thin canes or strips whose length is according to the eyelid's length and whose width is less than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.
Then gently attach each [thread] to the excess of the eyelid's skin, and tightly bind the canes [or strips] to each part, and leave it for a few days, for the skin will die from the constriction and become useless and decompose until it falls off by itself.
But if it has been delayed, then break it with the forceps, and then treat the wound until it heals.
Thus, when it is soldered, the eyelid is raised and the skin does not prick.
And this is the way of two canes which you will make according to this method: and have the quantity of the length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of lifting pricking hairs in the skin with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural hairs, hard and rough, pricking the skin, then the operation on them is that you take a fine needle and place it on a fine, thin piece of linen or silk, and then carefully adjust the ends of it, tying each end very subtly. And the length of the threads should be about the length of a handspan.
And then you should add another fine thread underneath it quickly, and tie the ends of that one if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on your lap, and position it close to the light so your work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
Then, carefully insert the needle into the root of the attached hair that needs removal, and quickly push it through the eyelid until you pull the unnatural hair out from above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out above and place it in a container, and there should be one, two, or three hairs, no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair is pulled out, along with the foreign matter, from the eyelid and away from the natural hair.
However, if only the foreign matter is pulled out and the hair is not removed, you will pull the foreign matter in different directions beneath with the ointment you have prepared until the foreign matter is completely removed from the wound.
And cover it with a bandage, for then you will have removed the foreign matter and the ointment.  Everyone will then press and close the wound, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you attach a longer hair from the natural ones, and lift with it, or leave it until it is extended approximately a certain distance, and then you lift that.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of a wound that occurs on the eyelid above.
When a wound (laceration) occurs on the eyelid, and it's a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upward, either on the right or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cauterization, and is called a "harelip," and this laceration is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the failure to heal from a wound, incisions, or cauterization, or similar poorly healed ailments.
The method of the operation on it is that you split open that scar tissue and separate the edges of it, and place in between them a piece of linen cloth, and bind them together until they are healed.
And it is not appropriate to use treatments that dry it out or constrict it, for if you do so, the wound will return worse than it ever was before.
Use treatments that soften it, such as fenugreek, and apply it with water in which marshmallow root and linseed are soaked, or diachylon ointment, which is liquefied with some oils, and soak the cloth in that, and heal with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you should perforate it (the wound) with any instrument as long as it is not healed in the same form as it was in the beginning.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing other than a correction of the ulcer that does not return the area to the form it was in before.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of an ulcer that is located on the lower eyelid.
This ulcer, which is located on the lower eyelid, truly is an ulcer; and it is either of natural origin or accidental.
But accidental ulcers are caused by a wound or a cut or a cauterization or other similar causes.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the tear duct on the left side to the tear duct on the right side, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
And then stretch the flesh outwards with the needle and sew it together with the needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel. And thus, if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, good; but if not, take the thread and place it in the slit, and with it reposition the eyelid, and close the two fissures on the lower eyelid's edge.
And let the ends of the two fissures be two angles of the incision, which you have made until they meet, and let them form an angle where they join, so that the shape is formed by their meeting.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then remove the flesh to the extent that the sharp edge is below the eyelid.
And then bring together the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medicines and poultices we have mentioned, until they are healed.
And if a wound needs to be treated by incision, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid, as previously described. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In summary, the treatment of a wound above or below, during the operation, should follow the preparation of the wound, and this has various forms.
And the skilled artisan always prepares in every possible way until he restores the figure to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient according to what is appropriate for him in the operation and with the best tools.
Chapter 15.
Of the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in many people, such that the eyelid is glued to the white part of the eye, and is hindered from its natural movement and functions, then you must insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and lift it up, or extend it with forceps.
And then you cut the adhesion with a sharp, but not overly sharp, blade.  Make the cut small so the patient is not distressed by the operation, and keep the blade from damaging the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should skillfully cut through that adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water into the eye, with which you wash it; or distill in it a solution of zinc dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid and the eye with a warm compress, and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye.  Then, on the third day, use healing substances until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of incision of the nail and the protruding flesh of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, either nervous, and is like a hard, subtle chip; or non-nervous, similar to frozen white moisture, which when iron touches it, or if forcefully picked up with a forceps, is cut off and the forceps does not get stuck in it.
And both types begin from the larger tear duct, gradually extending to cover the eye and preventing light and eye movement.
But the method for the incision is that the patient places their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and now grasp the nail with forceps of little curvature and pull it towards the upper edges. Then take a needle and thread it with a horse's, ox's, or cow's hair, or similar strong thread, or double the tip of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, penetrating it with the needle, and securing the nail with the thread. Pull it towards the upper edges, and scrape the nail bed, using the hair, that is covering the pupil. And thus you secure it with the hair to the back of it.
And then you cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or small scissors, and leave the tear duct's natural flesh so that the incision does not cause a continuous flow of tears.
Sometimes the nail, with just forceps, or with thread, as we have said, is pulled out, and then scraped with a lion's spatula, of which this is the shape:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is pierced.
Then put a little crushed salt or a prepared powder into the wound, and leave it there until the next day; then treat it as needed until it is healed.
And if the nail isn't sensitive and you can't insert the needle, or it isn't embedded in the nail bed, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines and healed as described in the division.
And if you wish to incise it, then you should open the patient's wound and take a sharp, fine lion's spatula, shaped like this: with subtlety. And if sometimes it is inflamed and congested and penetrates into the tissue, then distil from your flask into the wound a prepared powder, or rose-colored ointment, or crushed salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on that area until everything that is affecting it is removed, otherwise, a hot abscess forms in the wound, in which case you leave it alone and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
Then repeat your operation on that area with reason until it is healed.
If the tear duct swells up in the wound, causing significant harm, it should be suspended with a compress; and you cut it open from one side, but do not continue the incision so that you do not cause a flow of tears.
Then instill into the tear duct rose-colored ointment and prepared powder until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of a boil and of that which is born of inflamed flesh in the wound.
Sometimes in the wounds of some, red flesh grows, and it spreads until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or constricts the eyelids, and tightly presses the eyelids together at the edges, resembling the roughness of a balustrade.
But the operation on him is that the patient rests his head on your lap; then open the wounds of that [affected area] and collect all that flesh with appropriate forceps, and hold it with a pair of forceps or with this; and then cut the flesh from the beginning until everything is finished with the scalpel, and be careful not to damage the wound during your operation.
And your incision should be performed with the scalpel which we have described in the incision of the fingernail, or with small forceps with which the flesh is gathered according to the form that will appear in this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, then fill the wound with powdered salt, or apply red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a bandage over the wound with egg white until it is safe from a suppurating boil.
And if any cause of suppuration remains and a hot blood clot is present, and you fear a suppurating boil, then leave the wound and treat that boil with whatever will cause it to subside, and then repeat the operation on that [area] until it is healed; and similarly, do the same for any flesh that adheres to the wound of this type.
But nevertheless, you should avoid any treatment of the wound through a natural or accidental path, working with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the limb is enduring the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus in the wound.
Pus comes from red veins which are hardened over the wound and prevent its healing, and the wound needs to be treated over a long period of days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the wound in which there is pus is strong and contains no other illness besides pus, then you collect that pus.
And you command the patient to place their head on your lap, and then restrain those veins with one or two ounces, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of a subtle duplication according to this form:
or two ounces gradually in one place according to this form:
And then gather those veins with subtle force, subtly, and wipe away the blood gradually until you see those veins have shrunk back into the wound and have closed up.
And be careful not to injure the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so as not to cut anything except those veins.
And when you have finished, then you instill into the wound either green or red juice so that, with its sharpness, it corrodes what has shrunk back from the flesh.
But if that is not possible for you, gather everything at that time, and then you plaster it with what relieves his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is relieved and the inflammation has subsided.
And then repeat the same procedure until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nasal fracture.
When you treat a fractured nose with cautery or a sharp, burning medicine, after the initial treatment has failed, you should not rely on it, but make an incision over the abscess, as it matures.  Remove all moisture and pus until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness there, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the shape:
And it is called a "rough head," and it is made of iron.  The head is round, like a grip, and is made pointed by filing or smoothing with a fine file (as in the following illustration).
And place that on the corrupted area of the bone.  Then, rotate it between your fingers, and gently press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this is done several times, then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated, good flesh has grown there, the body is free of pus, and it remains for 40 days without re-opening, becoming inflamed, or suffering any accidents, then you know it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a genuine healing, but rather a reduction of the fissure to the shape of a nose, in this manner:  And this is how: You expose the underlying bone with iron or a sharp medicine, and once the bone is exposed, then you take a tribo (a small piece of bone?) in this manner:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and the shaft be thin and tapered down to the tip, like this (a description of a shape or tool).
Then place that (the iron/instrument) on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand a little further away, and then rotate your hand with the tribo until it pierces the entire bone, and the patient feels air escaping when you move your hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent, drying medicines, as I have taught you.
So, when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter which had spread outwards returns to the nose, thus making it easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the prominence of the eye socket.
When the eye socket protrudes completely and you do not encounter any harmful or diminishing swelling, then you should leave the patient alone and subsequently follow it, and then apply leeches to the neck without incision, and have them suck well; and then apply a liniment made of atra, aloe, and incense, and sarcocolla to the eye socket, and then press the poultice onto the eye socket with fine powders.
And the method for the powders is to take very fine linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make many of these.
And then place those layers one on top of the other according to the amount the eye socket requires. And then press on those with a firm cloth with strong pressure; and repeat the leech application with suction without incision; and then remove the leeches and leave the eye socket compressed day and night.
But if meanwhile the swelling is softened, then it should be compressed very tightly.
And then remove the compress approximately day and night as we have said.
And if the eye socket has already been reduced, good; but if not, then repeat the plaster with powders, compression, and leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protrudes from the eyelids like a bunch of grapes, and the form of a person is damaged by this, and you wish to incise it, then the operation there is as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then place another needle with double thread on the tear duct side, and make that one penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then cut the place with the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle, and hold it firmly.
Then remove the needle and place over the socket wool soaked in egg white, and leave it until the thread with the grape comes out.
And then treat the socket with this, which will comfort it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, one gathers from all sides with a cloth circle to hold a large protruding swelling in the socket, and then it is pierced with a fine instrument that reaches the front of the socket, and the white-ish moisture runs out, and the socket subsides and immediately goes in.
And then hold it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of alconati.
This illness, called alconati, is nothing more than a fluid that has collected in the socket, similar to descending water, but it is not actually that.
But the method of treatment is that you should have the sick person sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take their head in your two hands and hold it firmly until you see the fluid coming to the lower parts, and then it should be dried and not descend, and the light should be stopped, and the sick person should see the causes just as they were seeing them.
And if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid is not prepared with what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands, and then take a thin, fine spittle and apply it to the conjunctiva, a little bit near the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea, in the crown (into the hollow), until the fluid is expelled.
Therefore, when it is expelled, then you pour warm water into the socket in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already described the types of water in the division, and which ones need to be pierced with a lancet, explaining the reason, then according to the health of the patient.
Then you should place the patient between your hands on a bed and firmly compress their eye.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye with the water is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then place the tip of the almond close to the eyebrow, across the width of the eye in the white part of the eye near the smaller tear duct, and then press the almond with force and turn your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has now reached the empty space.
And it is necessary that the distance traveled by the almond be equal to the space from the pupil to the edge of the dark area, which is the brow of the eye; for you will see with that pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond into the location where the fluid is, and then pull it down several times, and therefore if the fluid descends immediately, then you see the patient doing so with their eyes immediately, and the almond in their eye.
And then rest it a little; therefore, if the fluid has descended, then you pause again before the almond is discarded.
And thus, when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently rub it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the fluid and wash the eye with it; and then apply to the eye a cloth or bandage or wool soaked in warmed oil and egg white, and bandage the eye with this.
However, we and those of our time use a thin layer of egg white over that wound.
And if you cannot insert your almond into the eye due to its hardness—because some people's eyes are very hard—then you must take the substance called *alberid*, which is of this form:
And then pierce that joint with it, and do not insert your hand into the hole, but rather make a subtle passageway for the almond.
And then insert the almond, as we have said.
And after completing your work, the patient should be prepared in a well-made bedchamber, where they sleep on their back in a dark room, and all movement is prohibited.
And place this on their body so that their nature is soothed, and do not turn their head to either the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain according to its placement until the third day.
And then, remove it from that dark room and take away the distracting sight, show them some things, and then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the hours of treatment or immediately after the infusion. Having done this, you should remove it because water can easily flow away with great and violent rinsing.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the dressing before the seventh day and treat it with whatever will cause the abscess to yield.
Then, you remove the patient's sight and place a compress on their face over which their vision is directed downwards for several days, while they remain in the dark room.
And then gradually release them from that room and return them to their activities.
And know that in a serious illness, the patient is not excused from occasional observation, and then you will be bold in your approach to the operation.
And it has come to our knowledge that some of those who were at Artach, and some said that a fire was made in the Ayrac, a large hole, through which water was drawn.
However, I myself have not seen anyone in our land who has successfully done this, nor is it written in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of magdaam [or "medicaments"] so that the one who is ignorant of them might understand them:
And they are made of earth or iron, properly, and their extremities are with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end thus, as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When in the nose diverse growths of flesh arise, some of which have a cause similar to a scorpion's stinger or to a polypus; and this illness is called a polypus because it is similar in appearance to that fish. And from it comes cancerous, ulcerated flesh, of a dark color; and from it comes leonine flesh, not of dark color.
Therefore, in those flesh growths that are not fraudulent or cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, and open the patient's nostrils, and prick those flesh growths with your lancet. And then extract that to the exterior, and then separate what you have grasped of those with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any part of it from which excision is possible remains, then you sever that with a thin instrument with ease until no part of it remains. But if it is accompanied by blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize it until the blood is removed and all the cavities are cleared.
And then put a sharp, sour substance, vinegar or wine, into the nose. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that within it is flesh mixed with excessive pus on the bones of the nose to which the excision has not reached.
Therefore, you should introduce a thick piece of lead, and place several pieces, with a distance between each piece of the width of a finger or less.  Bind the patient, and introduce one end of the lead into the nose with a probe, or with any other instrument available.
And after that is done, draw the smell inward until it reaches the nostrils, and it comes out over his throat, for troops of children often do the similar things in schools, and it is an easy task for one who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the lead, one end emerging from the nose and the other remaining inside, and then apply a flesh-removing tool using the pieces of lead, and do this until you see that the flesh is now with the pieces of lead.
Then remove the lead, and place a cauterization tool near the nose, in the area where you removed the blood, and do this for three days or more until the medicine completely corrodes any remaining flesh.
And finally, place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals.
But if you need a more potent cure, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument for nasal purging, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or brass, which should resemble a small, open lamp, or a small shell, and the opening should be similarly shaped.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and the tube of the nasal purging instrument should be flat, open; with a handle at its back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water, or whatever juices and subtle substances you want.
Chapter 25.
Of the oils applied to the nostrils.
Often oil is applied to the nostrils, and it is used and increased over several days until the condition is significantly improved.
And therefore, you should address it at the beginning of its appearance, and remove everything completely. And then place a cautery or a burning medicine on the area.
However, if its treatment is delayed until it has worsened, consider if it is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive.  If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a hardened abscess; because often the one who cuts into this abscess will cause great harm to the person it affected.
If the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and incision is possible throughout, then drain the patient and cut into it without fear, and treat the area with what dries and tightens it until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suture of the nose, lips, and ear when the continuity is broken by plague or similar affliction.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, little is gained in that operation, except in skilled hands.
Therefore, when encountering such a cause, consider whether it is fresh plague with its blood, and if so, you should join the two sides of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the broken skin are already separated and each is made whole, then you must scrape each part of their surrounding skin until blood is no longer present. And then join the two edges with sutures, tightening them, and powder them with dragon's blood and crushed herbs. Place a piece of diaphanous plaster, or another consolidating plaster, over the powder. Leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it and replace the plaster.  Leave it until the pus is completely gone, then treat with ointment until healed.
But the method of suturing is that you join the break either with needles, as we have described in suturing the belly, or with pus, as you have been taught.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things that come between the two lips in the inner parts.
Often, in the inner parts of their lips, some men develop hard abscesses resembling boils, and some of these are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you must turn back the lips and cut away each of those hardnesses from all sides, and then fill the space with pressed lint until the blood is stopped, and then wash the area with sour wine and treat it with something astringent until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, there are fleshy growths on the gum, which the ancients called "albulus".  Therefore, you should detach it with forceps or scissors, and cut it at its base, and let the pus or blood run.
And then place pressed lint or other styptic or drying powders on the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, for the cautery will not return it.
Chapter 29.
Concerning teeth with a file/iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both on the inner and outer parts and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes black and yellowish or greenish coatings form, which cause a corruption of the gum and make the teeth hard.
Therefore, you must place the patient between your hands, rest their head on your lap, and file the teeth where those coatings and similar things, like grit, appear, until no residue of them remains, and do this to remove the blackness, yellowness, and other discolorations until they are cleaned.
So if you have removed what was on them at the beginning of the filing process, good.  Otherwise, you repeat the filing process on those areas on the next day, and then the second and third, until you arrive at the desired state.
And know that teeth require many filings of various shapes and forms, according to what your operation requires. And therefore, the file used to file the inner part of the tooth is different from the file used to file between the teeth in other ways, and these different types of files should be prepared by you, which you will see shortly.
Chapter 30.
Of the eradication of teeth.
You must cure the tooth of its pain with all your skill and be thorough in every eradication, for there is no cause that can compensate for its loss once it is extracted, since it is a valuable substance until it is removed during extraction.
However, when the patient insists on having a tooth extracted, you must be absolutely certain which tooth is causing the pain, for frequently the pain deceives the patient and seems to be in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted. For we have often seen this from the experience of barbers.
Therefore, how should you be certain which is the painful tooth, and that you know it well?  Then you must make incisions around the tooth with a substance containing some virtue, until it has dissolved the tooth from the gum on every side, and then gently remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little until it is loosened.
And then, if necessary, use large strong pliers for good leverage or firm grip, and place the patient's head between your knees, holding it well so it doesn't move, and then pull the tooth straight, in a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient further pain.
And therefore, if it is not easily extracted, then take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth on all sides with ease, and forcefully remove it, just as you did initially.
However, if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you must cover the crack with cloth and press it with a thin, sharp instrument so that it is not broken when you use pliers to remove it.
And you must carefully make incisions around the gum on all sides, and carefully control your strength so you don't break the tooth, and keep a piece of it, and return to the patient with the injury being worse than the original pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their eagerness and boldness in extracting teeth, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in people that are more difficult to cure, and leave the roots of the teeth all or some of them remaining, or extract them with some of the jawbone, as we have often witnessed.
And after the extraction, rinse the mouth with hot wine or vinegar with salt.
And if blood flows from this, as often happens, then apply a small amount of alum and sprinkle it over the wound; and if that doesn't stop it, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers with which the tooth is initially grasped should be long at the tip, with a short, thick handle, so they don't bend when using them.
And they should be like this, with thick handles until, when you grip them, they don't bend; the tips should be short.
And they should be made of well-forged Indian iron, with straight tips, and on the tips of these are teeth that interlock with one another and grip with strong constriction; and sometimes the tips of these are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, that is, a crane, and they have strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the extraction of teeth and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
When, for the extraction of a broken tooth, some cause remains, then you should place a cloth with a compress on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; then, insert forceps or pliers whose tips are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or crane, the shape of the forceps.
The tips of them should be made smooth like a file or a whetstone.
And if you do not succeed in this way with these forceps or pliers, then you must cut into the root and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument called a small lever, whose shape is this:
And it should be of short length, thick at the end, and not be blunt, so as not to break.
Therefore, if the root is thus forced out, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument is triangular at the end, of which there should be some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and have a more slender end.
And you are already helped with this instrument having two ramps, whose shape is roughly the following: and with other instruments, which I will describe further regarding tooth extraction; for extraction is done with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, and this is the form:
of a triangular, bent or short end, which should have some thickness, and should not be hollow so that it does not break.
And you should also know that the instruments for teeth are very similar to the other instruments.
But the skillful and subtle craftsman in the art, himself finds, according to what the operation and diverse illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe or prescribe a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or if they are loose, then the fracture should be held in place with whatever is appropriate from the instruments and forceps mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and assist with the gesture of which this is the form:
And there should be some small, gradual pressure, and it should be compressed or held with the mouth so that it does not burst or escape until the bone is completely set; and then restore the area with suitable medicines for this.
But if there is a small inflammation on the bone, then remove that inflammation and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth that protrude beyond the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural position due to irregular growth, especially in women, and particularly in young women, you must consider: if a tooth is close to another and a filling or ligature is not possible, then remove it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument which has the shape of a pig's snout, made of very sharp Indian iron.
And the incision you make should be gradual over several days, because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not damage the other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And it should be entirely of Indian iron, easily sharpened; and it should have many small points, like the file used to make needles, with which the tooth should be filed gradually over several days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then, finally, line it [the tooth] and remove its roots with some razors.
And if a part of the tooth is broken and the tongue is injured, then you must file it until the roughness of the fracture is removed and smoothed, and made even so that the tongue is not injured and the speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver filings.
When teeth are damaged by concussion and removal through impact or striking, and the patient cannot hold what is missing, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then, because they do not decay, gold filings are used in those that are held together, and not silver, for silver turns green and can become rotten in a few days, but gold never changes.
And the filings should be of such fineness and size as to fit between the teeth; and the method of application is to take the filings and place double the amount between two healthy teeth, and then to work them with two twists of the filings between the broken teeth, or if there is one or more, until the substance reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the process until you reach the point where you started, and apply pressure with ease and skill until the tooth is no longer broken.
And make sure your grip with which you hold the filings is firm against the roots of the teeth so that they do not fall out.
Then trim the excess filings with forceps or scissors, and carefully place them in each gap, fitting them and concealing them between the healthy and broken tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus firmly fixed in place.
However, if it is loose or broken, secure it or them with more filings in a similar manner at all times.
And this is the method for teeth and the manner of restoring two healthy teeth and two broken ones, thus connecting them together:
And when it is done, return a tooth or two to its proper position, and they are restored as we have described, and remain fixed.
And only skilled and knowledgeable artisans can do this.
And sometimes, a piece of cow bone is prepared in the shape of a tooth, and placed in the gap where the tooth is missing, secured as we have said, and it remains and serves in that place for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the ligature of the ligament that affects the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which sometimes lies beneath the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a wound that has healed.
And the procedure for it is to open the patient's mouth, their head resting on your lap;  lift their tongue, and then carefully cut that nervous ligament along its length until the tongue is freed from its restriction.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting there, due to the healing of a wound, then you apply a cautery and sever that along its length until you have cut the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful not to create a tear in the flesh and to avoid cutting too deeply and causing a flow of blood.
And then wash the incision with water or sour wine or cold water;  and then place a linen pad under the tongue;  this is a pad which the patient will hold under their tongue every night to prevent it from re-adhering.
But if a flow of blood occurs, apply powdered vitriol to the area; however, if the bleeding continues, then cauterize the area with a smooth cautery appropriate for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula (a cyst) under the tongue.
Sometimes, a boil resembling a small tumor forms under the tongue, hindering its natural function, and it grows large, filling the mouth.
And the treatment for it is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the abscess.
And if you see it of a dark color or black, hard, to which the patient feels no sensation, then do not touch what is a cancer.
And if it has become whitish, in which there is moisture, then you put a lancet on it, and cut it with a thin knife, and sever it from every part; and if blood comes out during your operation, then you place on it crushed glass, that is, verdigris, until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it has been washed with sharp wine and salt; and treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of an abscess in two ears, and of one that is on the throat, and of other abscesses.
When there is an abscess on the throat, meaning glands that are gathered together, which burst and are called two ears, when you treat them with what we have said in the division and it is not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, of dark color, and with little sensation; then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is of reddish color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron for the flow of blood; first let it ripen, and then either you will lance it, or it will burst on its own.
And if it is of white color, smooth, and its root is subtle, then that is what needs to be incised.
And the operation on it is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested, fully resting, or if it has diminished with any diminution; and then make the sick person sit facing the sun, and their head should be on your lap, and open their mouth, and the attendant should take between their hands, press the patient's tongue down with a very fine instrument, whose shape is this:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and as thin as a knife.
So, as you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and you place your attention on it, then take an ounce and place it in the incision, and pull it out to the sides as much as you can. After this, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut it with an instrument of this shape:
After this, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut it with an instrument of this shape: and it is similar to forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each one is opposite the other, very sharp, made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a spatula of this shape:  And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one side, cut the other according to this same method of incision, and after the incision, the patient will be cured of the cold.
However, if bleeding occurs, stop it with a decoction of pomegranate bark or myrtle leaf, or similar astringent remedies, until the bleeding is controlled.  Then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the neck or near those two ears, and cut these according to what I have described in the incision of two sides (incisions).
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had developed in her throat, an abscess tending toward a dark color, with little sensation.  It had already constricted her throat, and she was breathing with difficulty, and she had been forbidden food and water, and she was close to death if she had been without treatment for another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had created two channels (or fistulas) before it finally broke through two openings.
Therefore, I treated it surgically, inserting a knife into one of them, and pulled it out, and a large portion was pulled out. Then I incised the opening where I could reach from the other opening, then I opened the patient's mouth and held their tongue down, and then I inserted the knife into the abscess.
And then I excised a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was cleared, and she soon began drinking water, and then eating solid food.  So I continued to repeatedly incise the abscess over a long period, and a new abscess would form in place of the previous one, which I incised until it eventually healed.
So I cauterized the woman's throat, which was effective; and then I walked away, not knowing what God had wrought through me.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision of a boil when it is abscessed.
When a catarrh forms on the uvula, and it is abscessed and protracted, then it is called a perpendicular boil; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a bubo.
However, when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and you do not confirm your cure, and sometimes the already healed abscess is still present and subtle, then you must incise the one that is round and thick; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, dark or black, and it is not in the center, then you should consider the incision, for there is fear of harm to the patient.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, make the patient sit up and press his tongue with an instrument which demonstrates its shape, and then insert a probe into the cavity and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments described in the incision of two boils.
And you must not incise anything except what is properly located on the natural boundary without further additions, for if you incise more than that, you will impair its speech.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of two boils, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the patient is frightened by the incision, you must use cauterization without hesitation, and the method of cauterization is only with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head on your lap, then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and then take the water described in the chapter on cauterization, and apply a live ember to it, and place it, neither thick nor thin, into the concavity of the instrument, which has this shape:
Let the end of it [the instrument] be concave, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine over the uvula.  The patient should lie on their side so that any saliva or mucus from the mouth flows down the medicine, to prevent any matter from dropping into their throat and irritating it.
And then, hold your hand with the medicine and press it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it blackened and subdued by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and immerse the cloth in the medicine.  Insert the spoon with the cloth into a tube or sheath until the cloth adheres to it. Repeat this process until you achieve your desired cauterization of the uvula.  Then allow it to dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  Afterwards, clean the area around the uvula with cloth soaked in water, removing any remnants of the medicine.  Wash the area with cool water, and apply external remedies, and internal treatments until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less prone to fear/danger.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cauterization or incision, by fumigation in this way: take balm, hyssop, rue, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, marigold and similar herbs, combine all or some of these in a pot, and submerge them in vinegar, and boil them; the pot must be well sealed, and a hole should be placed in the middle of the pot, over which is placed a concave brass instrument like this; it should be made of silver or brass.
And the end should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula, covering it completely.
And then repeat this several times until it is dry.  Be careful not to use this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, as it would spread the abscess, and you should only do this after the abscess has been properly identified as such.
But if you do not have this instrument, then take a cane and place a hard-boiled egg shell on its end, so the patient's mouth is covered, as the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the extraction of thorns and of that which adheres to the throat, and of other causes.
Many times thorns or fish bones or some other thing adhere to the throat.
Therefore, you must remove whatever of those is apparent, upon which you fix your gaze, since you press the tongue with an instrument in front of a light, so that what is in the throat is revealed to you.
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for a thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or make the patient swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or have the patient take a piece of dry sea sponge, and bind it tightly with a cloth, and then the patient swallows this, for as it reaches the place where the thorns are, it is expelled. And further, take an eel and drink it with a cloth tied around it, and it be put inside and quickly be taken out; or take a leek and quickly put it in and quickly pull it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this way:
And let it be larger than a fingernail, and at its end be a cavity which you can easily insert into their throat.
And have them raise their head, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so as to avoid causing them discomfort, and with this you push against the bone or thorn, or the physician pushes with their hand.
But rather, let the patient themselves intervene, because of their knowledge of the location of the cause, and push it downwards, and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount which has been prepared for them, until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When a bloodsucker is treated with what we have described in the section on healing with medicines and not by force, then consider the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed the patient's tongue with the instrument we have described to you.
Therefore, if you see the bloodsucker, extract it with a small knife or with delicate, proper movements.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this many times (until the bloodsucker is dead and detaches from the throat) and keep the patient away from water all day.
Then take a bowl full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth into it, and rinse the mouth with it; and let the patient not swallow anything and hold the water with your hand for an hour, because the bloodsucker, as soon as it feels the water, will detach.
But if it is not expelled by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with incense or asafoetida using the instrument we described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall away.
And there is another method of fumigation for this, which is that you take a dish in which there are burning coals, and the dish is covered with a cover in the middle of which is a hole, and the tip of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then apply the fumigation; and the patient should place their mouth on the tip of the cannula and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, because the bloodsucker will immediately fall off.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and have them eat salty things and herbs, and do not let them drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is treated from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, but there is a slight curvature in it. which is placed on the throat, and its tip is like a stork's beak, which is made of leather, and which is sharpened with a file, so that when we grasp any thing, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many kinds, in many ways, according to the recollection of them, each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their puncturing and incision in two ways, of which one is due to the nature of the abscess itself; and the other to the presence of moisture.
And the second way is according to the locations in the body where they occur, for the abscess that occurs in the head is different from the abscess that occurs in the buttocks; and the abscess in fleshy areas is different from the abscess in a joint; and for each of them, there is its own judgment for treatment.
And some abscesses should not be opened until the pus has matured within them or until they have reached their full development.
Other abscesses should be lanced when they are inflamed and have not matured to their full potential, such as abscesses near joints. For an abscess near a joint, its development extends until it spreads to the surrounding area, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, thus causing the contraction of that limb; or if the abscess is near a vital organ, delaying lancing until it matures might damage that vital organ; or if it is near the rectum, then lancing it while it's not fully matured is appropriate.  Do not lance a raw, incompletely developed abscess, but one near the rectum should be lanced before it spreads too far into the rectum and becomes a fistula, or causes lasting damage in that area. However, you must know the time for lancing the abscess, and that is when it is mature.
And you know it is mature when there is a decrease in pain and fever, and a decrease in swelling and throbbing, and a clarity to the abscess head, and the other signs.
And you must know to lance the abscess in the area with the most pus, and coming from the treatment of the swelling.
And always lance along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the limbs or feet, and not near the tendons, nerves, or blood vessels; and otherwise, in all similar areas where there is no reflection; for those that reflect, use lancing according to that specific limb.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave the lancing until the digestion within is confirmed, as we have said; for if you lance it before that, the body's course of the matter within and much impurities are prolonged, and the abscess's edges become hardened and deepen.
But some abscesses are lanced according to the width of the flesh or body, depending on the need, or according to what the limb requires.
And you should administer a small incision for small abscesses, and a large and wide one, or multiple incisions, for large abscesses, depending on their size.
And others are abscesses in which the pus-filled area should be hollowed out and cut open, when done like this and it is at a point where it is already suppurating, like that which occurs in boils and buboes.
And some are incised with a three-angled cut; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the groin.
And some of them are given a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar to those.
But for those that are not like that, for example superficial abscesses, you should make a superficial or flat incision only.
And when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, you should pierce it and not try to remove all the pus at once; having removed a portion, close the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and do this repeatedly according to a gradual increase until it is fully drained.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly and decrepit person, because the animal spirit is often weakened by the discharge of pus, and the patient often dies quickly, and you should be cautious in treating them.
Observe this chapter with great caution, and for your incision into these abscesses, you should clean the sores and then consider whether the abscess wound is small, or a simple incision, in which case you apply dressings of lint or old cloth.  But if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the incision are numerous, then you should place medicaments in each opening until they come together.
And if, in the abscess, a portion of the skin has been severed or you have hollowed it out around the edges, then you should fill it with old cloth or thread made from linen, in the same way as when you have extracted stones or splinters, without moisture; and bind it until the third day.  Then you should continue to treat it and care for it with appropriate remedies until it is healed.
But if you encounter a bleeding during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar to a linen cloth, and place this over the bleeding spot repeatedly.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer a regimen and treatment, using the powders mentioned in many places in this book and in the section on [specific methods or divisions within the book].
However, if it is wintertime and the area of the abscess is located near many nerves, then you should infuse powders in warm wine and oil, and place these over the affected areas.
And if it is summertime, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, and all of this should be kept cool until the third day, as we have said.  Then you should drain the abscess, cleanse it, and administer the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary regarding the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses in general; however, according to the method of distinction I have already mentioned, the method of treatment for each type of abscess is explained in separate chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses that arise on the scalp.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are often in the form of nodes that contain membranes that are attached to them; and their substances are various.
And some of them contain a sticky, lime-like moisture. And some contain a moisture resembling dust, and similar to those; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as their extraction does not cause a contrary arching.
And the surgical procedure for their incision is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is similar to this, called a probe, until you know what they contain.
For if what it contains is moisture, then you divide it with an incision lengthwise, by a superficial incision following this form:
And begin the incision at line B to line G.  Then, when the moisture is evacuated, you scrape the skin that contained the moisture, and leave no cause of it, for many times it returns if any cause remains.
Then, soak some cotton in Egyptian ointment, if available, or else in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, for with this you corrode whatever remains of the skin.
And then repeatedly apply Egyptian ointment to the cotton a second and third time, if necessary, until you are confident that no part of the skin remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty lumps, then you incise it according to this form: with an incision shaped like a cross, and place hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your skill in removing the layer that contains it.
But if your efforts encounter resistance, then do as I previously described.
And similarly, treat the calcified abscess with incision and treatment as we have described; and incision on a calcified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are on the head in some men, from which there is no moisture; the reason for this is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken, and if someone were struck with it, it would hurt.
But in other accidental abscesses on the head, this is not this topic, such as the abscesses that occur on the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, but the incision of all these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation in the lowest part of those, so that the body's pus is relieved to the lower parts.
And then treat them with what is appropriate for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas (swellings) that occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck, armpits, and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur on the neck, and many are generated within their own tissue (or skin), and every such scrofula is within its own proper tunic, and just as with the swellings and abscesses of the head, as we have already recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for among them are some hard or stony ones, and among them are those that contain moisture, and among them are malignant ones that do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that one which you find to be well-disposed by palpation, of which the visible color is similar to that of a boil, and is soft in all directions, and is not attached to the neck's nerves, veins, or arteries, and is not hard, you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper to the lower part of the body from line G to line B, and lance it on every side, and extend the edges of the boil with forceps, or with many forceps if necessary, as we described for abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve is not cut.
And if the inflammation is not very acute, do not apply your hand with an incision, or disturb the patient, and do not cut what is unnecessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and hinder your procedure, then put powdered vitriol or other powders that stop the flow of blood on the wound, and compress the wound, and leave it until the inflammation subsides and the wound softens and begins to decay. When the blood is drawn off.
Therefore, return to your procedure until you have completed it.
And then examine with your index finger if there are any other small causes of scrofulas, then cut and clean those.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the scrofuła, it is necessary then not to cut that scrofuła from its roots. Before that, you should tie that with a strongly folded cloth and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
And then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian unguent, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scrophula, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them up as soon as there is no more excess fluid.
But if you see that there is excess fluid due to the size of the scrophula, it is necessary that you intend to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and administer stitches and what is said (i.e., the previous treatments).
And that of the scrofulas which contain moisture, pierce it with a superficial incision where you see the location of its maturation, and place the incision so that the pus goes down to the lowest part of the body, just as we have said.
And then administer some incisions, perhaps with unguents and similar to those, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleaned, then you treat it with a healing unguent until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the boil of an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients spoke of this incision on the boil, but no one in our land has ever seen it done.
And this is the record of the saying of those people.
However, in people with back pain, the removal of the boil should be avoided, as it will not bring improvement because all the veins and major organs of the sick person are there.
But in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the windpipe, one should use the incision of the boil to avoid the harm caused by burning.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the boil below three or four small circles around the boil, with the incision being in the area between two circles, in a wedge shape, not on the cartilage.  This place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is afraid, then he should extend the throat's membrane with a wedge, and then split the membrane until he reaches the channel, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any reason to.
And then, he should incise the wedge as we have described; and the incision of the channel is signified by the pus that exits, along with what is broken from it, and by the cessation of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time has passed during which perforation is feared, bring together the two flaps of the wound's membrane, and stitch them together, leaving out the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the procedure we have described, in essence, is that you will see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's airway, and the patient has come close to death; and the patient's breathing is cut off.  Some attempt to cut the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the area of the wound for some breathing, and thus be saved from death.
And therefore I command to leave the wound open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I command to stitch the wound and treat it until it is healed.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and put it into her throat and cut a part of her lung's airway with it.  I was called to treat her, and I found her breathing like the breathing of the dying. I discovered the wound, and found little blood that had come from the wound.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming from the wound, and I treated her until she was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant if it were not because of a problem in her voice, and after a few days, she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the case of epilepsy there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Of the incision on an abscess that occurs in the throat area, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is in two ways, for either it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental case is in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty lumps, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the blockage of an artery, and in that case, there is fear. And one should not use an iron cauterization on it except in the case of a small one. And you should test it and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it as you would with other tumors, and remove what contains it from the skin and tissues; and if not, then the entire nature of it should be explored, and then treat the area with the necessary treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already discussed all their types in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount the difference between a tumor and a boil, as doubt may arise.
Thus I say that with a boil there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the excess fluid is calmed; and when putrefaction is complete, the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a tumor there is no heat, fever, nor pain, and it resembles that lion's paw which is in the proper pouch.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a blister and is made thus like a vein, whether larger or smaller, and are of two types, for either it is fatty and contains moisture, and the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you should first probe it and investigate it with an instrument called a "intromes," as its form will be described in the chapter which comes after this one.
And it is a method of investigating abscesses and all tumors, and it is that you should take this instrument and insert it into the moistest area you find in the abscess, and you should slowly rotate the instrument until you know that it has penetrated the skin.
Then, finally, place your hand over the abscess according to its size, and then remove the instrument and consider what is left on the instrument's residue.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you should incise it superficially, as I have described in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture on the instrument's residue, then you know that it is fatty.
And dry it with an incision in the shape of a cross, according to this form: So, as I have taught you, and suspend it with hooks, and scrape away the skin from everywhere easily, and if possible keep the skin or sac over it and remove the pus with a probe.
But if it breaks during the operation, it's not possible to remove that pus, and often this happens, and then you should remove it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if any part, little or much, remains, the probe will return again.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders, compress the wound, and place a hot poultice over it, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, then you sew the two edges of it together and treat it with what causes it to heal.
But if a pulsating or non-pulsating vein is near it, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed alum (or vitriol) and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound closes and the blood's boiling subsides; and then return to dissecting what remains of the wound.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
Of those, there are three types of instruments, some large, some medium-sized, and some small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
Let them be made of iron, or bronze, with smoothly rounded ends, so that they may easily enter abscesses.
And these are the forms of the experienced surgeons, and they are called "albereds", and one of them is called a "berid".
And it is of three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large instrument, its shape:
The form of the medium instrument, its shape:
The form of the small instrument, its shape:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses and boils and fistulas and buboes, because among them are some of the bones and other things.
And they are made round, thick, stout, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and are made of citrus wood, or of other wood, or of iron, or of silver.  And the best are those made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are believed to be used to open fistulas in whose cavities are reflections, which are reflected by their lightness against those reflections.
And they come in three varieties, for some are long, and others are medium-length, and others short, according to the size of the fistula and the constriction within it.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium-sized lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the probes are of various types, for some are simple, having only a single curve, and there are three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are also probes without handles, and they are of three types.
And of those there are probes with two curves, and they are of three types.
And of them there are those with three curves, and they are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple probe, its form:
Form of a large probe having two curves: Form of a medium-sized probe having two curves: Form of a small probe having two curves:
Form of a large probe having three curves:
Form of a medium-sized probe having three curves:
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and lanced, and there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium-sized scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The ends with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are blunt, and they are not positioned in such a way, but so that the incision of the nodes is carefully done, avoiding the risk of cutting a vein or nerve, and with that, the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility due to the cauterization that occurs near the incision of the abscess.
And these are the forms of lancets, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They should be made of iron, and should be similar in shape to a reed, with which alcohol is made.
And it is on the pointed end concealed with a small blade, and in it run channels on the inside and outside, as you wish, as you see.
The forms of small blades, which are hidden amongst the fingers, close to the opening of the abscesses, and are not perceived by the patients, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of leeches, with which the flow of blood is drawn, are of three types: large, medium, and small; the forms of them are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and are thin/slender.
And it is necessary that these types of leeches, large, medium, and small, be used so that the blood flow is drawn quickly when necessary, and this is initially not a treatment for the illness.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, breasts, belly, and knees, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments similar to the skins of bladders are made in this form, through which blood is drawn when performed by phlebotomy, or through the incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of male breasts that have grown like those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen during sleep, as they begin to grow hair, and the breasts swell and resemble those of women, becoming like inflamed, suppurating sores.
And whoever observes this, should make incisions on those breasts in a lunar shape, from line B to line G, then remove all the swelling, then fill the wound with a flesh-colored medicine, then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until healed.
But if the breast droops and is softened by its size, as it would be in women, then it should be cut in two its upper parts, with two lunar-shaped incisions, each contained within the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller, following the shape of line B and line G.  Then remove the excess flesh between the edges of the wound, and drain away the fat.  Then, use the suture and powders we've described for the cure, doing whatever is necessary for the healing until it is sound.
And if you do not complete the incision that needs to be made due to the patient's discomfort or bleeding, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes away the remaining fat, then treat it until healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses that arise beneath the skin.
These abscesses that arise beneath the skin are a type of scrofulous, hard swelling, containing a pouch-like membrane.
And some of them contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, following this figure: from line G to line B.  And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you should fill it with old lint and leave it until the next day.
And then the lint should be removed, and the wound treated with an appropriate ointment until healed.
And if the abscess is of the type associated with nodes or scrofulous swellings, then you should make an incision on it just as we described in the section on scrofulous swellings previously.
If the ulcer has spread so that it may bleed, then apply cauterization to it as previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses arising from arrow wounds or vein wounds.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the clot that forms over it consolidates, many times an abscess results.  And the signs by which you know that inflammation and abscess are from the artery or vein: for when an abscess is from an arrow wound it is usually located further from the surface of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a creaking sound in it.
And that which is from a vein is round and close to the surface of the body.
And incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in those located under the armpits, in the elbows, in the neck, and many other places on the body; and if it is large, it is necessary to avoid its treatment with iron.  And those on the extremities or the head should be avoided.
However, for those originating from inflammation of the arrow wound's opening, make a lengthwise incision into the clot.  Then widen the incision with forceps and remove the arrow, and free it from the tissues until it is exposed.
And then insert a needle and drive it through to the other side, and bind the arrow with a double cord in two places—which I learned in extracting two arrows from the Templars.
And then puncture the area between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood is released, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment to the area where pus has formed until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is caused by a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as possible with the clot, and then insert the needle below the area you held under your hand, and drive it through; and tie it with a double thread until you extract it from the other side, and then bandage the abscess with a strong bandage, as I have instructed you concerning the grapevine bandage, in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will come out, then insert the thread with the needle below the entire abscess, beneath the incision of the first needle, and tie your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until what is in it comes out, then you cut away the excess clot, and leave what is tied there.
Then place a poultice, which you have soaked in wine and oil, on it, and then administer the treatment that is made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that arises from a twisting of the nerves.
Thus, as abscesses occur in the arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured by a blow or by excessive exertion, and by similar causes.
And the most of it is formed in the areas around the ankles or heels, or in any location where joints are damaged.
And it is a serious abscess, and is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in the majority of cases without external signs and when it is tight with violence, the patient feels a similar stupor.
And it is not an abscess collected in the front of the body, and therefore is below the ribs; and it is damaged on all sides and does not extend forward or backward.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be opened with iron, for a strong contraction will likely result.
But that which is on the head or forehead, open with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then take it with forceps and cut it from its roots.
And if it is large, then lift it with forceps, scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess which occurs in the area of the abdomen.
Often, in the abdomens of some people and other parts of their bodies, there appear growths which are called funguses by resemblance to fungi, whose roots are subtle and whose heads are large; and their edges are rolled inwards, and some are small, and some are very large.
And I myself have seen one, and in his belly there were two growths which resembled fungi even more, and there was no difference between them; they were white, with fine roots.
And their edges were turned inward and split open, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore, I incised them and found one weighing eighteen ounces and the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider if the patient is humid, and the color of the growth is white, humid, with fine roots; then you should cut them with a broad blade, and have cauteries at the ready in the fire, for often much blood is expelled during the cutting; and if blood spurts, cauterize that area.
And if the patient is fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster and compress the growth with it, in the manner we have described, and leave it on for two days.
And then adjust the lead strip's tightness; therefore, do not cease pressing the lead firmly onto the growth until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the growth has thick roots, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, especially in one that is on the belly.
However, it is possible for you to incise half of it, and then cauterize that area so it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful that you do not presume to incise a growth that is dark colored, insensitive, and stubbornly resistant to treatment, for that is likely cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to you.
Chapter 52.
Of the treatment of a swelling of the navel.
A swelling of the navel is caused by many things; either by fissures in the abdominal wall, and through these the lining or intestines protrude as in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned, or by trapped air.
However, if it is due to a fissure in the abdominal wall and the protrusion of the lining, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body; and it is painless, and often appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location varies greatly from what we have described, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and it returns; and it is very painful there, and it is much larger than the entrance to the bath and causes a lot of suffering.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is painless and does not recede when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it swollen.
And if it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears with a darkening tinge.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the abscess is serious, large and hard, and it is situated according to a certain quantity (or measure).
But if it is due to wind (flatulence), then the touch of it is painless.
And the treatment in that case is to consider if the swelling near the navel is caused by blood from an arrow wound, or a vein, or by flatulence; then you must refrain from treating it, because there is danger and fear in such cases, as I have shown you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses from arrow wounds and vein injuries.
And if the swelling near the navel is caused by the intestine or the mesentery, then you must tell the patient to hold their breath and be standing upright; then gently probe the area around the navel with a probe, and then have them lean between your hands on their elbows; and then circumscribe the area around the navel where you have marked with the probe with a spatula; and then open the pus to a quarter of the abscess away from the navel using a large surgical spoon; and then bind it around with strong thread or gauze in the manner of proper dressing.
And then drain the middle of the open abscess over the ligament and insert your finger into that opening and look for the intestine; and if you find and hold it by the ligament, then you should gently lift and push the intestine back into the belly cavity.
And if you have found the mesentery, then take it with a surgical spoon; and cut away the excess.
But if it is an arrow wound or vein injury, then circle the wound, and then return to your treatment; and take two needles and put strong thread on them, and insert the two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, driving them through; and then gently press the abscess into four sections over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and allow the open wound to heal and close up on its own; or cut away the tissue when it is softened and can be separated, and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the swelling at the navel is of flesh growing there or due to moisture, then you should drain the abscess as we have described, and remove the blood or moisture which you find there, and then treat it with appropriate remedies to make the area heal.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the different types of cancer and how it is treated with medicine, and that cutting it out with iron is inadvisable because it would cause an ulcer; and we have described the cancer that originates internally and the precautions to take when treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer can be removed from certain locations, like cancer on the breasts or the thighs, and similar areas on the limbs, removing all of it, especially when it is small and newly begun.
However, when it is old and severe, it is not advisable to attempt to remove it completely, for I have not been able to cure such a thing nor have I seen anyone else who has been successful in doing so.
And the procedure for such a location, as we have said, is that you first treat and cleanse the patient of black bile on occasion, and then bleed them if a clear fullness is found.
And then prepare the patient for the procedure, and then insert hooks into the cavity, appropriate to the affected area.  Then, using a suitable gouge, carefully excavate from all sides until no trace of the roots remains. Allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it off lightly.  Express the sites, and cleanse away the thick blood with your hand or an appropriate instrument, as you are able.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood from a vein or artery incision, then cauterize the area until the flow of blood stops, and then treat it with further care until it is healed.
Chapter 145 (or 104.  The Roman numeral 'liv' is not standard for a chapter numbering.)
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy (caused by water), and the symptoms of each type, and the treatment of them with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of "alhitas" alone, and it is not appropriate to use iron for the types of "timpanistes" or "ypo-sarcha," for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanistic dropsy with medicines, and your treatment does not work, then consider: if the patient is already weakened, or has another illness in addition to dropsy, such as in the lungs or abdomen, and similar to those, then beware of treating them with iron, for fear of harm.
But if you see the patient with excessive strength, and it is only dropsy without any other illness, and the patient is not a child nor old, then the method of the operation is that you lift the patient up between your hands, and a servant presses the patient's abdomen with his hand, expelling the water towards the lower part of the stomach, and then takes spittle mixed with the following ingredients:
It should be in two sharp pieces, long, with a sharp tip, like spittle; but nonetheless, let there be a little bit of shortness in it, so that in the operation with it you do not pierce the intestine and damage it.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for in that case, you should, by incision, move away from the navel by about three fingers to the lower parts, to the right side above the stomach.
But if the dropsy originates from a liver ailment, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the left side.
And your incision should not be on the side where the patient is lying, lest the superfluous fluids run to that spot and be retained.
And then pierce the entire membrane with the instrument, and then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the membrane and the skin, and scrape it off; and if it is the thickness of a fingernail or similar.
And then pierce the skin until the spatula reaches the empty space, and it is the space of the water. And then remove that and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: and it resembles a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its end is cut in the manner of a feather, like this:
And at the highest end of it is a small collar, for when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately closes over the instrument, thus evacuating a moderate amount of water, for if you evacuate more than is necessary at that time, the patient will likely die due to resolution of their vital spirit, or it will bring about a quick death.
But evacuate only that amount which is appropriate to its potency and according to the patient's condition, as indicated by their pulse strength and constitution.
And now remove the instrument, and retain the water.  This is because as soon as it is retained by the clasp that closes the hole at the top of the device, remember that you should pierce it in this manner.
And repeat the procedure on another day, if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small amount of water.  Do this for several days, cautiously, and be wary of mistakes until only a little water remains.
However, if you are concerned about the patient and leave behind a large amount of water, then treat it with burial in hot sand, and inducing sweat through a bath, and exposure to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what has gone before.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children born with unperforated urinary passages.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is very narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using very fine instruments, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead peg in the opening, securing it, and keep it in place for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it will be able to urinate; and then remove it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine that collects on the area will not allow this opening to close.
But that from which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
However, in those cases where the opening is not in the proper place, as mentioned, the cause is that those born with the opening towards the end of the penis' head cannot urinate properly, until the penis is raised with the hand in a position above.  It isn't a generative issue, as the semen cannot reach the female in the proper manner, and is a very lengthy ailment.
And the method of treatment in this case is to have the patient lie on their back, and then pull the head of the penis up with your left hand with forceful traction, and cut the head of the foreskin from the area of the prepuce with a sharp scalpel, as if cutting a pen-feather, or whatever tool you use to remove a portion of it.  This is so that the opening of the penis becomes properly aligned with the head of the penis, and the opening is positioned in its proper location.
And be careful during your surgical procedure, as often bleeding occurs; and apply what you use to stop the bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the white discoloration that occurs on the foreskin and head of the penis, and its corruption, darkening, and adhesion to the head of the penis.
Often this white discoloration appears on the penis, and it is a noticeable outgrowth of loose flesh.
And of that one is malignant and the other is not.
For the non-malignant kind, you should suspend it with a fine thread, and cut it away until it is all removed. Then, apply a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment; afterwards, treat it with diaphanous ointment until it is healed.
And if the white discoloration is malignant, with a dark color, then you must apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the white discoloration is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the discoloration is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the discoloration that is inside first until it is healed; then you treat the part outside, for when you treat both at once, there is no guarantee it won't be broken.
And if you see discoloration and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and about to rot or is already rotten.  Then, apply a mixture of honey, ground pomegranate rind, and crushed and sifted herbs to the affected area.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healthy.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
for a beneficial cautery is used in two situations together, that is, for a flow of blood and for a sore when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is completely eroded and destroyed at once, then you should insert a lead cannula into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required for them; and when adhesion occurs due to a sore or abscess), you must scrape with a blunt instrument until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to discern them precisely, then you must scrape away any cause of the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when thin, is easily pierced due to its thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so they do not stick together again.
And then it should be treated with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the purification of children and the treatment of what happens to those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is of our doing and our will, and its purpose is specifically in children, it is necessary to assign the best procedure and the easiest path to recovery.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience that I have found most artisans and barbers use circumcision and purification with a razor and forceps; and they use ligation with thread and incision with the fingernail.
And I have already tried all these methods, and I find no better purification with forceps, with thread ligatures than with purification using the fingernail, because often the cut escapes further upward, because the foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer remains, and a second incision is necessary, causing more pain and danger. And with purification done by the shoemakers, which is digital, the incision of the male organ's extremity is not safe, because the blade easily enters the opening.
But in the operation with a fingernail, the blade easily slips and ruins your operation. And the foreskin of the child is naturally short, and many times it is born in such a way that it does not need purification, and I have seen that.
But the purification done with forceps and thread ligatures, its effectiveness, experience has shown me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, because the sharpness on top is as much as the sharpness on the bottom; and thus, when you press your hand, there are two equal sharpness, and it cuts according to a comparison in one moment; and the thread compression is done around the foreskin of the penis from every side, preventing any error.
And the method of the first operation is that you should keep the child still, especially if they are the ones that understand little, and that you tie the thread to the penis only, and that you leave it until the next day.
And then, make him/her happy in every way possible, so that he/she receives the appropriate understanding. And then, keep him/her still and prepared between your hands, and let him/her not be agitated; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them, nor any other instruments.
And then, place your hand on his/her penis and blow into the foreskin, and pull it back until the tip of the penis is exposed, and then clean it of any impurities that are on it.
The shape of the forceps for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt and the other should be sharp, so that the nail does not come out, and the length of both blades should be as long as two handles put together.
However, a mistake in the cleaning process is that you forcefully remove the entire or partial foreskin from the area around the incision.
Therefore, you must stretch that [part] of the foreskin with your finger before the incision of the area and cut it according to an even line.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with forceps and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and that which is inflamed under the penis remains after the abscess, then you leave it until the abscess subsides, and easily remove that [inflamed area], and cut it according to how you have prepared.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not be good for him.
And therefore, heal it with that which consolidates wounds from the powders that we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut from the testicles excessively, and the surrounding parts swell, that will not be good for him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by blockage from stones or congealed blood, or by pus or flesh, and similar to those things we have spoken of in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and the cause is very severe on the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction from him with an instrument called a syringe, which is of this form: It should be made of silver and be subtly conical, like a bird's quill, with a slender, long, reed-like tip about a palm and a half in length, with a thin tube on its head.
And the manner of drawing out the urine by this is that you take a doubled sheet of linen or cloth and tie it at its extremity; then insert the extremities of the linen into the part below the syringe, and cut off any superfluous part with scissors, but insert it forcefully into the tube.  Then you lubricate the syringe with oil and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and lubricate their bladder and penis with moist oils, and olive oil and water.
And then insert the syringe with ease until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe further into that; then push it further until it reaches the bladder, and that signals the patient's condition having reached the empty cause, and this is not done in this order, but rather where the urethra has a convoluted pathway.
And then pull the linen with the cloth little by little, for the urine will soak the cloth.
Then remove it and use the urine for treatment, and use the syringe, do not stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter .lix.
Of the quality of bladder flushing with a clamp and similar instruments suitable for this.
When a bladder ulcer or abscess occurs, or congealed blood is present, or the bladder opening is narrowed, and you want to introduce water and medicines there, then use an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form:
but rather, the tip of it is blunt, that is, closed. And in that (tip) there are three holes: two on one side, in pairs.
At the beginning is a concave space, in which that which is to be expelled is contained, and it should be according to the quantity that obstructs it, without addition, until when some cause is drawing out the humidities, it is drawn out, and when expelled, it is drawn out with it, and when it is expelled far, according to how the clamp functions which is used to place naphtha in naval battles.
Therefore, if you wish to introduce fluids into the bladder, insert the tip of the clamp into the fluid, and pull with it what is pushed towards the upper parts, for the fluid is drawn into the concavity of the clamp.
And then insert the tip of the clamp into the penis, as we have described in the treatise; and then push the fluid with what you are pushing, for that fluid reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient is cured from it.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is incised, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the head, the highest part, should resemble a small feather, and below it a canal within a ligament.
And then take the bladder, and place in it the fluid you want to incise in the bladder, and then tie that between two with a strong ligature with a double thread, and heat that fluid over the fire.
And then insert the end of the instrument into the penis.
And then press your hand on the bladder with the fluid, with a descending pressure, until the patient feels that the fluid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and pierce that throughout its entirety; and then insert strong thread into those holes, thus twisting it; and then assemble the circle as it is joined together, after which you place in it what you want of fluids, oils, and waters.
And then tie that to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed the stones in which manual operation, and incision, are used.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly that which is lodged within the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that bladder stones most commonly affect children; and among their symptoms is that the urine passed from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs their penis, and often strains, and the penis is drawn up; and with this, the anus is contracted in many of them.
And the cure is easier in children before they reach fourteen years; and the cure is difficult in the elderly. However, in young people it is more easily done because it's among them. (or "between those")
And in the case of a larger stone, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the opposite is true.
Therefore, in approaching the cure for this, it is necessary at the beginning to cleanse the patient with enemas, which extract all the waste from their bowels; because this waste sometimes obstructs the formation of the stone near the patient's kidneys.
And then the patient should be lifted by their feet and shaken and beaten gently underneath so that the stone descends to the bladder, or jumps from its position, sometimes.
And then place a heated compress between your hands, and place their hands beneath their thighs, so that the entire bladder is tilted downwards.
And then search for it and remove all of it from outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you immediately apply a cauterizing incision directly on it.
And if it doesn't completely fall downwards from your touch, then you should oil your left index finger (if the patient is a child) or middle finger (if the patient is a grown adult) and insert it into their anus. And push on the stone until it is beneath your finger. And move that little by little until it reaches the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and push it out through the openings around the area where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to, with their right hand, pull the genitals upwards, and with their other hand hold the ligament (or cord) below the genitals, near the incision site.
And then insert the instrument properly into the incision, which is the way to do it. And cut through the area between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be on that stone, and your finger be in the anus.  Make a transverse incision, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, according to the size of the stone that is there—as small as possible, not bigger; for if you press down on your finger in the anus too hard, the stone will be pushed out of the incision without difficulty.
And know that there is some stone at a particular angle and with hard edges, which makes its removal difficult.
And that one, resembling a nut (or testicle), is round, and is easily removed.
Therefore, if it is one with sharp angles and edges, it fits into the fissure (or crack).
And if it is not easily removed, then you must gently press upon it, or gently grasp it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and do not damage it; or introduce a slender, curved instrument beneath it.
But if you cannot move it, then enlarge the hole a little, and if you see blood flowing, stop it by pressing firmly with powdered vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then first push the hand towards the bladder opening, and then cut on it; and then push slightly further; and similarly do this if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to cut it with a large incision, for you risk one of two things to the patient: either death or a continuous flow of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer remedies to expel it until it is removed, or force a fracture of it with shears until you extract it in pieces.
Therefore, once you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and press firmly. And place over it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or in warmed oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may subside.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have loosened it, bathe the area with water and a bit of oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a hot, festering and corrosive abscess develops, and it resembles the condition where the blood is congealed in the bladder, preventing urination (and this is recognized by the blood present in the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will cause the bladder to decay and rot.
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and with whatever else is appropriate for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all the treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medications that are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, embedded there, and urination is also blocked, then treat it with what I have previously recommended, before resorting to surgery, for many times this treatment has been accused of leading to surgery; and I have tested this, and you should take a sharpened iron drill, of which this is the shape:
with a triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take flax, and bind the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing easily until the drill reaches that stone. And turn the drill with your hand on that small stone little by little, and you enlarge the hole until you make the other part penetrate; for the urine is immediately released.
And then press your hand on what is broken from the stone, on the outside of the penis, for it is cracked, and is forced out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for any reason which prevents it, then bind a flax below the stone, and another flax above the stone. And then cut onto the stone on that penis between the two bandages. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and cleanse the congealed blood, which has formed on the wound.
And a bandage of flax below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent its return to the bladder; the other bandage above is, however, necessary, because when the flax below is loosened and the stone is expelled, the calculus returns to its place and heals the wound.
And therefore, when you tie the flax above, it is necessary for you to lift the calculus upwards or to return it towards your intended goal, and thus heal the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if a stone appears in any of them, then its cure is difficult, and it is prohibited by many methods.
One of them is because the woman is very young/virginal.
And the second is that you do not find a woman well-informed who reveals herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or she is one of the married women.
The third is that you do not find a woman knowledgeable in this art, especially the manual operation.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on a stone in women is distant from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then it is necessary that you take a knowledgeable female physician, and few are found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skillful and subtle male doctor, or present a skilled matron knowledgeable in women's matters, or a woman who has advanced in this art.
Therefore, present her, and order her to do everything you command her, from the inquiry about the stone at the beginning; this is to see if the woman is a virgin, and then it is necessary that she place her finger in her anus and seek the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, grip it under her finger, and then command her to make an incision above it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the vagina of the patient and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and gently grasping it.
Therefore, if it is found, then it is necessary to gradually draw it from the opening of the bladder, towards the parts below, with gentle traction until you reach the root of the thigh.
And then, make an incision on the corresponding part of the vagina, towards the root of the thigh, wherever the stone is lodged, and hold the stone in that position, so that the patient's finger does not release the grasped stone.
And the incision should be small at first; then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then widen the incision according to the size needed to remove the stone.
And know that the types of stones are varied: for some are small and large, some rough and sharp, some long and round, and some with ridges.
Therefore, you know how many types there are, so that you can specify what you want.
And if you see blood flowing, apply crushed alum to the area and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your procedure until the stone is removed.
And ensure that you prepare the instruments needed for removing stones in men, so that you are assisted with your operation.
And if you see blood flowing, and know that the bleeding is coming from the incision, then apply powder to the area and compress it with bandages and strong constriction, and do not repeat this; leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient will die quickly. And then treat the wound.
So, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area has healed, then you return to your procedure until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of incision on a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white pouch, which is below the bone of the genitals containing the testicles, and is called a scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the proper pouch that nature has prepared in the area of the testicle, until there is a care that there is another testicle; and it is the bone of the genitals between the white scrotum which we have mentioned, and that is nothing but a hernia.
And the genesis of this hernia is due to weakness affecting the genitals, so that this matter is discharged into them, and sometimes it is caused by a blow to the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending toward citron or blood-red, or reddish, or is black, phlegmy, or watery and white, and that is what is most common.
And the signs by which one knows where this collection of water is are these: for if it is in the white scrotum that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, slightly elongated, thus like the shape of an egg, and the testicle appears, because the moisture surrounds it entirely.
And if the moisture is in the proper pouch, then the abscess is round with a part like a testicle and thus one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the groin of the genitals and the white scrotum, then it feels lower down.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the abscess with a thin probe, whose shape precedes it; and according to what comes out on the trace of the probe, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, it is necessary to order the patient to be bled, if that is possible, and to observe the patient's full body.
And then place him/her on their back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths underneath.
Then sit on the patient's left side, and tell the assistant to stand on the right side, holding a stick or rod at a point between the groin and the lower part of the belly.
And then, take a sharp knife and cut the groin area (or fleshy part of the groin) lengthwise, nearly to the pubic bone.
And the incision should be made evenly spaced from the line that divides the skin of the groin, until it reaches the white pubic bone.
And scrape that area, and observe, and be careful not to cut into it; and the scrape you make there, should be as suspended as possible with the finest and most delicate scrape, according to what you can achieve.
And then pierce the bladder full of water with a wide opening, and remove all the water.
And then separate the folds of the incision with forceps, and extend the bladder outwards; do not touch the groin area, and cut the bladder in a way that is possible for you. And cut it (the bladder) completely or in pieces, and especially the subtle layers, for if you do not carefully examine the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the egg (testicle) comes out of its sheath during your operation, then after completing the bladder incision, return it inside, and then close the two folds of the groin area with sutures, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you should tie off the vessels that support it, remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the water is collected in two separate areas, for example, know that there are two hernias; therefore, cut that area as you did in the other herniation; and if it appears to you that it is a single operation, then do so.
And then you clean the blood, and place wool soaked in oil or rosined oil into the incisions; and place another wool soaked in wine and oil outside of that, and spread that over the groin and the lower belly; and place over that doubled cloths and powders, and bind them together with a bandage of this form:
And then take two cloths, and fill them with dyed wool according to this pattern; and make the extremities, which are pressed by cotton or moist wool, and attach them with a binding to the underwear, and one extremity should go from the buttocks to the middle, and the second should go from the groin area to the thighs, and two extremities are placed on the thighs and two other extremities on the hips, and all the binding should be adjusted within the underwear.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with iron; and you should take a sharp knife cautery and use it to cut the skin of the groin area, and cauterize it as we have described until the white pouch containing the water is exposed, and then you should use a cautery in this form: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce that pouch, and cauterize it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then pull the pouch open with hooks, and scrape it with hooks, and scrape it with a heated thin cautery; and cut it as much as you can to remove everything; and be careful that the fire doesn't touch the egg-like thing [the underlying tissue].
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than an incision-based operation.
However, if you encounter a boil during the incision or cauterization, or bleeding, then you must treat whatever difficulty arises with a treatment appropriate to it, as has been described.
But if the patient is weak and cannot tolerate a second operation because of its severity, then perform the puncture as I have recommended; and this is when you are certain, based on what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is acute.
Then you must have the patient sit on some raised surface; carefully pierce the boil in the lowest part of it with a wide spatula, and make the puncture along the length of the body.
And keep the opening wide until all the water drains out.
Then place a cloth over the area, and bandage it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
However, if there is resistance to the draining of the water at that time, you pierce it: and this is done only because the white membrane at the opening of the wound resists and hinders the water's exit; then you must put in the wound a lancet or an instrument with which the water from dropsy is extracted, the form of which is previously described; or apply a small pressure on the wound.
And know that the water returns, and is collected again approximately six months or thereabouts; and when it collects, then it should be pierced according to the same method, so that the patient will survive his days.
Chapter 63.
Of the operation on a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the operation on this hernia there is a fear of death in the majority of cases; therefore, it is better to let it be and to try to save them another way.
And I am recalling the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the body's tissues where the humors are gathered, and this is caused by many things: either by acute, harsh excess humors, which are poured into the tissues, or by an impact.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the affected part of the body, and if no pain is found there, it is a serious abscess.
And a very serious abscess is a calcified one, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in the area.
And sometimes it is caused by the obstruction of the arteries, and by the inflammation of those, just as is perceived in its remembrance, or by the inflammation of veins.
However, that which is caused by the inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when you press on it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed from the area by any means despite pressing with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this type [of abscess] an incision should be made, and on the other tissues. You should cut through the sheath of the testicles, then spread the testicles apart, remove it [the affected tissue] from the white membrane, and free the supporting vessels, tie them, and cut through the supporting structure further than you free it from any part of the testicles.
Therefore, if the testicle is already attached to those tissues [with inflammation], then you must remove the testicle and cut it [the testicle].
And if there is adhesion to any part of the membrane, or between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion, which is behind [the testicle], then you must cut through everything there and remove the testicle as we have said.
So, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rubbed oil and wine; and subsequently treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of inguinal hernias.
The inguinal hernia is an abscess enclosed by a swelling similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the patient.
And in treating this illness, fear is important, due to what preceded it being remembered.
However, it is necessary to say the operation should be performed as soon as possible.
And I say that it is necessary to have the patient sit on a raised stool; then gently pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers, along with the instruments that are placed on the penis; and another assistant should do the same, and extend it with forceful stretching.
And then, with a sharp, broad scalpel, make a transverse incision along the side of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then, scrape away everything, in the same way as we described in the extraction of arrows from the temples.
And then, insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first of the points where you found the vein, and tie it again at the back of it. And then, cut those [vessels] in the middle, with a straight incision following the length of the body, and remove what is accumulated of the foul and corrupt humors.
And then, treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which pus is intended to be generated, so that the vessels which nourish one or the other [of the injured parts] may fall, for this is not harmful.
But if you find veins on all the [affected] vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be tied off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they are cauterized, or tied off, so that they are not useful.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a cut that extends onto the belly, from the sharp edges of the abdominal wall, so that the intestines from that rupture are [are then] next to some other intestines.
And this rupture is either from the abdominal wall or from a straining of it, and these two types occur due to many causes:  either impact, or a fall, or a loud noise, or a lifting of something heavy, or something similar.
And the sign of this, when it's due to straining of the abdominal wall, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and there is a swelling forming near the groin because the abdominal wall is pressing on the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a cut in the abdominal wall, is that initially it causes sudden violent pain; and there is a distinct swelling appearing below the skin close to the surface, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and the body [of the patient] is affected in areas outside of the abdominal wall.
And sometimes the intestine and tissue are expelled, and this is called a general intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is caused by gas, and sometimes a tear forms in the intestine, and it is trapped there, and this causes significant harm to the patient, and sometimes it produces severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the various forms of this illness with iron there is danger, so one should avoid its use in these cases.
And the method of operating on this is to instruct the patient to return the intestine with their hand to the inside of its cavity, if possible; and then carefully place it back on his/her abdomen, between your hands, and raise the patient's legs.
And then, carefully separate the spermatic cord, which is above the testicles, and cut the spermatic cord lengthwise; and then insert two hooks into the edges of the incision, as needed, to further open the incision.
And if, according to the amount that is possible for you, the testicle can be expelled from there.
And then, scrape away the tissues which are beneath the spermatic cord, until the hard white scrotum is exposed on each side.
Then, insert your finger into the area surrounding the testicle, in the white scrotum tissue, which lies beneath the spermatic cord, and detach any adhesions behind the testicle.
Then, hold the spermatic cord on the outside, and with this, pull the white scrotum up with your left hand, and lift the testicle up and away from the incision; and command the assistant to extend the testicle upward, while you dissolve the adhesions behind it with a suitable solution.
And with your fingers, check that there is no intestinal cause wrapped within the hard white scrotum. But if you find any such cause, then you push it back into the abdomen below.
Then cut into the area below the spermatic cord, so that blood and pus flow as we have described in the preceding text.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the bandage we described (and sometimes the scrotum is cauterized, which we mentioned in relation to the incision of the area to prevent blood flow, as this often happens), and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the wound is slow to heal, then hot water should be applied, and held over it until it falls off, as we have said.
Then treat the wound with other wound treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of the windy hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that has been benefited by burning it with iron.
And the first (doctors) said that it is done like we have described in the hernia with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision with ease, then dry the middle area around the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And treat the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that is done in the ankles.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the ankles, as we have said, and you should elevate the area.
And do not leave any cause of intestines in the groin; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is adjusted in the groin until the intestine descends into the groin; and this happens due to the extension of the groin, which is in the ankles, as we have said, which causes the groin to be stretched, and subsequently softened, and the area becomes suppurated and elevated.
And the cure for it is with cautery, as is preceded by the narration of it.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron following this method:  and it is that the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the suppurating swelling with cauterization by incision to a width according to the quantity of three days.
And then, pull the white groin area, which is under the hip, until it is exposed.
And then take the reed and place it on the prominent area of the groin, and press it against the belly button.
And then stitch the two prominent areas on the extremity of the groin's reed, and join one of them to the other with the suture.
And then remove the extremity of the reed, and do not sever the groin completely, nor extend the testicles, nor any other such thing, as I have shown you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for sores, and as you would cut away the pus, cleanse it and restore the sore until it is healed; for the groin is contracted, and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is more conducive to health.
Chapter 68.
Of the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Often the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened in this way, because the flesh around it is softened, and care is taken of it.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is engaged in its treatment to have the patient lie according to his side, and gently spread all the softened swelling over the natural swelling; and then to draw together the two edges with sutures.
And if you wish, stitch the excess of the softened swelling at the beginning with three or four stitches, and with firm sutures.
And then, cut between the sutures; and then treat it by treating the other sores until it is healed and the pus comes out.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our law, is forbidden, but because of the reasons given to me, I am obliged to mention it in this book; and it is not necessary to remember it except in two ways.  One is so that when a physician is questioned about it, he will know how to treat whatever happens to him; and the other is that we often have need of castrating other animals for our benefit, just as we do with oxen, goats, pigs, and animals of similar kind.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by slitting and cutting.
But in the method of castration by crushing, the way to operate is to immerse the animal in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are broken and no longer appear beneath the touch.
But in castration performed by slitting and cutting, you must hold the animal and press the scrotum with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut into each testicle with a cut until both testicles are removed.
And then cut those further, once you've skinned each one. And do not leave any cause on those of the scrotum, but only the thin scrotum that is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better, which is done by attrition, because strong attrition leaves no cause in the testicles for the animal to desire mating.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when there appears in the scrotum area, in the space between the testicles, a figure resembling a woman's vulva, with hair in it.
And sometimes urine flows from the area between the testicles.
But in women, there is one type:  the woman's vulva on her pubic region is like two testicles of a man somewhat diminished at the outer edge, similar to the foreskin of a man, and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: for two of the men's types and one type of the women's. And it is necessary that you cut those adhering flesh until the swelling subsides, and then treat them with the treatment for other sores.
And in the second type for men, where urine is in the groin area around the testicles, there is no treatment or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of tumors and prominent flesh due to women's causes.
A mild tumor, adhering to natural causes, until it is squeezed and made smooth, is observed; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to the point of spreading just like in men and preventing intercourse.
Then you should hold the excess tumor with your hand or forceps and cut it.
And do not overdo the cutting, especially at the root of the tumor, so that you do not cause a flood of blood.
And then treat it with the treatment for sores until it is healed.
But a fleshy growth is a flesh that grows within the womb of the mother until it fills it, and easily extends to the outside parts like a tail (and thus some earlier ones called this 'tail disease'); therefore, we must cut it as we cut a tumor, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of elephantiasis.
Elephantiasis is when the vaginal opening of a woman is not perforated, or is very small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that has preceded it, and that illness is caused either by poorly fitting flesh, or by a subtle or thick cicatrix.
And it is formed either on the mother's womb, or on her ribs, or on the highest part of her body, or the lowest, and you prohibit coitus, pregnancy, and childbirth, and strongly prohibit menstruation.
And the knowledge of this is obtained by observing the woman; if the obstruction is evident, treat it promptly. But if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your probing or with a ray (likely a medical instrument).
But if the obstruction is due to a thin cicatrix, and is close to the two lips, then you should cut and break it open.
And you should place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers of both hands upon them.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then forcefully extend the two lips until that thin cicatrix is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it over the area, and let the patient lie down with a man for the day, so that the incised area does not heal.
But if the cicatrix is thick and large, then it is necessary that you cut it with a sharp knife or a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to flesh, then suspend it with forceps, and cut it.
And have with you medicines that stop blood flow without causing a bite, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and alum, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep that in place for several days and apply poultices of dried herbs.
And then treat it with other healing methods of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes it extends to the surrounding flesh, and then it is necessary to cut it according to this method. But if it is due to a brain abscess, a brain abscess which is in the head should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of the tail and red swelling that occurs in the vagina of women.
Hemorrhoids are understood as the openings of many veins through which a lot of blood continuously flows; and when these hemorrhoids are longstanding and inflamed.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these [hemorrhoids] and their symptoms, and I will now explain which ones receive treatment and which ones do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and inflammations, when they are deep within the anus and do not appear outwardly, then treatment with iron should not be attempted for them.
But those which are at the opening of the anus, where you can feel them, are those which can be treated.
And you should place the woman in a cool place and then carefully cut the inflammation with shears, or with a rough cloth, and cut those inflamed areas at their roots.
And then sprinkle over those areas the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without a mordant, such as acacia and similar ones.
And then soak their feet for an hour, and then place them in cool water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then place it in a decoction of pomegranate seeds and bark, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a poultice with this and place it on their back.
And if the blood is separated, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without making incisions.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or arnica juice, or agrimony juice with diluted wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Concerning the accidental piercing of the breast.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the breast, such as cancer, stony abscesses, ulcers, inflamed swellings, eruptions, fistulas, hemorrhoids, sores, and other abscesses. And I have already described these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division.
And it is necessary that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess which comes in the breast when it is of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you wish to know in what way the operation of it is done with iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with throbbing, phlegm, and fever, and if there is redness and if you feel the pus, then do not hurry with piercing it, and treat it with what aids in maturation until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you must have the woman lie down on a bed with two mattresses; and lean her on her two sides and draw her feet towards the lower part of her belly, and spread her thighs, and place her arms under her temples, and bind each one with a bandage suitable for it.
And then the midwife, standing on the right side, administers the instrument with which the opening in the breast is made, the shape of which will be apparent in those things that will be done next.
And when you want to administer this instrument, you must insert its tip into the nipple of the woman's breast, and what enters the breast with the instrument should be no more than the nipple, and comfort the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the nipple, then you must place powders on the nipple's surface to prevent any instrument from entering the nipple.
And you should place the lubricant that is on the instrument on the upper side, and the attendant should hold the instrument and rotate the lubricant until the opening of the breast is opened.
And when the discharge appears, and it is touched with the hand and is yellowish and moist, then you must dry that area around his head with a linen cloth.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then you should place a piece of cloth soaked in rubbed oil or green oil (in which there is some astringent substance) on the affected area, and place the compress on the nipple's region.
And place over the breast, and on the surrounding area, a clean wool cloth soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And it should be treated for approximately two days with the ointment that is appropriate for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the breast and the affected area are washed in a way that is cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long-stemmed iris has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the affected area is deep within the breast, then you should be prohibited from treating it with iron, having treated it with what we have mentioned in the section.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living infants when their bodies are not formed naturally.
It is necessary for the midwife to know, at the beginning, the natural form of childbirth through its signs.  When you see the woman straining downwards, and she desires to breathe air, and is relieved by what is upon her in childbirth, and hastens the delivery of the infant, then know that this birth is according to the natural form. The delivery of the infant is upon its head, and the afterbirth with it, either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, the woman's abdomen should be compressed so that the infant descends easily. For when it descends upon its head, it leaves the afterbirth, which is cleansed of those superfluities with good cleaning.
But that which is different from this birth is unnatural and undesirable, for when the infant emerges feet first and its body comes out before its head and feet, or one hand, or one foot, or its head, or its hand or belly, and the head is turned to its neck forcefully and resembles other undesirable shapes.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what ingenuity is in them so that it is signified by this and be stated about it.
When the birth is accomplished upon its head through natural progression, and this is difficult for the woman and her powers are weakened, then have the women hold the child, and evaporate the child's heat with collected fenugreek and moist oils.
And now the midwife should gently insert her fingers into the small space or cleft and with that detach the afterbirth, or cut it with her fingernail until she removes the moisture within it. And press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be treated with poultices of plantain and fenugreek with cumin.
And now command him, now the one applying the poultice, to be firm and make the woman sneeze with force; and hold her mouth and nostrils for one hour, for the fetus will be expelled soon.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must gently return them little by little. But if you do not succeed in the procedure, then place the woman on a table and lift her feet up, and then lower the table onto the ground; and the woman should be held so she does not fall during the action.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then cut them and remove the remaining part of the fetus or tie the body to the woman's hand with a cloth and remove it evenly, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must push them upwards, and then turn the fetus gently, and then cradle it, and then take one of its feet and extend it gently.
But when it has emerged between the thighs, then you instruct it to strain, and make it cough with force, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled with what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with an easy delivery.
And if it is not expelled with all that we have recounted, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, and pound it well in a mortar, and then apply it to the vagina of the woman, to the lower part of her abdomen. And then apply a poultice in lukewarm water, until the hypochondria (the lower ribs and sides of the abdomen) are eased.
And when the lower parts of the body are soothed, then apply a fumigation of myrtle and place it over the patient. And when the fumigation has been applied for an hour, then you place it on a linen cloth, and then make the person sneeze and press their mouth shut, and remove the cloth and apply gentle pressure to the lower abdomen, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
Expulsion of the fetus lengthwise while one of her hands is used. Be resourceful in reducing the [fetus's] hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if walking is not possible, then have her lie down on the bed, and forcefully squeeze her thighs, and then administer medicines that I have recommended, made from mucilages.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, and then consider the reduction of the hand, and gently guide the fetus into its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to push until it is expelled.
The fetus is on the mother's pelvis, its hands and face are turned towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the fetus's hand and gently, little by little, turn it, and remove it with ease.
And when it is positioned correctly, then apply to its navel what we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then command her to gently cough, and when you have done this, have her sit on a stool and command her to lean to her right side, and then command her to push; and make her sneeze with condiments. The prepared fetus is delivered on its side.
When the mother is delivered of the horrific thing (likely referring to the afterbirth) in this manner, consider it, and then you cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended by the face and neck, then you cut the umbilical cord so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus towards the parts inside until you have positioned it correctly, and instruct the woman to push a few times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but this is unusual and rarely happens; but these are things outside the natural order, and not living.  (This last part is a bit ambiguous and potentially referring to deformed or non-viable infants)
And count those, whether they are multiple, as a single set, and separate them by their umbilical cords.  And sometimes they are expelled as easily as one fetus through natural means, and sometimes through unnatural means, as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver and fall into what we have described as unnatural occurrences, then treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is ingenious according to every figure, according to what is prepared for her by the skillful attendant to bring about health.
A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb, and it has already been verified by me that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all formed.  The cause of this was determined by the learned wise.
And all this should be within the midwife's knowledge, for it is easily perceived by someone similar to her, and therefore she should apply herself to it accordingly.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of the treatment, and it has not come out, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you must consider whether the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted by any of the conditions that cause concern for her loss.
Then the woman should be positioned on the bed on her back, with her head tilted downwards and her thighs elevated.
And the attendant should hold either both sides or bind her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then seek with her hand the place where she can hook her fingernails into the fetus.
And suitable places for this: then consider if the fetus is ready to descend onto its head, and then you should hook your fingernails into its neck, or into its jaw, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its chin, or into its armpits, or into the appropriate places on the sides, or under the ribs.
But if the descent is on its feet, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the fingernail with the right hand, and to place its curve in that place which is between the fingers of the left hand, and to gently insert the hand and hook the fingernail into any of those places we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
And then place another fingernail, or a third if necessary, in its vicinity, so that there is a pulling, not a stretching according to its natural state alone.
And it should be moved in all directions, so that its removal is eased just as is done in a tooth removal.
And it is necessary in that which is between them that the stretching be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary for the midwife to anoint some of her fingers with oil, and insert those fingers and twist with them that which is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fet is expelled, then the fingernails should be moved to a higher location; and do this until all of the fet is expelled.
But if the hand is pulled out ahead of the other, and it is not possible to return it by constricting it, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is completely expelled, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus it is necessary that you do the same for the other hand and the two feet.
But if the head of the fet is large, or constriction happens during its expulsion, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the ribs and split the head and remove the water, or to cut it with an instrument called "alundat," the shape of which will be shown with the other instruments in the chapter following this one.
And similarly, do this if the fet is naturally large-headed: and then it is necessary to cut it with *algematu* (or something else), or to grasp it with *alunda* as we have said; and then remove the bones with forceps.
And if the head is expelled and is constricted towards the fork (furcula), then it should be split until the moisture which is in its feet is discharged.
But if it is not complicated, nor obstructing the expulsion, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscess-ridden or dropsical, then you must pierce it until the moisture within it runs out.
But if the fet is on its feet, then the traction on it is gentle and the direction of it towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is constricted towards the belly and the feet, then you must extract it with a cloth that you will have wrapped around your hand, and split the belly and feet until what is within them runs out.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she inserts her hand into the air space, and searches for the head with it, and pulls it with her fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then inserts a finger, or two fingers, and pulls it with them.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by a hot abscess that has befallen it, then it should not be disturbed. Instead, a discharge of fatty, moist substances should be administered beforehand. And administer plasters; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, let it be turned; and what we have said about a living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave any cause within the afterbirth.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of boils which occur in the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then put them in astringent waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb a stillbirth had occurred, and shortly thereafter pregnant again, and shortly after that, another stillbirth occurred. A long time ago, a boil occurred near his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and medicated him for a long time, and the wound was not healed.
Then I applied some strongly adhesive plaster to him, and a bone came out of him, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was greatly amazed, as there are no bones inside the belly.
And then I thought they were bones from the stillborn child.
Then I continued treating the wound, and extracted many bones from him. The woman, being in her right state of health, and having lived in this condition for a long time, recovered a little from the illness.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but rather that this is knowledge and assistance to what the skilled physician provides with his hands in administering treatment.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for extracting the fetus.
A method of turning with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a clamp in which the books are clasped, with two turns at the two ends of two rods. However, this turning needs to be more subtle than a clamp, and should be made either of ivory or of a piece of wood.
And the width of each rod should be two fingers, and the margin of each two fingers, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two rods there are two attachments of the same rod, which are already fixed, whose length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two attachments are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it is opened by them when you turn the two prescribed turns.
Another similar form, even more subtle and lighter:
It should be made of ivory or wood, resembling forceps. However, at its extremity there are two attachments like those previously described, and the length of those attachments is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with them, then you have the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging down, her legs spread apart. And then open your hand with the instrument, as if using scissors, to the extent desired, according to the opening of the mother's mouth, until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo, which the ancients described:
A form of pushing with which the fetus is pushed:
A form of bonding/connection with which the large head is contained.
And it resembles forceps, having teeth at the end, as is often the case.  Sometimes it is made long like forceps, in this form, as often happens.  It has teeth like saw teeth, with which it is incised and contained. A form of slight connection/bonding.
A form of a hook having a spine/point.
A form of a hook having two spines/points.
A form of spatula with two ends, with which the head is severed.
A form of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments are used, and the more the species of them are multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the lighter their operation is and the more beneficial to men for their quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, wherever they may be needed by you, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the second tooth.
When the second tooth is retained during childbirth, then you should command the patient to hold their breath, and then make them sneeze with a stimulus, and press your hand on their mouth and nose. If by this the tooth is extracted, good.
And if not, then you take a bowl, pierce a hole in its cover, and place inside it herbs – chamomile, rue, anise, camomile, and Arabic cicada, cassia wood, and St. John's wort – opening the mother's mouth, as is appropriate. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the bowl, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
And then make her sneeze as we said, and the second tooth will be forcefully expelled.
However, if this treatment remains ineffective and the tooth is not removed, then instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow extract, and then insert it into the socket and gently search for the tooth with it.  Once located, carefully pull it out gradually.  If the tooth is lodged deep within the gum, then insert her hand as previously described, and when the tooth is found, extract it slowly and gently to avoid causing excessive pain to the mother. Beforehand, it is necessary for the tooth to be moved from side to side with ease.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and herbal poultices.
However, if it has not been expelled by all the methods we have described, be careful not to further irritate it by repeated attempts to remove it.  Instead, whatever is lodged in the mother's mouth should be placed on the woman's thigh, and then treat it with unguent and tetrapharmacon; this will cause it to decompose over a few days, eventually dissolving and being expelled.
But when it decomposes, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, distressing the patient; and then fumigations and appropriate remedies must be administered.
However, some of the ancients had already tested fumigations using dried nard and figs.
Method of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for retention of menstrual blood and the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And the narrow end should be placed in the cone, and the wider end above the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her maintain it until the fumigation is consumed and then make another.
Treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born with unperforated anuses, which are very narrow and obstructed. Therefore, the midwife should perforate that narrowing with her finger; and if not, then perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the sphincter.
And then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it is obstructed, then place a tube into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child is ready to swallow.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a plague or an abscess; then that consolidation must be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the cure and the use of lead.
Of the treatment of the fistulas that subsequently appear.
The fistulas that develop in the lower area, swollen and thickened, which appear near the anus externally or in the area of one side.
And it is a fistula or abscesses.
And when that swelling is longstanding and is caused by watery white moisture or subtle putrefaction, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known for what comes out of them through discharge and by the windiness; and sometimes the patient uses discharge, and often worms come out from them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some of those penetrating ones go into the joint of the thigh and into the bone marrow of the thigh.
And the way a penetrating fistula is recognized, compared to a non-penetrating one in the anus, is that you insert your index finger into the anus, and carefully insert a small probe of ram's horn or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
But if there is a twisting in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair against your finger.
And if you don't feel any of that at all, and no discharge, worms, or gas comes from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating, and then your efforts should turn to treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates the bladder or the urethra, the sign of it is urination from that area and the prohibition of it until the place is healed with medicine.
But if it is penetrating into the joint or bone, causing pain in the surrounding area, then the sign of it is that the probe passes into it if there is no twisting into the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that there is often a prolonged illness; and that treatment there is not effective, nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the cure of those is the hard work and vanity of learned physicians upon which you must rely.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, as I tell you, and this I have already tested.
And it is necessary that the patient lie between your hands on their back, and raise their legs upwards, with the thighs bent towards their stomach, and then carefully insert a lead probe, or an iron one if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know the spot where the probe penetrates.
And if the pain is around the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your finger into the anus.
And if, when inserting your finger, you feel the probe already penetrating itself, or if you feel something between your finger and that tissue or flesh, then be certain that it is penetrating; and so do not work on that, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
But however, some might say that it is cured in some men slowly.
And the treatment by which recovery is expected in this case is that you apply a thin heated cautery, according to the width of the fistula, as previously described, and introduce it into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times, until you know that all the flesh around the fistulous opening, which resembles the hollow of a bird's feather, has been cauterized.
And then treat it with some bandages until all the cauterized flesh has healed, and then treat it with healing and strengthening medicines; and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it will not be healed in any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate inside your finger that is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula is on the surface of the anus, then cut the anus at the beginning of the fistula, and cut with the probe; and let it be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the tip of the probe reaches, and through the probe it is released and removed.
And then cleanse those fistulous tissues, which are gathered like a bird's feather quill, so that no cause remains.
However, if blood flows between you and your procedure when you cauterize that flesh, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire has two good effects: it burns the cauterized tissues, and it stops the blood flow and removes the moisture.
And then treat it with bandages or a linen compress until the area heals, and then treat the wound with ointments that strengthen and heal the flesh.
And these medicines, which have astringent and drying properties; when it is restored, it is already healed and you do not fear a recurrence.
However, if the fistula extends to the anus and is far from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And therefore, if you feel resistance, and between you and it there is a membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation there, but rather, it should be treated with hope and trust.
This condition can be treated in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach its cavity, so that you can introduce remedies and achieve a cure; and do not cut too deeply, lest you injure the surrounding tissues, and thus cause harm to the patient unintentionally; and then treat it with what we have said, for it will be easily healed; or else, remove the membrane and cleanse the pus, cutting it back toward the anus as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp tip, and then remove the fistula tissues that are within the incision, after which you can use a scab to help the healing; and then strive to restore the entire wound with cuts, and if the opening above is not healed and the fistula remains open in the anal area, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is treated in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is located in the folds of the anus near the body's surface, and at the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a sharp tip, which is similar to a needle, prepared in this manner:
and insert it into that, wrapped in five or so threads; and then insert the threaded probe into the fistula until it reaches the cavity.
However, if it is penetrating near the edge of the anus, then you remove the thread from that opening as if you were inserting your finger into the anus; and you pull out the thread's end and join the two ends together, tightening each one.  Leave it like this for a day or two, and when you cut the thread into the flesh, firmly grasp it until the tissues between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
But if the fistula's opening is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever manner you are prepared, but not too deeply in the region, for you must not cut into the tendons; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the probe used to open the fistula: one curved end is very sharp, and the other part is blunt, so you don't cut what's unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids come in two ways, for either they are like lumps within the anus, as if made of knots, or they are like bunches of grapes. And they are small or large, and the blood flows from them constantly, and they are single or multiple, and they are outside the anus, and at the extremities of it.
However, those outside the anus are according to the periods of less moisture, from which yellow water or a little blood with a continuous flow comes, and it is according to the colour of the flow.
And the treatment of those inside the anus is that you should tell the patient to sit down and press until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you hold and lift them with tweezers or your fingernails, and then cut them away from their roots.
But if the tweezers are not holding them due to their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth, or cotton, or wool strips, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them, and sprinkle some hot powders over their incisions, so that they will be like cauterization; or cauterize them, according to what is preceded in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with another treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not yield to evacuation, then prick the patient with a cautery in which there is a small bite, and wash it with whatever is inside the anus, so that it yields to evacuation easily when the patient is squeezed.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or tweezers, and cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And for those you have cut, you should apply stitches to them in this manner: take a thread wrapped around, insert it into a needle, then pull the hemorrhoids apart, and pierce it with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap both ends of the thread in the portion below the needle, and do it latitudinally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong bandage, then tie the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them unsewn, so that the excess blood will flow from it.
And then place a cloth soaked in heated oil or ointment on the anus; place it over the area and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls out; and when it has fallen out, treat them with ointments or other remedies until healed.
And when they are old and no longer respond to that treatment, then you must scrape them with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist and the crust of pus on top, which prevents healing, is removed; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed and are raw; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that alamermar, this is the key, and it is nothing but a red spot, like a small nailhead, according to the colour of the body, and it is found throughout the body, especially in the parts below the feet and in the joints, and it is indicative of that disease's affliction.
Then it is necessary to cut out that which is around the spot, using shears or forceps, and to remove it from its root; and then treat that area.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round elevation on the surface of the body, and it often appears on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to scrape or cut it, or to squeeze it with a file or a needle until it breaks. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But a pimple is a small, festered or fistulous, large elevation on the surface of the body, often found on the groin.  When the cold touches it, it feels like an ant bite, and it forms around the body.
And the treatment is to take a hollow tube made from a hawk's or vulture's feather, strong, and place it over the pimple until the tube encircles the pimple's edges.  Then, twist your hand with the tube until you cut through what is within the pimple's circle, and place it on the flesh around it, eradicating the pimple from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron, following this method:
The part above the tube should be slender, closed (that is, not pierced), wrapped so that the grip on it is firm and its rotation smooth.
And if you want to cauterize the pimple, do so as previously described in the section on cauterizing ulcers in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the forms of instruments used for providing care.
Sometimes care is provided with instruments of silver, or bronze, or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes it is done with small or large instruments, depending on those being treated, for that which is used to treat small children should be small, and those for the treatment of sore or painful buttocks should be small.
The form of large and small care/treatment.
The head of the cannula above it, to which the bag is attached, should be wide in this manner; and it should be distinguished where the bag is attached, just as before.
And the lower end of it, which is inserted into the anus, should be completely closed (that is, not open) very thin, and narrow; and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger one.
And the bag, in which the bladder medicines are placed, be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its bottom should be one palm wide.
And it should be pierced with many holes, as it is revolved; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of a finger.
And then introduce into those holes strong, thick, crude bile, which should be of ten or thereabouts; and attach the bag to that.  And when the bag is placed in its place, tighten the top of the instrument tightly between two separating ones, with firm constriction.  Then seal each hole with that [instrument].  However, the way of sealing with that is to fill the bag with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
And now the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs, and place a cloth beneath them, on which are blankets or a sheet; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; and then insert it into the anus with ease, and then the attendant should take the bag and squeeze it with two hands and fingers forcefully until everything in the instrument is evacuated into the bowels; and then remove the instrument, and the patient should lower their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine causes it to come out, hold it as long as possible; and if they sleep with it all night, it is better for healing.
But if you cauterize for ailments of loose bowels and evacuation of it, then you repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then the cautery should be very fine and slender, like those used to cauterize children.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of plagues what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of them with hands and with medicines according to the progression.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diverse depending on how they are caused and according to the place where the plague occurs.
And the causes for which plagues are often caused are thus: throwing of stones, or cutting with a sword or knife, or hitting with a spear, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar to those of many causes.
But the plagues that are in the places of the body are like a plague that falls on the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar, and it has only broken the skin and is a large wound, and you fear the onset of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should quickly bleed from the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw from him the blood according to his strength, if no other cause prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be on the opposite side of the affected part; and guard the patient from repletion and from strong foods and drinks.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then lessen the patient's intake of food and do not allow him near meat or wine.
And if a hot abscess occurs on the wound, apply a cloth steeped in warmed oil, or in wine in which a styptic has been soaked, to the wound.
But if a hot abscess is certain, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and if the air hasn't changed that powder which I shall tell you about shortly.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or from a cut or similar injury, and its edges are not brought together by sutures, then bring those together with sutures, as I will explain concerning their suture.
However, if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is no retention but a small suspension, then cut that, and then cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh there, instead of codena, and command the patient to eat foods rich in fat: heads of various animals, and other similar parts, until it is complete.
And if you find putrefaction in the flesh and it does not adhere to the bone, then you cut away all the putrid material and throw it away, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flow may result, and it is not severed by medicines, then you investigate the artery, and if you find it not severed, then you sever it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you that what we have said does not work, then you cauterize until the blood flow is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore, you can sprinkle this powder over them, for it will consolidate them before the air changes them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt resin; let all be finely ground and sifted, and then fill the wound with it, and bind it firmly until it adheres well to it and is coagulated by the blood.
And then you bandage it with dressings and leave it, and do not remove them until it is healed, for the medicine will not be effective until it is completely healed.
And sometimes this works alone, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood readily available.
And you perform this same operation on large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it, and they are tightly bound, and for fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is summertime, then this powder application is not appropriate, but rather treat them with what we have previously described, or apply digestive ointments, or a powder made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until it forms a paste; and then treat them with the other method until they are healed.
But if, by chance, the wound is accompanied by a fractured bone, and it is small, then you extract it with a gentle action.
And I will describe the treatment for head fractures in what follows.
Of wounds of the neck.
However, if the wound happens on the neck, there is no difference in treatment, and it is treated similarly to a simple wound of the head.
However, if the neck wound involves an incised nerve or artery, if it's a nerve,  it shouldn't be treated with anything that causes strong astringency, like zinc or verdigris (which is vitriol) and similar things, because they harm the nerves and resist healing. And do not apply anything excessively cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the limbs.
And if it is treated with mild remedies, such as washing the wound with fresh water, sometimes infused in oil (whether it has been processed or not), and applying poultices when washing it with fresh water, and other similar medicinal stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or stitch the edges together, and then treat it with powders until it heals.
But if the wound is deep or extends to the lowermost part of the tissue, then pierce it in the deepest place.
But if an artery is already cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then either tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or the entire spine have been cut and the neck veins are saved, then you should stitch the edges of the spinal column together along the spine and do not touch it; initially straighten it and return it to its natural position, then tightly secure it with proper bandages, and leave it for some days.  Then treat it with ointments that are styptic and supportive until it is healed.
But if the wound has already reached the bone, treat it. Then, if there are bone fragments in it, remove all you can; and what you cannot remove, leave it until the wound can fester and separate, and the discharge is lessened.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle the powder recommended to you over it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what is mentioned in its corresponding chapter.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife, and you see how deep it is, then consider if the wound is becoming more inflamed when the patient weakens; if so, understand that the wound is fatal.
And if it is not deep, and the wound is recent, with its own blood, then in the first hour you put powder on it, and do not press it so that the blood is not trapped deep inside and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but put an attractive ointment there, and remove it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available to you, then place old lint over the wound opening to absorb any moisture; and have the patient sleep on the wound to allow any accumulated matter to drain out.
However, if three days or more have passed since the wound, and the patient shows no spasms, tremors, or heart distress, or other bad conditions, then understand that the wound is healing; and then treat it with poultices and other appropriate remedies until healed.
But if the healing of the wound is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then understand that a fistula has already formed; treat it then according to its specific treatment method.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or sword, and is superficial on the foot or back, then treat it with stitches if it's large, or with powder if it's small.
But if the injury has already penetrated the bone, and some pieces of bone have been severed, then you should clean the wound and attempt to remove those pieces if they are loose. But if they are not loose, then leave them until the wound can heal, as removing them will cause pain.
And for other wounds affecting other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as what we have already described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment affecting the abdomen is either severe, mild, or moderate.
And a small rupture is difficult to repair in another way, and the reduction of them is even more difficult if the intestines are not returned to their place promptly, for if it opens and becomes swollen, the insertion of it is made difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is moderate, for in that case the reduction of the intestines is not difficult, as it is in the two aforementioned types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two of these sutures are common to those used for other wounds on the body.
And two other sutures, though similar to those used on other wounds, are nonetheless more specific to abdominal sutures.
And I will explain each to you with exposition and declaration.
So I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestines has protruded through it, and it is difficult to return it, this can happen in one of two ways: either due to the small size of the rupture, as we have said, or when the intestines have become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And so when this is the case, you should warm the area by soaking a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone, or in water with stinging nettles, cyperus, and spikenard, and apply this to the intestine until the inflammation subsides.
And sometimes, using water with astringents is better than plain water for resolving the inflammation.
And when you see the inflammation subsiding, then moisten the intestine with water in which mullein and mallows have been boiled, for this will ease his internal suffering with little effort.
But if the internal suffering is relieved by this treatment, then gently dissect the rupture a little with an instrument used for hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better, when it's appropriate and doesn't involve cutting, and there is no need to dry it out or cause weakness.
Of the instrument, describe its shape:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the end is thin, but not as thin as a spatula; rather, it is a little blunt.
And therefore, if the wound is aggravated and the intestine is outside, then its reduction should be according to its natural shape, in its proper place, if possible, because that is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise the head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then always keep your attention and consideration focused on this, so that the part where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in both large and smaller wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant hold the rupture entirely with their hand and close the edges together, and then determine the cause of any further sutures needed.
And this is the common method of suturing: take a needle, or needles according to the size of the wound; then place the tip of the needle at the edge of the rupture on the ring finger, and thread the needle through, or otherwise you do not place the thread in the two ends of the opening, with the two ends of the thread underneath the opening to bring them together; and you have now joined the two ends of the opening and the two ends of the thread, making four stitches.
Then tie with double thread around the needle, and sometimes from two sides together, and then close the two edges and the wound with a proper closure; and then leave the thickness of a finger and insert another needle there, and then tie it with thread in the same way as the first needle; and do not stop doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And the needles should be of medium thickness, neither too fine nor too thick; for fine needles easily pierce the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to thread, and therefore they should be of medium thickness.
And the needle should not be placed too close to the two ends of the opening, so that the flesh is not pierced easily and the wound opens up before its healing.
And the sutures should not be prolonged, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not bother the patient during their sleep; and place spread powders on the suture from all sides, holding the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know the wound is already healed.
And this method of suturing with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient for their closure.
However, the second suture is a standard one: and it is that you close the four edges, of the opening, and the two edges of the cut, all at once, with a needle of a fidelity, size, and fineness suitable for the task.
And then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same place you started, so that the thread retracts from the most superior part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth stitch, as when cloths are joined.
And place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men (or, and this suture is known by men).
And with this suture, I closed the wound that had befallen a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was more than a palm in length, and the intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle part and the rupture was in the middle of the limb; and then I rejoined that part after the intestines had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated within fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him, and he is healed; and after this, he lived for many years, and he is recovered in his condition.
And other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and by a miracle, it was, for I did not cure him with ointments, for it was in a place where no ointment or medicine was to be found, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and continuously washed it with honey water until he was healed.
But I will tell you two kinds of sutures, proper according to the account of Paraula.
And it is that you begin with a suture of the cord, and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so, as the needle penetrates the cord and in that same laceration, following its straight and length along the whole body, and leave the end of the thread where you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate from the inside to the outside at the other end of the slit.
And when you have made that penetrate, then you make it penetrate again into that same slit of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this loop, and make the needle penetrate the other end of the wound from the inside to the outside.
And make that penetration with the penetration that you make the thread enter the wound at the end of the wound, which is on the part towards him until all that penetrates.
And then begin on this same side and stitch that with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the cord which it penetrated, and then return that into that cord and stitch the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the wound; and remove that from the cord that is on the side of him.
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time until you sew all of that which is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suturing is that you sew with the suturing of hides, with which you sew the hides, so that you sew the thread once from the side of the end of the cord, and that you leave that again until you have completed it.
But the second species of suture, which is also called Gaulish, and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you stitch it in a similar manner to how some medical practitioners stitch it, in such a way that they join each part to its corresponding part to him according to nature; and they apply the end of one to him and the end of the wound to the other end of him, and this is done according to what I have recounted to you.
You must place the needle into the end of the wound close to the outside part, and have it penetrate to the inside part of that same place, and leave both ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and have it penetrate from outside to inside at both ends of the thread.
And then turn each of those, and have each one penetrate from the inside part to the outside part at the two ends of the wound, other than those on the opposite side.
And this manner of suturing is better than the common, superficial suturing, and it is the suturing of which the previous recollection has spoken.
This is the Gaulish method/teaching.
And perhaps some would say, the suturing of the belly is rectified with two needles, meaning that you insert a thread into each of them, and begin with the insertion of a needle from your side, and have it penetrate to the other side according to the suturing of those who know how to stitch the skin evenly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle part of the belly, then its suturing is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is a judgment of the other plagues.
Which means that when you catch the plague in its early stages, before the air alters it, and you return the intestine to its place and stitch it up and prepare it properly, then you apply the flesh-forming powder to it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply some of the ointments that you have present until they form a hard scab and the threads are consolidated and looked after; and then treat it like the treatment of other plagues until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines present, then apply it as soon as it begins to cast off pus, old matter, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need any other medicine in many cases when the plague is simple.
However, if you fear the plague might spread to major limbs, then you should immerse lion's wool in high-quality olive oil, or in clarified oil, and place it around the areas between the armpits and under the armpits.
And if pain or putrefaction is felt in their intestines, as often happens, then cauterize it with strong black wine, especially if the ulcer has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is easier to heal than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called the "jejunum" does not readily receive healing from a plague that afflicts it entirely; and this is because of the large number of veins in it and the size of those veins, and because of the delicate nature of its structure, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
However, if the affliction from the plague is tissue, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to the procedure you use for reducing intestines as well.
But if it has spread to that space and is already green or black, then you should squeeze it with a cloth over the area darkened by it, so that blood flows, because the tissue contains veins and arteries.
Then cut what is outside that ligament, and hang the two ends of the cloth down from the part below the plague, so that the pull of the plague from the tissue is relieved, and the spread of the plague is stopped.
A reminder of the plagues when they occur in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it is possible that it may be repaired in some people.  Therefore, I saw one who had been struck in the stomach with a lance; the plague was on the right side of the stomach, and the plague was old and had formed a fistula, and from it came gases and flatulence.
Then I considered the healing of it, though it wasn't focused on curing it, but I tried to subtlely heal it until the area was healed and the place was consolidated.
And once I saw the area healed, I told the patient that no further problems would occur in their stomach.  And nothing bad happened, they remained in their usual disposition, eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and was exercised as usual.
And some experienced people say that when a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it should be tied in this manner:  Take small, large-headed leeches.  Then bring together the two edges of the wound and place one of those leeches with its mouth open on the edges of the wound; when it has attached itself and is firmly holding the edges, sever its head, as it adheres and does not detach.
Then place another leech next to the first, and do not stop doing this with leeches, one after another, according to the size of the entire wound.
Then you bring them together and close the wound, and those leech heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed, and no harm comes to the patient.
And it is possible that the intestine be tied with a fine thread, which is made from the intestine of an animal similar to it, once it is threaded onto a needle; take the end of this thread, made from intestine, and carefully tie the end of it with another thread, wrapping it tightly.  Then thread the first thread through the needle, and using the needle, sew the intestine together, and return it to its proper position in the rupture.
This method of suturing with leeches is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it's in one of the delicate intestines, because then there is no true cure but merely a mitigation, and not a complete healing.
Of the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess that becomes old and chronic, and develops into an ulcer that does not heal and constantly discharges pus and is not surgically removed, then, wherever it may be on the body, is universally called a fistula, and we call it an ulcer.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, fibrous growth that causes no pain, and has a cavity like the cavity of a bird's nest; and for this reason we call that ulcer a "rized" ulcer, that is, a nest.
And in some people it is moist, which discharges pus; and often the moisture is discharged in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes large, and sometimes subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them and their treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you aware of the treatment of a fistula which is caused by surgical means using the hands.
And know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for some of them reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the spine, or the intestines, or the bladder, or some of the ribs, or some of the vertebrae of the back, or some of the joints formed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those that occur near the main part of the limb and similar structures.
Therefore, those fistulas of this type are among the illnesses with difficult healing, and do not receive a cure, and dealing with them is a labour and a display of ignorance.
And if any of the fistulas is not deep enough to reach these locations I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to achieve understanding of it, then take a probe or iron, and if the fistula is running in a straight line, explore it with that.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, due to its light weight, is more easily turned towards and follows the winding path.
And if the fistula has many horrors (i.e., is very complicated), it is not possible for you to make a diagnosis using a probe.
Then irrigate the openings with its openings, for the moisture with which you irrigate it will flow towards the other openings and run from them.
Then carefully inquire, in whatever way you can, to see if there are bones or nerves, and if the fistula's cavity is distant or near, or if it is a fistula with many openings and you are examining all of it with your full strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your pressing with your hand on the spot, and similar to the indications and accidental causes of an abscess.
And when you have established all those things with true judgment, then proceed to the cure according to your knowledge: and you must consider then if it is a superficial, close fistula, or in a saline location, distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the locations which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula according to what was previously said in the description of it, and remove whatever is in that filtration and decaying flesh, and whatever has grown in the opening of the flesh, or of pus and the like, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of deep origin, and is properly ascertained, then it must be incised as much as possible, and afterwards cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh. Then apply some bandages containing sharp medicaments, and place those inside the cavity of the fistula, which you have opened with an iron instrument.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains within the fistula's cavity of corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you shall probe and dry it as we have described, provided you do not impede any vein, nerve, or principal member as we have stated.
But if the bone is exposed and has some corruption or blackness, then you should scrape away this corruption until it is entirely removed; then heal it with something that causes flesh to grow until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and still bleeds as before, then know that you have not fully eradicated the corruption; therefore, you shall expose it a second time, carefully scrape and cleanse it thoroughly with your strongest tools, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, well and good; but if not, then know that the corruption is in a deeply hidden part of the body, which cannot be reached, and then you have no choice but to leave it be.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then you should remove it with delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously remove all of them, and leave no trace of them with your strength.
But if any difficulty arises from the humors, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then cut those ligaments or flesh, if present, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at once, then place something over the wound that can cover it, and leave it until the area around those bones of flesh and ligaments is free, and keep the wound from healing, and keep the incision you made in your operation from closing up.
However, if you fear, place on it cotton soaked in bruised olive oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments soften and the bones are separated from them, the removal, and the extraction of them, is eased.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone, or similar, and only the surface of it is corrupted, then scrape that with a rasp until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then close the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut that, and cut all the way to where the corruption has reached, and then treat that until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you can use this as an example and help in your operation.
There was a young man, about 30 years old, who suffered pain in his thigh.  And from the parts within, the disease spread through the body until it reached the thigh.  It was a matter of abscess, with a large abscess, and not an external cause.
And then the time was prolonged by the error of the doctors until the abscess opened, and many materials came out.  Its cure was nearly abandoned until the leg became fistulous, and many openings formed, which all discharged pus and bodily humors.
And then many doctors treated him for about two years, and none of them were skilled in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the materials that flowed from those openings, through great parts; and the man's body was already wasted away, and its color was yellow.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.
And I, quickly probing all the openings, found them extending from all parts of the leg.
And then I probed and incised one of those openings until I exposed a portion of the bone, and found it corrupted, already decayed and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, having penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sealed what I had uncovered and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I concluded that it was not in the bone, but that corruption which I had excised and sealed, and I had already cured it.
And then I applied restorative medicines to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I again probed and uncovered the bone, over the previous exposure, and found continued corruption alongside the bone.
And I sealed what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was forced to perform its treatment and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to cut into the bone little by little, specifically, forcing its restoration.  It was not restored until I cut around a palm's width of it, and extracted its marrow.  Then I restored it with medicines, and it is slightly consolidated and healed.
And further operations and incisions on it are not necessary, except for the weakness of the patient, and the patient's low tolerance and fear of death, because in such cases, fainting fits, or bad syncopes, occur at all hours due to excess evacuation.
And thus, it is healed completely, and there is nothing in place of the bone but hard flesh; and its condition in the body is now good, and its virtue returned; and it is restored to its proper functions and experiences no difficulty walking or in any other activity.
However, if the bone is protruding from the body, then you must cut it with this method:  take a bandage and tightly bind it to the end of that protruding bone, and instruct someone to pull it outward.  Then place a thicker wool bandage over the first one; and then tie this over the flesh that is beneath the bone, and pull the extremity so that it pulls the flesh inward, and you expose the flesh at the spot you want to cut so the cut does not damage the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board beneath the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And the cut should be made slowly over the decayed area, for if the decay is in the cavity of the bone and does not show in its surface, you may have to make another incision.
And if the bone is decayed but not protruding, and one part is continuous with the other, and the decay is in the middle or a portion of it, then you must expose the flesh completely on all sides; and then place wood beneath, and then cut from the first section where the decay is until the incision is extended to the other part.
And let the incision be precisely over the area of decay, as we have said.
And if the decay is in the joint, cut into that decayed joint and saw the bone where it is connected to the other part.
And if the decay is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not a rational, but rather an ingenious, problem.
And if the decay is in the wrist or ankle, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the decay in whatever way it appears to you, and expose it, and clean it according to any possible arrangement, and with every ingenious means, be rectified, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve.
And know that the incisions and saws for cutting these bones are very much dependent on the position of the bones, and their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their rarity; therefore, you must prepare instruments appropriate for each type of operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument you need; when great study, length of experience, and knowledge of the techniques of this art, and experience with illnesses, are yours, then you will already know what instruments are appropriate for each ailment.
And I am presenting to you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments that you will use, along with simple ones, to perform your procedure, which you will test on others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of ray: Let the head of this ray be shaped like a star-shaped keyhead, and its points be shaped like the points of an asterisk.
And it is only suitable that with that [ray/instrument] the heads of the joints be rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth [opening] is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a broader/flatter razor:
The shape of a well-made saw:  Its arch should be high and the sharpness of its iron, and its wooden member/handle should be a properly crafted dagger. Form/shape of it:
Shape of a razor with a concavity:
Another subtle/delicate shape of a razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved tip:
Shape of a small razor resembling a tendril/thread:
Shape of another smaller incisor:
Shape of another incisor; this one resembling a ray, and its tip is like a saw, and it is shown in many places in the reasoning about bones:
Shape of a ray that is suitable for the reasoning about the part of the bone that is perforated:
And its tip is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian steel, and similarly, all the things we have said about razors, incisions, and saws should be like this.
Of the incisive extremities and the serrations of the bones.
The extremities can be affected either by an internal cause or an external cause, or if your treatment of those afflictions with those medicines does not provide a cure, or if the affliction has moved to a limb that isn't affected by any external cause, then it is necessary for you to cut into that limb where the affliction has spread, so that the patient is spared from death or a worse condition caused by the limb's deterioration.
And the sign of that which afflicts the limb is that the limb turns black, as if fire had already burned it, or there is a spreading blackness throughout the limb causing it to become stiff and to affect the whole body.  Then, cut it with an incision.
And similarly, if the affliction is caused by the sting of venomous creatures, such as scorpions, vipers, or other similar ones.
And if the affliction or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger and do not allow the affliction to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if it reaches the hand, then you cut it at the base of the forearm, and do not allow the affliction to spread to the forearm.
And if instead of that, then cut the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the affliction passes beyond the elbow, then in that case, death of the patient is certain; and to administer any other remedy for this is a waste of effort.
And similarly, do the same for the foot. When the affliction reaches the toe of the foot, then you cut it down to one of the bones (or joints).
And if it spreads to the sole of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you cut the leg down to the knee joint.
And if the affliction has already reached the knee, then there is no cure but release, and leaving the patient to death.
And the method of cutting or severing the limb is that you should grasp the ligament in the area just below the part you want to cut, and grasp another ligament over the spot.  The attendant should extend a ligament downwards, and extend another ligament upwards.  Then you separate the flesh which lies between the two ligaments, spreading it wide, until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be cut or severed.
And it is necessary to place cloth on all sides so that the area does not touch, and that the patient receives a suitable and carefully applied inflammation/abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while working, then you cauterize the cut area promptly, or place some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your procedure until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man on his foot, this same accident which I and you have recounted, which is that he suffered blackness on his foot from a burn that resembled a fire's combustion.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it affected his entire foot.
And then that man prepared himself, because he saw the healing of the limb proceeding with the intensity of the pain and burning he felt, and he incised that foot to the joint, and [the foot] was healed.
For a long time, that same corruption happened to him in the finger of his index hand.
Then he came to me, and I was compelled to counteract that excess with what I put on his hand in the process of purifying his body; and although the excess was not repelled, it began to spread to the other fingers, until it started to affect his entire hand.
And he urged me to cut his hand, but I did not want to do so, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and more than that, I feared the death of his hand from the incision, for the vitality of the patient was failing.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and it came to my attention that that man prepared himself and cut his entire hand, and it was healed.
And I have not presented this account except so that it may be helpful in understanding this illness, and that it may serve as a sign by which it may be recognized and treated according to its nature.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy part of the body, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it collects pus, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the pus is discharged, and the area remains empty like a vessel, and the skin covering it is like a thin cloth, and it has not progressed to a deeper corruption, and it does not involve the bone, nerve, or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption affects any part of the body, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment of it is to cut away that skin completely, just as it has been rolled up, especially when it is thin and like a cloth, and to make sure that it does not adhere to the affected area due to its corruption.
However, if you suspect that the skin is adhering and that the corruption has not yet reached a deeper layer, and there is a visible opening in the skin, then you treat it with an enema.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large and the pus that comes from it has a foul odor, then irrigate it with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of oil, sour wine, and vinegar, taken in equal parts, combined in a vessel, and heated over the fire until the medicine becomes reddish and attains the consistency of honey.
Then take what is necessary of this, dissolve it in water and honey; and irrigate the sinus with that, and constrict the opening, and leave the medicine in place for about two hours.
Then remove that with care; and do this for as many days as necessary until the sinus is cleansed and the odor has disappeared.
And sometimes it is irrigated with ash water, if this medicine is not available to you; and you should take the ashes of wood, put water over it, then strain it and irrigate the sinus with it until you are confident that the sinus is healed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then irrigate with water and honey mixed with crushed vinegar, and irrigate with wine and honey mixed, because honey's property is to cleanse and wash, and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially if the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are confident that the sinus is healed, then irrigate it with something that promotes the growth of flesh there.
And you should take a diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or irrigate it with other medicines and ointments that have the properties I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so the enema tube cannot be inserted, then widen it little by little with a small iron, and apply a poultice wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the edges together with a suture and leave it a size that allows the enema tube to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the pus drains is raised, then you should lower it to the lowest part so that the pus drains downwards, because when the pus is confined deep within the sinus, the flesh will not grow there.
And if you cannot lower the sinus to the desired lower bone, then you must prepare the limb with a treatment that allows the pus to flow easily, according to your resources, and that no cause within it is obstructing the pus.
But the one that is over the sinus opening, which remains in place constantly so that what is contained within the sinus may drain. And so that you may know whether the drainage from the limb is profuse or meager, or digested or undigested.
And by this, consider the location of the sinus, if the patient feels pain there, and if there is an abscess there.
And when your treatment continues in this manner, and you see that the material discharged over the sinus opening has adhered, or is about to adhere, then you should remove it on the third day, and when you remove the scab, change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if a subtle, thin virus is spreading from the sinus, then do not be discouraged by the adherence, for healing is likely to take place; for some individuals have slow tissue regeneration in their wounds, and others have the opposite.
And if undigested pus has been draining from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the sinus' adherence is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying properties of the medicines.  And if the medicines are moist in their substance and virtue, they are made dry, like a diaphanous ointment, when there is superfluous addition of drying agents.
And the final remedy, with which it is healed, is to take diaphanous ointment, dissolve it in rose oil, and add old, well-preserved wine to its substance. Then mix this together and use it.
And similarly in that action, when there is no pus, use diaphanous ointment, or honey, when it has been heated until thickened, and apply it.  Or, take myrrh, aloes, and incense, crush and powder them, and sprinkle them onto heated honey until thickened, and apply this mixture to a cloth and compress it over the sinus;  or apply the thickened honey to a cloth and compress that.
Sometimes, long, thin aristolochia roots and the roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and the flour of eryngo and centaury are administered along with these.  Crush these simple ingredients, sieve them, and sprinkle the powder onto the honey previously mentioned; use this.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the deeper parts of it, and is affecting the bones or other hard parts of the body, or ligaments.  Then treat it with a fistulous cure, as described above.
Of the treatment of whitlow (or felon), and of damaged nails, and of the incision of an affected finger, and of the sectioning (or cutting).
Whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of a finger of the hand or foot, and frequently arises on other fingers.  When it is prolonged, and its cure is less easily achieved, it is either an abscess that boils over, or it is corrupt and discharges pus, until it corrodes the base of the nail, and often corrupts the entire nail.  Often its corruption spreads to the bone, until it has a foul odour, and the end of the finger becomes necrotic, and the colour is blackened.
And therefore, when you have done as we have said in the division and your treatment is not successful, then it is necessary to cut away all the excess nail material with a knife, and then cauterize the wound immediately afterward, for cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is healthy and the nail is sound, and the nail's debris now is pressing on the surrounding flesh, and begins to fester and inflame it, then it is necessary that you insert a thin probe under the nail, to where it is pricking the flesh, and lift it and incise that flesh easily, and apply to what remains of the flesh burning and corrosive medicines until it is all gone; and then treat with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary for you to cut the bone and remove it, for a corrupt bone in such a state is never healed.
And if sometimes the corrosion and corruption spread to the finger, then you should cut it at one of its joints according to the likelihood of its recovery, and subsequently treat it until it is healed.
However, if the nail suffers a blow or friction, and intense pain results, then it is necessary to first open up the veins of the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse incision from top to bottom, but be careful not to reach the flesh underneath, for you will cause the patient extreme pain, and it may cause a swelling of excess flesh to form in the area; and afterwards treat that area with whatever alleviates the pain.
However, a swollen finger, which is often found on the hands of some people, is frequently fleshy, and frequently located on the bones, or frequently found on the nailbed.
And some are born at the base of the joint, or the formation of them is in some of the joints of the fingers. However, that which is born in some joints of the finger is not bad, and that which is born in the joints is easily/commonly inflamed/bad.
And for those that are fleshy growths, the incision is light, and you should cut it near its roots with a broad/flat blade.
But for that which is born at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, beware of excising it.
But for that which is born on a finger near the joints, you must first cut through the flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, then close it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then treat it until it is healed.
However, if a thickening occurs on the fingers, either through birth defects, or from a wound's healing, a burn, or similar causes, then the thickening must be removed until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in warm oil to prevent them from healing too quickly, and separate them or place a thin lead sheet between them until they heal properly.
And similarly, if thickening occurs on the fingers with the palm of the hand, then you remove that thickening according to the preparation and the proper form of the limb.
Of incisions of veins, these are varicose veins.
Veins are varicose, which are twisted, large veins full of melancholic superfluities that appear in many parts of the body, but most commonly in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But the cure of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are incised and that black blood is drawn out, and the other method is that the vein is elevated and completely extracted.
The sectioning of it is done in this way: first, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, phlegmatic blood in the leg is dissolved.  Then, tightly bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh down to the area below the knee with a bandage.  Then, cut the vein at one, two, or three points with a wide incision. Next, elevate the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and downwards, until the desired amount of blood has been drawn out, and it will reduce the patient's malady.
And then, tie it up, and command the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and this is beneficial to the patient.
But the elevation of them is done in this way: you lift the patient's leg, if it is very swollen, and then put it in a bath and soak the leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins are prominent. Or, if a bath is unavailable, exercise the limb vigorously until it is warmed.
And then, cut the sinew on the vein's side, either along or behind it, from the knee down, or at the lowest point of the heel.
And then, open the sinew with hooks and scrape the vein on all sides until it is exposed, and this is determined by a reddish color declining to a blackness.
And thus, when you open it, from the sinew you see that white thing which is like a cord.
And then you place a ray (or, possibly, a wedge) under it until it is raised and pulled away from the sinew, and suspend it with a hook or forceps.
And then make another incision near the first one, wait three days, and then scrape the sinew from the part above the vein until it is exposed.
And then elevate that and cut it in a second incision towards the ankle, and then pull it out and elevate it until it comes out through the second incision, and then pull it out of the incision above it.
Do this until you pull it out of the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until all of it is out; and then cut it.
And if you are unable to pull it out and elevate it, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and tie it, and pull it out, or insert a wedge underneath it and move your hand in all directions until it is pulled out. And be careful that it is not cut; for if it is broken, it will be difficult to elevate it much and it will cause harm to the patient.
And when you have completely removed it, then place on the affected area wool soaked in wine and oiled and unoiled oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having twists and turns to which it is wrapped, and is not straight as we said, then you must cut open the twist and the wrappings, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it completely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and harm it, for it will be difficult to lift it; and exercise your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not sharp like hooks, nor is it acutely pointed, so as not to injure the vein; and it is of considerable flexibility, lest, if it were subtle, it would cut the vein due to its thinness;  however, it has the appropriate thickness as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like in the land of the Arabs, and in the hot and arid lands of India, where little vegetation grows.
And it is easily produced in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation comes from the putrefaction that lies beneath the skin, like snakes, worms, and insects that generate between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this [condition] is a violent inflammation in the leg where this vein appears; and soon the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the spot of that blister, appearing like the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap a piece of lead around it, weighing one drachm, or two drachms, and bind it, and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as any cause of it is found in the external parts, wrap it in lead and bind it. And if it is prolonged, then you should cut off a portion of it and wrap the remainder, and do not cut into the root of it until it has come entirely out, because if you cut into it, it is constricted and enters the flesh, causing abscess and swelling at the location, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from behind it, and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein, some men have had it extend to five palms and ten fingers, and it has come to my attention that one extended to twenty palms.
And if it is incised during its treatment, then insert a rod into its cavity and pierce it with a long instrument, until everything within the material is evacuated, and apply poultices to the area for several days using medicines; and then treat it as one would treat an abscess.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears near the joint of the foot or on the foot, and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening.
And thus treat it as we have described in the division and with what has been previously stated.
Of the sectioning of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called bovine illness in some lands near us, because it often affects livestock, and is a small worm which is born between the skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, up and down, and is felt by its movement from limb to limb until it bursts through the skin and escapes.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, serpents, maggots, and ascarids are produced in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it travels in the body and is raised to the head, and reaches the eye, then it strongly swells there and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is not done except by following its movement and appearance to the touch, and then it is necessary to tightly bind and constrict that which is above and below it, and then to cut above it and extract it.
And if it is hidden in the flesh and you cannot find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the greatest cause to be feared is its corruption, which corrupts the area as we have said.
And if you see that creature having reached the head near the eye, then press on the brow with strong pressure, and then cut above it, and extract it; and it is necessary for the patient to use methods to cleanse their body of bad, putrid humors, and to avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the incision upon the illness (or affliction).
This illness is called "nafir" in our land, and it is a pain which comes upon certain limbs, and then moves from one limb to another.
And I have already seen that, as I have told you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm. After remaining there for an hour, I saw that swelling move like a worm climbing, but more quickly than a worm could, as if it were living silver moving from place to place.
And then the pain went to that place and settled in the muscle, and then I stayed there for an hour.
And then it moved to the other arm until it reached the other arm.
And then it returned to me, that it moved throughout her body as I saw; and I was greatly amazed by its movement and the speed from limb to limb. And I had already seen this before with my own eyes in that way, however, I have seen many cases where pain moves from limb to limb. But I did not see this with my own eyes in this way as in the woman.
And I did not consider it to be anything other than because the woman was old, with dry body and exposed veins, and in this state the moving wind appeared to the senses.
And it is necessary that this type of remedy not appear in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to you with your eyes as we have said.  Then, lightly and gently press on it until that confined wind is released, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with body purging and with remedies that expel winds, and alleviate them with foul-smelling pills and with pills of herbs and similar ones.
Of the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types, and according to the parts of the body they pierce, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small, and concave, and blunt, that is, solid; and some have three angles, and some have tongues; and some have feathers.
And the signs of the brain are when an arrow strikes it, pierces the skull, and exits the cranium, which is above the brain, for there is a sudden violent accident, and fainting, dizziness, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion of thought and vomiting of bile, and the speech is often severed and the voice is lost, and a white humidity resembling dust comes out of the wound, and the area around it resembles the liquefaction of flesh.
Therefore, if these signs appear to you, then you refrain from the treatment and extraction of the arrow, unless it is on the surface.
But the signs of an arrow striking the heart, when it is near the left breast, are that it feels as if something hard, and not empty, has been thrust into the place; and often the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and the patient feels cold in the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; therefore, know that death is certain without a doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are the outflow of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck become inflamed, and the patient's color changes, and he exhales heavily, and desires the intake of cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the diaphragm, which is in the chest, the pain is then near the small ribs, and a great tremor occurs with violent pain and sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then quite often undigested food comes forth from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is lodged within, there is some fissure or rupture of the tissue, or the bowel is torn, and there is no hope for the cure without the removal of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine leaks out, and some cause of this proceeds to the outside parts, and severe pain affects the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, and throat, shoulders and arms, the vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar limbs, are preserved according to their major dispositions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery, and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I relate this to you, what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may interpret it for your own treatment.
The reason for this is that in a man, an arrow struck the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, under the ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the socket of his eye, beneath the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already embedded, and only a small tip with which it adhered to its shaft was recovered.  It was a large, pointed arrow, like those used by the Turks, with a lion's head at the tip and no feathers.
And the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had been lodged in his throat. It was an Arab arrow, the kind with feathers.  It had already sunk into his throat; and so I carefully worked around it, and then extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his abdomen, and I thought he would die because of it.  However, after 30 days had passed and no change had occurred in his condition, I cut around the arrow and worked to remove it.  He was healed, and no further harm came to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his back, and the wound had healed.  But after approximately seven years, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow had lodged in her abdomen. The wound had healed within her, and there was no change in her condition. The woman experienced no harm in any of her natural bodily functions.
And I saw another man in whose face an arrow had lodged, and the wound had healed.  The arrow remained, causing not much pain, and many similar cases like this one.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's prince's man, which had lodged in the middle of his nose and had already slightly deviated to the right side.  The entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow's lodging, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; and then I probed it with a delicate probe, and felt nothing; but he felt a prickling beneath his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was from the arrow's tip.
And I applied a poultice to the area, containing virtues of attraction and digestion, confident that the area would become inflamed so that the arrowhead would appear to me, so that it would dry up on that spot.
And no significant accident occurred at the site to suggest that the arrowhead had entered that location; and I continued with the poultice on him for many days, and no accident occurred; and meanwhile, the wound healed, and the patient remained free from the procedure's effects for many days until one day he felt the arrowhead inside his nose and reported this to me.
Then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up, and with the probe I tested it, and found the slender arrowhead, which was still attached to the shaft.
And then I gradually exposed the wound through the application of that sharp medicine until the arrowhead's tip became visibly apparent to me, and I spent time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, as the wound had become inflamed, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and it remained, and did not yield to this approach, then I did not stop refining and devising methods, until one day, I used the forceps, skillfully made (as their design will be shown at the end of this chapter), to remove it; and then I healed the wound.
Some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose was not repairable, but I restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient was completely healthy, and suffered no further harm from it.
And I recount to you the method of removing some arrows, so that you may consider this a rule and understanding of what I have not said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of it cannot be fully grasped by narration, nor does the book fully encompass them.
And skilled craftsmen compare the little with the much; and what is present with what is absent; and they discover new operations and instruments for removing foreign bodies in the art when such an accident occurs.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the members in which they are lodged except in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered; or by pushing from the other side.
And that which is expelled from the place where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled out and expelled.
And if you do not follow this procedure at the time of extraction, then you should leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and the extraction and expulsion of the arrow is facilitated.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow the procedure, leave it for several days and repeat the extraction with pulling and movement each day, and it will be expelled.
And if you do not follow the procedure for several days, then you must make a small incision around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine drill until the arrow's lodging is enlarged, and then extract it.
However, if the arrow is concealed within the body's tissues, and is hidden from sight, then you should search for it with a probe, and if you sense it, then pull it out with suitable tools for its removal.
And if you cannot do so due to the tightness of the wound and the arrow's depth, and if there is no bone, nerve, or vein involved, then you should spread the wound until it is widened and the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is lodged in the ears, then you should carefully separate the flesh in which it is lodged from all sides, using all your skill; and work on it until, if you cannot loosen the flesh around the fractured and twisted ear, it yields.
And when you are removing the arrow from any location, then use twisting motions of your hand with forceps on all sides until you force it to yield; and with utmost care, ensure the arrow does not break and that its extraction is not difficult for you.
And if you cannot remove it immediately, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have calmed, and then attempt its removal again when it is less inflamed. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then apply the treatments described in our chapter on healing.
And be cautious in cutting veins, nerves, or tendons, and employ every possible means to remove the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, patience, and firmness, as I have described.
And thus pull the arrow in the opposite direction to that in which the wound was created by the arrowhead, because this is more helpful. But if that is not possible, then apply whatever remedies are possible according to these methods.
However, if the arrowheads are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow is already outside the wound, or if the arrowhead's tip is curved from the point of impact on the deeper tissue, then you should make an incision over that. The incision should be in proportion to the size the forceps can grasp; then pull it out, for it will become more easily extracted.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead enters the bone, and expands it, then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is also there, then you push it out with it.
But if the shaft is lodged and you want to administer a push, then you insert a curved instrument so that the curve enters the cavity of the arrowhead and the shaft, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrowhead is eased by that.
And if the arrowhead is poisoned, then you must excavate all the flesh in which the arrowhead is lodged, if possible, and then treat it with whatever is appropriate.
And if the arrowhead lodges in the foot, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to injure a vein or nerve, remove it, and then cauterize the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which the arrows are extracted:
Let their extremities be like the beak of a bird, shaped like a saw, so that they grasp the arrow firmly and do not let go.
And of those [forceps] there are many varieties, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and the constriction of the area.
So that the instrument is easily extracted from the arrow's cavity and is pushed out with it.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which there are thirty customary ones, are described in chapter sixteen.  These include two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the two visible temples; two veins in the two eye sockets, called *aspicientz*; the vein situated in the middle of the forehead; the vein located at the tip of the nose; two veins at the collarbone; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip; the veins called *algelic*; and two veins below the tongue. However, the veins to be bled in the arms are five.  One is the cephalic vein, which lies beside the wild side of the arm; the people call it "the head vein," and it is a middle vein, composed of a branch of the basilica vein and another branch of the cephalic vein.  The people call it "the vein of the entire body".  The basilica vein lies on the domestic side of the arm, and is called "citillar", and the common people call it "the belly vein". There is also the vein of the arm, located above the elbow; it is the one bled and the one that appears conspicuously on the surface. There is also the salvatella, which lies between the index finger and the little finger, and is in two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins. One of them is located below the bend of the knee on the wild side of the leg; the second is called *sophena*, and its location is below the leg on the domestic side; the third is the sciatic vein, located below the leg on the wild side; and there are other veins in the leg similar to these.
The bleeding of veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, dizziness, and ancient sores/ulcers of the head.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is to first gently press the patient's head, and rub the patient's head at the back of the head (occipital region) in the place of both veins with a wide cloth using good friction; then gently press the patient's neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations, which are near the ears in two slightly indented spots on the head, appear; feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, then proceed with the lancet.
Then take the lancet, which is the sharp one, and insert it below the vein along the groove until the bleeding reaches the bone. Then lift your hand along the vein and groove to the upper parts and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And make the incision the length of about two fingers, or thereabouts; and let the blood flow out as much as you desire.
Then apply compresses and leave them until it is healed.
And already in the beginning of the book was described the incision of these things and their cauterization.
But for the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the relief from phlebotomy is for chronic headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and the flow of acute excess humours to the eyes.
And the method of phlebotomizing those veins is as I recommend to you: hold the patient's neck until the two veins are clearly visible and the pulse of each can be felt below your finger; then you should tie them off with a ligature.
And then you raise the skin over the vein with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and elevate the vein upward; and cut it just as you did the other two veins; and allow the blood to flow according to your need.
And then release the patient's neck restraint, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then apply a compress and powder to that spot and tightly bind it, and leave it until it is healed.
And the remembrance of their (the veins') location, and the incision and drawing (of blood), has already been described at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the treatment of phlebotomy of the vein on the forehead is appropriate for treating old facial ailments, migraines, stiff necks, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is as I recommend to you:  the patient should bind their neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument, which is called a "fossor," of which this is its form:
Place the pointed end of the lancet, which is at the head of the "fossor," on that vein, and press on it with a weight or other hand-held object in the manner of it, and let the blood flow according to the amount desired; and then release the patient's neck restraint, and bind the area until healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, but the phlebotomy should not be made with a sharp edge like the other phlebotomies, but with a blunt edge, and phlebotomize that one transversely, for the bone is very hard and fragile; if the phlebotomy is made sharply, the bone would break there.
But the treatment of the two veins situated near the tear ducts is for eye scabies, eye inflammation, and eye ulcers, and for facial ailments.
And the method of phlebotomy is that the patient should tie their neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over their head.
And the phlebotomy should be made transversely, with a somewhat elongated, shallow incision, for there is no muscle in that area; and if the phlebotomy is sharp, the edge of it will easily break.
And then allow the blood to flow as much as is necessary, and place compresses over them, and bind them tightly for one night, and then loosen them.
But phlebotomy of the nasal vein is beneficial for acute fevers and severe headaches, and for facial ailments, and migraines and inflammation that occur on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the method of phlebotomy for this is that the patient should hold their neck and then you should hold their nose with your left hand, and take the sharp lancet and insert it into the center of the bridge of the nose along a straight line, since the vein is not visible here, and the blood begins to flow immediately.
You should slowly move the small lancet with your hand and allow the blood to flow according to your needs; and then tie it up for one night, because it heals easily.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins leads to relief from constriction of the breath and the onset of leprosy, and many diseases, and impetigo, and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the method of phlebotomy for those is that the patient should hold each vein below their neck with a bandage; and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a chair.
Then, phlebotomize the vein along its length with a wide lancet, little by little; and then extract blood in a moderate quantity, or according to the perceived need; and then do the same with the other vein.
Then, loosen the bandage and tie the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not harmed, and leave it until morning, for the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the veins alleviates small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are on the nose and around it.
And the method of phlebotomy for those is to make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage, and then open their lips and look for two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the second on the left; and the sign of each is the blackness of each of them, and this is because in the surrounding area there are many small black veins; and then cut each one with a cut/incision.
But if there is doubt, and you do not know which one is which, then you should cut the largest and most obvious of those veins.
And do the same for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
However, for two veins located below the tongue, the treatment of choice is phlebotomy of the cephalic veins near the throat, for conditions affecting the uvula, and for illnesses of the mouth.
The method of performing phlebotomy on those veins is to position the patient between your hands, facing the sun, raise the patient's tongue, and look beneath the tongue, for the vein on one side and the vein on the other side.  The colour of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to press too hard when phlebotomizing them, for beneath those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized at the elbow are those that are customarily treated in all men, and their phlebotomy is performed in two ways: either with a lancet or olive-shaped phlebotomy knife,  gradually becoming thinner; or with a scalpel, and called the "alnessil", and this is its form:
Its blade should be as sharp as possible, and it is suitable for opening concave, full veins that appear large, and those containing thick, clotted blood.
This phlebotomy tool has a smaller width and a more delicate tip, and is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins containing subtle, citrus-like blood.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it draws blood from illnesses located under the neck and collarbone, and from what affects the feet and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on this vein, to be very careful and cautious, for there is an artery beneath it.  If he errs and misjudges the phlebotomy puncture, he will cut into that artery and cause a flow of blood.  Therefore, one should not puncture this vein with a sharp phlebotomy tool, but rather cut it with a scalpel-like instrument.
And if the basilic vein is not readily apparent, then you should leave it and move to another vein, or seek a branch of it.  Or you may perform phlebotomy on the outer part of the arm, for that is visible; and cut it with a scalpel-like phlebotomy tool, as we have said.
However, if you want to perform phlebotomy on that same vein, then before the arm's constriction, touch the area until you locate the pulse point, and then press on it firmly.  Then, bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel-like phlebotomy tool, as we have said.  And take care that the incision is a short distance from any artery.
And when you compress the ligament, if you see swelling in the area you marked with pressure, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and reddish, then know that it is blood from the artery.  Then you should stop and place your finger over that area for a long time.  Then remove your finger, and if the blood has stopped, as often happens, then you should bind the arm and leave it be.
And watch the patient's condition, and be mindful of him, and do not neglect him for some days until he is healed.
However, if the blood does not stop flowing, and you see that you have no suitable medicine for this, then you should cut the artery, if it appears to you; because the extremity is constricted and blood flow is stopped.  Or you could take bark from a fig tree, grind it, and take one half and press it on the vein area, using a constricting bandage and powder until the following day.
And if the blood has stopped, good; and if not, then treat that with what is mentioned in the description of powders that stop blood flow.
And stopping the blood flow from that area is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of the arm being bound.
But from the deep vein, phlebotomy is beneficial by drawing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And it is important for the phlebotomist to be careful during phlebotomy, because below that vein is a nerve; and if the phlebotomist inserts the lancet and finds the nerve, the patient will experience shock, and healing will be difficult, and often the wound will not heal completely.  This nerve is frequently palpable; but if it is hidden from some people and is subtle and not visible, then you should use a phlebotomy lancet made of well-tempered steel, and avoid the nerve with your skill and strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and relieves ailments of the eyes.
And it is best, if you wish to perform phlebotomy, to use an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped lancet; for it is the safest of all veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve below it.
However, it is quite easy for an abscess to form in some men if not lanced on the first percussion, but do not pierce into that abscess.
The first thing you must know is that phlebotomy is performed for the preservation of health and as a means of preventing illness, and it should be done on one of the veins of the arm, that is: the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, after a fast in spring and autumn, and in winter close to the meal, when signs of congestion appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day, or at least three hours after the procedure.
But phlebotomy should only be performed when there is a clear need and appropriateness for it, whether by night or by day, at all times and in all circumstances.
And a child should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled until the fourth month and no later than the seventh, and the elderly, who are over sixty years old, should not be bled.
And if someone wants to be bled, regardless of the reason, they should cleanse their bowels beforehand with a lion's-clister, if they have a lot of retained waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the bowels during the phlebotomy, which are unclean, and which do not harm the major organs.
And those suffering from nausea, fever, or drunkenness, or those recovering from illness or intoxication, should not be bled until this has subsided, nor those suffering from dropsy; and phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, increased sexual activity and exertion, or strenuous activities, fasting, or vigils, and any other activity that weakens the body or spirit.
And beforehand, consider the nature of the humors by examining the blood; if it is thick, use foods and drinks, and if possible, medication to address this.
And if no reason prevents it, one should enter a bath, or engage in some form of exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
And perform the phlebotomy on the patient in the morning, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful emotional states, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily stresses, such as strenuous exertion, unnecessary effort, sexual activity, and similar things.
And near the patient, have present the things that are customarily used by people for their aromatic and fragrant properties, such as balsams and similar substances, in the quantity that is possible.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the person who is to be bled.
Then, the phlebotomist should pull up their arm, and rub it with their hand two or three times; then, tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it around twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not tight enough, or if it is too tight, then bleeding is prohibited; or if it is too loose, then the flow of blood is also prohibited.
And near the constriction, it is necessary for the person being bled to rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and evident to the touch.
And then the phlebotomist should anoint the phlebotomy tool with a little ancient oil; and then place the index finger of their left hand on that vein, below the location where they want to make the phlebotomy, so that the vein slightly recedes, and the throbbing stops, because veins are like a cord fleeing from the phlebotomy; and of those that are full of air, when the phlebotomist places the phlebotomy tool on it, the vein contracts towards the phlebotomy and thus the phlebotomist is successful; and the phlebotomy does not open the vein, and if it does, the vein is too constricted.
Therefore, for this reason, the phlebotomist must be careful and diligent in all these matters.
And then, if the vein is opened in one attempt, that is good; and if not, repeat this procedure slightly below that spot, or above it with speed, if the location is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for a strong pull will cause a hot abscess, nor should they bathe.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out as desired, then you repeat the phlebotomy in that same puncture, gently adjusting the opening a little, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, because the area becomes inflamed in many people with small openings.
But if the area is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not serve any purpose; and place on that area a little piece of linen soaked in oil, for it relieves the flow of blood. And oil is better for this area than other oils.
Similarly, apply a linen soaked in oil to every phlebotomy site.  This is done to prevent the flow of blood from being excessive, and the use of theriac, aloes, and saffron when applied to the area helps make the blood thinner and more manageable when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the phlebotomy site, as often happens, especially in those who have not been bled before or if the vein opening is small, then you must apply a compress. Place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the area and press firmly for an hour, for this will help it dissolve.
And this should be done close to where the blood is exiting from that vein, with the help of a helper or another vein (to maintain the flow, perhaps).
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the area for a few days, do not be concerned.  If you wish, apply a mixture of aloe and myrrh, or something like mint or balm extract.
And many times, abscesses and swellings occur due to phlebotomy on the basilic vein.
Therefore, place your hand on it, and if you find softness under your pressure, that swelling is malignant and dangerous;  then be careful to apply something like what we've described, for blood will easily flow from the artery.
Make a poultice with something astringent to harden the area, and then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
And it is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their strength and according to the color and appearance of the blood.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one instance, that the phlebotomy from the vein be extensive and wide.
And for someone who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw it out in small amounts, and that the opening be small.
And the best method in vein-opening (phlebotomy) is a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safer from blood flow and nerve damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy along the vein's length and width.
And for those who are prone to fainting after bloodletting, it is necessary to treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in wine of pomegranates or simple heated vinegar; and remove the blood in three or four stages.
And if the condition is due to coldness, then before the bloodletting, give bread soaked in myrrh syrup, or honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar, or a fragrant and strongly scented syrup.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is caused by the rapid outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water from cooked meat and very fragrant, delicate syrup; and use aromatics like camphor, and soak his feet in it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wishes to treat their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, it is appropriate for the bloodletting to be a gradual evacuation, and its effect is slow, to remove the blood little by little, according to the amount of the medicine over the continuing days.
But whoever wishes to treat their arm, and to let blood a second time, and their body is strong, then do so approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But whoever wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite part where it is flowing, it is necessary that it be treated on the second or third day.
However, in a body where there is already much heated blood, and it is congested and causing fever, it is necessary to remove a large quantity of blood at once, and to increase the procedure until fainting occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand on the pulse near the blood vessel, to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant and careless.
And it is not appropriate, when you wish to open the arm and evacuate blood a second time, as the vein opening is now closed and the blood's exit is difficult, for you to press forcefully and stretch the arm slightly bent, for that is too harmful.
Having left it until it is blood-let a second time; or else, deal with the blood clotting in the vein opening; or place theriac or sagenae over it, and press it gently until the blood has escaped.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you draw blood from that location or from the other arm, from another vein.
And the vein called "the arm's cord" is opened instead of the cephalic or basilic vein, when these are not found or are hidden, for it is made up of those.
And the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the vein becomes red and clearly visible.
And then apply pressure to it with a moderate constriction; and then make the incision across the vein, not lengthwise or transversely.
And make the opening wide, and your incision for the bloodletting should be slightly above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is stopped, then you re-immerse the hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your need.
But if you are in the summer, then you are excused from immersing the hand in warm water, and it is acceptable to place the body in warm water during the winter.
And bloodletting from this vein is safer than from any other vein, for below it there is no pulsating vein or nerve.
And bloodletting from the vein in the right wrist is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
And the procedure for bloodletting there is that you should hold the wrist with a bandage or your hand, after placing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then make a transverse incision on that vein; and if you cut it completely, that will do no harm.
And be careful not to extend your incision too far with the bloodletting, for beneath it are the nerves of the exposed fingers.
And then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow from it, for if you don't return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be prohibited.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the necessary amount, then you place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not become firmly closed; and similarly, you should do this at all narrow passages.
However, bloodletting from the left hand is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen.
And do likewise in the bloodletting of him (or her) as you did in the other (hand).
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the mother (likely the uterus), and retention of menses, and for ailments of the kidneys and ulcers of the thighs and legs (chronic ones), and similar ailments.
And the procedure for bloodletting from him is that the patient should immerse their foot in warm water and rub it until the veins are clearly visible; and bandage the area around the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein that is clearly visible just above the toe, from there branches out into many small vessels along the surface of the foot.
And therefore, make the incision into the largest vein, either lower on the leg towards the heel, or closer to the joining point, for it is better and more beneficial.
And if you make the incision on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath the surface of the foot, and make your incision across the vein, as if you were intending to cut it in half.
And let the bloodletting be done carefully.
But if the release of blood is prohibited, then you should repeatedly immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow from it until it is evacuated.
And if the bloodletter makes a mistake on the first attempt, then repeat the procedure a little further, for the location is beneficial; and do not fear harming the patient, but rather, be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly, do the same for the vein of the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, under the bone of the outer part.
And the benefit of the bloodletting for him is for pain in the hip when it is caused by hot blood.
And the procedure for his bloodletting is that the patient should enter a bath, and tightly wrap the thigh on the outside from above the heel for four days with a long, thin bandage, for it appears only through this.
And therefore, when it appears, then you should perform bloodletting of that vein, according to any technique possible and in the best way possible, or you cut it using incision or a cut, for its location is sensitive.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear at all by touch, then perform bloodletting on any branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot, above the so-called auricular and annular parts.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow out in the quantity you desire.
And then loosen the constriction and place a compress over the bloodletting site and tightly bandage the area, for it will heal quickly.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping is of horns, or of earth, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with incision and the removal of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping that is administered with incision and blood removal is applied to fourteen places on the body, of which one is at the back of the head; the middle place is on the two sides of the neck together;  and cupping on the chin below the jaw and below the mouth; and cupping on both shoulder blades; and cupping on the collarbone, and it is above the end of the breastbone; and cupping on the two elbows, and they are on the two arms; and cupping on the two forearms; and cupping on both thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood from major veins, but rather from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not deplete the strength of those veins, as is the case with phlebotomy; nor should cupping with or without fire be done in any disease caused by fullness until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity prompts cupping for an illness or for a chronic condition, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end, and in the middle of the month, and at any time.
And therefore, when any of these conditions arise, especially if it is in the middle or third of the month, then we recommend cupping to be done after two or three hours have passed.
Cupping the nape of the neck is beneficial when it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is affecting the eyes; however, this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the location of a phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not recommended for someone with a cold or catarrh to use it, as it causes them significant harm.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly, or those with cold illnesses, to use it.
But for those who are continuously being treated in this manner, it is harmful;  therefore, you must instruct the cupper to slightly reposition their hand below the cup, in order to prevent the generation of harmful effects.
But cupping with alcohol is in the location of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and basilica veins:  and thus it is beneficial for asthma, constriction of the windpipe,  rupture of the windpipe, coughing, and congestion.
And the alcohol cup should be slightly elevated, for if placed too low it will generate weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* is beneficial for accidental head pains, ophthalmia, migraines, fever, and toothache; and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And you must instruct the cupper not to press their hand with excessive force when scarifying, so as not to cut the artery and cause bleeding.
And cupping under the chin is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth, and gum decay, and similar mouth ailments, and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the veins in the lips.
But cupping performed above the two shoulder blades is beneficial for heatstroke, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two sides within the armpits is equivalent to the phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilica, the cephalic, and the median cubital vein; because it draws blood from all those smaller veins within the flesh, and these small veins draw from the larger veins until the suction is carried out to the three main veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply with the scarification, because the area is lacking in flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping used on the buttocks is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and sores beneath them.
And you must tell the cupper to use a large, well-made cupping glass, because the area requires a strong suction; and weak, flimsy cupping glasses are easily broken and should not be used for scarification.
But cupping on the legs is less effective due to its clear limitations, for it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and uterus, and it can bring on menstruation, benefit from boils, and inflammations.  It is a substitute for bloodletting from two veins, and then a remedy for various ailments.
However, it often weakens the entire body and causes fainting in many people.
And the benefit of cupping in these cases is similar to the benefit of cupping on both legs.
And the correct application of cupping is to place the initially empty cupping glass and to apply a moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses, but place them gently, and keep them briefly, allowing the humors to move to the area by drawing them in. And do not stop repeating this process and continue until you see the area reddened and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then you should scarify and repeat the suction slowly, and then consider the condition of the body.
For a person with delicate, easily injured skin, you should scarify them only once, to avoid the area becoming ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to amplify the scarification slightly and to moderate the suction gently.
And if the blood is thick, then you should scarify twice, for in the first instance, the path for the blood and its watery part to be refined is opened. But in the second, the scrutiny gained from removing the thick blood.
And if the blood is very impure, then a third scarification should be performed to achieve the desired result.
And finally, when we want to extract a small amount of blood gradually, one scarification is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify many times; and if we know the blood is thick, then deep scarification is necessary.
And the measure of scarification is the depth of the incision only.
And if the area where the incision is to be made is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, the sites for the cupping glasses should be treated with ointments that are softening, opening, and resolving.  If it is summer, then this would include oils like almond, violet, mild camomile, or poppy seed oil. But if it is winter, then use narcissus, lily, chamomile, or bloodroot oils, or similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth, balm, almond, or dill, and similar ones.
But if the area to be cupped has wide pores and tender flesh, then oil should be avoided.  Instead, the sites for the cupping glasses should be washed with cool water, water with leadwort, poppy water, or water with mullein, or similar preparations.
And if the person's blood is moist and watery, wash their cupping sites with sour wine, or water with myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
And for those with thick superfluities, wash the cupping sites with old wine, or water with yarrow (which is majorana), or a decoction of dill, or chamomile, or similar preparations.
And cupping should be avoided before a bath; if given, it should be administered shortly after the bath, within an hour or two, and the person should rest after cupping.
What is it that should be regulated in the case of cupping or bloodletting before the cupping?
You should consider at the beginning:  If the person being cupped or bled is choleric and has hot, inflamed blood, then they should take cooling things, such as milky salads, endive in sour wine, lettuce, seakale, juleps, and the like.
And give them foods like boiled greens, small birds' meats, and seasoned foods with acids, and similar things.
And for someone with a cold constitution, they should drink almond syrup, or syrup from sea-kale seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine (somewhat between old and new wine); and they should be told to consume little food and drink, and give them foods like greens, hemp seeds, small birds, and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more plentiful than the food.
And it is necessary to give certain people, at certain times,  "tyriaca alpharac," or musk-containing remedies, or aloe vera before cupping or bloodletting, or soon after, so that the main members are strengthened and the blood is refined; and they should not take these warmed up.
But the cupping that is without incision should be cupping placed on the liver, spleen, gout, and on the navel, on the knee areas, and on the groin area, for these parts do not tolerate incision on them.
And that is not sought for except for drawing blood from the affected area, like placing a cupping vessel on the breast in a blood-flowing illness of the nasal passages; and we use it so that cold, sticky airiness is dissolved from the affected body part, like placing one on the belly and navel, because this refines the affected body part, warms it, and relieves the pain by dissolving the airiness.
And it is placed on the sinuses when there is blockage or phlegm in them, because through the power of strong suction it quickly clears the blockage and eradicates the phlegm from its location.
And similarly, it does the same when placed on the liver and spleen, to remove the airiness that is trapped there.
And these cupping vessels are administered empty, only with suction; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping vessel is full and larger; it is either just hot water or water in which herbs appropriate for this purpose have been boiled.
The form of a cupping vessel administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have shaped it; and the quantity of the hollow be half a palm; and it should be on its side, in the area of the curve, halfway, the hole should be small, such that a needle can just enter it.
Let it be made of red leather or citrus, with thick margins,  leather, or similar materials, so that it does not move the limb from its position over it.
And there should be a transverse rod of leather or iron in the middle, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And this cupping vessel should be larger than the one we have described; and the small one smaller than that, depending on the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping vessels for children and the weakened are different from those for young people and those with large bodies.
And the way to place this cupping vessel with fire on the limb is to heat the surface with fire from wood, properly using a small beeswax candle, and placing that in the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping vessel.  This is so the fire is kindled around the area below, ensuring the patient's body is not burned.
And then it is placed on the patient's limb, and the finger is placed on the opening we mentioned, until, when we have applied the cupping vessels and do not want the finger to be exposed and the vapor to escape through that opening, the cupping vessel is immediately closed.
And, afterwards, heat the surface according to its method, and repeat it if needed.
But a cupping vessel that is used in a pleural illness, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or opening, and is only applied filled with water, and placed directly on the limb.
And this is its form: and the larger this cupping vessel is, the better it is, because it can receive a larger quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not applied to many limbs, but to those where cupping is not possible due to their small size, such as the foot and the gums and similar parts; or to limbs lacking flesh, such as the finger and the nose and similar parts.
And the quality of using those leeches should be found in clear, fresh, spring water.
And they should be left in fresh water day and night until they are hungry, and no cause of fullness remains in their belly; and then the body should be emptied first with bloodletting and cupping; and then the patient's limb should be rubbed until it is reddened; and then the leeches should be placed upon it.
And when they are full and drop off.
And if suction from the area is possible with a cupping glass, it is better for the healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with clean water; and rub and squeeze it.
And if the body of blood extends near the biting place of the leeches, and it is oozing, then you immerse a cloth in cold water, and place that over it until the oozing is stopped.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle powdered vitriol, or other similar astringent substances, on it, until the blood is stopped; or place roasted chickpea husks on the area, and leave them until the husks adhere to the area, and the blood is stopped.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, when possible to change them.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being applied, then rub the area with fresh blood, or prick the area with a needle until blood flows; and then apply them, for they quickly adhere when they sense blood.
And when you want them to drop off, sprinkle a little powdered alum, or salt, or ash, on them, and they will fall off quickly.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish physicians and the vulgar, and those who have never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a letter from them, boast of this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of the learned here in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at all; and I have not adopted this that I have learned, except through the length of reading the books of the ancients and study on understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And I will now turn to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have now described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experience has passed; since I have shortened this for you and freed it from lengthy explanations, and condensed it at the end of the condensation; and shown it at the end of the declaration; and formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as is done by the addition of explanation, just as I have done in the two previous chapters.
First Chapter.
A summary and collection of the essential aspects of bone fractures, those prerequisites needed before we begin discussing the repair of fractured and dislocated limbs of all kinds. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with a summary of the subject matter; and the chapters, the understanding of which is necessary for the craftsman and the standing upon the truth of those; that is, you and those who are ready to learn or acquire this noble art alongside you.
And so I say that when you encounter a fracture, dislocation, twist, or injury, then you must initially apply bloodletting or leeching, or both, if no other reason prohibits it, such as a weakness in their constitution, or if the person injured is a child, or an elderly person in decline, or if it is a time of extreme heat or extreme cold.
And afterwards, let their diet consist of cool herbs and the flesh of fowl and rabbits; and avoid heavy meats and filling foods, and any food that causes the veins to swell with blood, until you are certain of a controlled, hot abscess, and unless you fear the efflux of matter to the limb.
And then restore the patient to their original regimen, which is the one they were accustomed to.
And so, once the broken bone begins to be restored, the patient must eat nutritious foods that are nourishing, thick, and substantial, such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, rice, bread, peas, cow's stomachs, eggs, fresh fish, and thick wine and similar things.  With this regimen, the fracture's coagulation will happen more easily and better.
And know that broken bones in people who are in their prime and in the elderly, are not likely to be completely joined and healed naturally because of the wasting of their limbs.
However, nature joins and connects to the broken bone from all sides a certain glue-like substance that is thickened, which adheres and firmly holds it until it is completely joined and bound together, until it reaches a state of strength and firmness, just as a fire at the beginning until nothing obstructs its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient eat foods that are heavy, viscous, and substantial, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly all other limbs are different from each other.
And I come with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is diverse types of fractures within themselves.  (Or:  A variety of fractures exist within each type.) And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for there is a bow-shaped fracture, and others that occur in star-like patterns; and sometimes a fracture occurs along the bone's length: and these are fractures of the bone's surface and edges and additional [fractures] proceeding and not proceeding [from the main fracture], just as in a quill pen when it is prepared for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for each type [of fracture], there is a specific treatment or remedy in restoring it, according to the separate mention of it in its place.
A variety/different sign of a bone fracture. And by this is a bone fracture known: it is its twisting, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and this is when you press upon it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting at the affected spot, and it is not painful to the touch when you press on the bone with agitation, and the patient does not experience significant pain, then there is no fracture.
However, it is possible that there is a twisting or a small fissure, so you should not examine it with your hand and compression, but instead, place on it the medicinal remedies for which you remember the one suitable for the time; and then be strict with a subtle constriction.
And understand that when the site is bent but not cleft in two or otherwise dislocated, as if a whole part of its alignment is off, then you must begin immediately to rectify it, lest a suppurating boil occur there.
And if a suppurating boil does occur there, then leave it for some days until the boil subsides; and then bandage it according to every method you can of lightness and ingenuity.
And understand that the restoration and straightening of a displaced part is easier than that of a fractured bone.
And then strengthen it according to the remembrance of how to do it.
But if the bone is dislocated, then extension of the fractured limb (whether hand or foot) is necessary; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with one rope and your hand.
And maintain the position in which you place the limb in a bandage according to its natural shape, while the parts of the fractured limb are extended, then exert yourself to return those additions with ingenuity and according to every method you can to their places.
And be careful, according to your strength, that you do not cause pain or injury to the patient through your operation; and try to the best of your ability to apply one bone to its companion, according to their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you carefully touch it with your hand, and if you find any other cause, correct it and make it whole with the strength you possess.
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as some foolish physicians often cause abscesses or contractions in the limb through their operations, as we have seen in their many operations.
And the proper degree of immobilization of the calmed limb is what I recommend; so you should know that broken limbs vary in their size, and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and the like, the wrapping should be of fine, soft cloth.
But those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, require a firm, strong wrapping, for a firm bandage connects the large limb and binds it tightly everywhere, so that nothing penetrates it.
And then, carefully, apply a suitable bandage to the site of the fracture, using three or four layers of bandage, depending on the limb's needs.  Press your hand slightly against the bandage.
And now move towards the most superior part of the fracture site, and tighten the bandage less than you did initially when you tightened the fracture site. And then gently extend the bandage around the fracture site a little, gradually loosening the tightness until you have moved a considerable portion of the limb.
And now take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site, carefully.  Then move the bandages towards the lowest part of the fracture; and let your action involve the tightness of the wrapping and the gradual loosening of it, according to what we have described in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the bandage layers a linen or cloth pad to cover any twisting of the fracture, if there is any twisting; otherwise, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over these carefully made layers immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area.  If there is, apply something to reduce the abscess and inflammation. Leave it for a few days and then tighten the layers.
Let the splints be made of half of a sturdy, properly shaped branch, or from pinewood, or palm ribs; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others, and its length should match the limb's size; then, wrap the splints with another bandage, tightening as in your first wrapping; then tie it firmly on top, as we described about tightness, and make sure that your tightening is more directly over the fracture site, and the further away from the fracture, the looser the wrapping.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fine, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen some fools do in their operations, using ropes or twisted cordage, that is a major mistake, as it disrupts the even tightening.
Similarly, excessively fine threads are not suitable, for you will not be able to achieve the desired tightening with them.  And there should be at least one finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is irritated by the ends of the splints near the tightening in sensitive areas, then place some soft linen or carded wool underneath them to prevent injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption of the bone occurs. I will address this in the second chapter, discussing its uniqueness.
And know that not every broken limb should be splinted on the first day; this is because, when the limb is large, you should not place splints on it until approximately five, seven, or more days, depending on your assessment of the risk of a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters with which the Ancients restored fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A method of a common plaster for fracture repair, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it does not cause heat or cold:  take pulverized flour, specifically the medulla of the flour that settles on the walls of the mill after grinding.
And mix it as it is, but sift it with egg white, and make a mixture that is neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: a recipe of asafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and wild carrot root (migrach), of each a handful; of myrrh and aloes, a handful each; of aloes, two handfuls;  all ground and sifted, mixed with warm water or egg white if the patient's complexion is hot. Then use this plaster, as it is a good composition and restores slightly broken bones, and is beneficial for many people.
Another method of plaster, beneficial for fractures and sprains: a recipe of wild carrot root (migrach) and white marshmallow root (met de altea blanca), a handful each; of myrrh and aloes, half a handful each; of acacia, a little more than half a handful; of Armenian bole, two handfuls.
All are ground in a mortar with great care, and sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and for pain, fissures, and fractures: take a piece of linen cloth, soak it in sour wine and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but is useful for a hot abscess and expels pain effectively.
Another method of plaster to restore a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; grind them together and make a plaster from them.
A quicker method of plaster, useful for the restoration of a fractured bone and when you want resolution of remaining abscesses: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and the flour of yarrow, and mix them thoroughly. Grind them all together and mix them with wine, if the affected limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then you mix it with damp coriander water or with water and use it.
Another, stronger plaster for resolving a hard abscess, to aid in the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow, seeds of lily, and balm, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, and mix them together thoroughly. All must be ground up and mixed with willow water, or plain water, or wine, depending on the limb's condition and color.
However, Hippocrates in his book did not say that a plaster should be placed on a broken limb for its restoration, but rather a cerot (plaster) made of wax and oil, and nothing else; and he recommended that it be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is observed that such plasters are placed on a broken limb to aid in its restoration, and the ingredients in which there is drying with a small amount of warmth, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar substances to those we have mentioned.
A plaster for injuries and pain: take equal parts of figs, human skin (or bird skin), marshmallow, and salt; grind them, sieve them, and mix them to form a plaster.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain in place, and when it should be removed, depends on whether there is no pain, inflammation, or the bone is not displaced from its position, then it should not be loosened for a few days. And if there is severe pain, inflammation, or swelling at the location, then you should remove or loosen it immediately, and remove the plaster from it.
And take a linen cloth and a dampened sponge of the sea-lion, and submerge it in lukewarm water, and with that wash the affected area until the inflammation ceases and the pain subsides; then allow the limb to rest for an hour; and then place a layer of wool dipped in sour wine and oil or rubbed oil upon it, and bandage it for a night, until you are certain of any abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb is reduced and the pain from it is removed.
And then repeat that fine compression and small plaster, and do not tighten it with your initial constriction, and continue with it until it is healed.
And if the abscess, stiffness, pain, inflammation, and all the other symptoms have completely disappeared, and you no longer need the plaster and compression, then you repeat it just as you did at the beginning.
And if no cause of those we have mentioned afflicts the limb, then do not loosen it for only three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes all of this is left for twenty days, depending on how the limb responds to the loosening, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh coagulates around it.
Then increase the compression more than in your initial compression, and increase the patient's nourishment, in accordance with the patient's recovery.
But if you find the fracture site is already drying out and weakening more than it should, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.  Therefore, moisten it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it.  This should be done every three days, and loosen the compression slightly.  Through this procedure, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
However, what foolish restorers of limb fractures do another time, when it hasn't been properly restored at first, and is restored in a crooked way, is an error according to their procedure and a great danger.  If this were right, the ancients in their books would have magnified it and would have acted accordingly.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, which makes it more reasonable that one should not do it.
Second Chapter: Of fractures when occurring to the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a blunt object, and the blow crushes all the bone inwards to the skull, as happens to a wooden post.  This type is therefore called a comminuted fracture; or the blunt object cuts a part of the bone and cuts into the flesh but does not pass through to the back of the bone; and this type of fracture is called a simple fracture.
And the severity of these two types of fractures can be significant or minor;  and a fracture that is a crushing or grinding type is caused by a blow with a rock or a fall on a stone, and similar impacts.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone.  The severity of these two types of fractures can be significant or minor.
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the subtlety of a small hair, and therefore this type is called a hairline fracture.
And a fracture is caused either by a fall or a blow from a rock, or similar impacts, that forces a piece of the bone inward. This happens in a concave location, just as the ribs are affected when struck and they are fractured inward.
This is more common in the bones of the young, as is often seen in the heads of children.
And in all these types of fractures, the bone fragments are scattered, like separated stars. And I will proceed with the repositioning of everything to its proper place.
And we diagnose all these types of fractures by examination of them, and by investigation using probes and examining the decaying flesh on top of them.
A specific type of fracture is recognized by the fact that it is exposed on the bone, and it is cleaned and examined with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms, and if you observe symptoms that indicate a serious condition, such as vomiting, restlessness, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, swelling and stiffness of the limbs, and similar severe symptoms, without a doubt, it is not going to be successfully treated.
And if you observe symptoms that are not severe, you hope for recovery, then you begin the treatment of the patient.
The reason for this is that if the afflicted person comes to you at the beginning of the affliction, and this is during the winter days, then you should study the condition of the bone before the 14th day according to all aspects of the situation.
And if it is during the summer days, then you should attempt to set the bone before the 7th day, before the area beneath the bone becomes corrupted by inflammation, and the symptoms we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the inflammation covering the brain, and it is with broken and rubbed pieces, then you must cut out the broken and rubbed pieces, as I will describe to you.
And you should carefully shave the head of the afflicted patient, and expose the bone according to the customary and suitable method, as closely as possible to the nature of the affliction, and with gentleness toward the patient.
And if you find a bone exposure, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary.  Fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rubbed oil, and allow the affliction to rest until the abscess subsides and the blood flow stops; then begin with the encirclement of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a straight-edged scalpel, and this is its form:  And then administer another scalpel, slightly wider than the first; and this is its form:
And then administer a scalpel wider still than the second.
And it is necessary for you to have several different scalpels, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, with sharpened edges on their ends, and made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease in striking on the scalpel, so that you do not strike the head and damage it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to bore around it before you use the scalpels with the drills, which are called non-deepening drills.
And they are not named thus except because they do not reach the surface of the bone near it, for the drill has a rounded end or edge, and one that is below the sharp head, like a small edge or circle, that prevents it from sinking into and passing the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each appropriate to the thickness of each bone, so that you have on hand for each skull a drill whose end is sharp, and whose length and shortness corresponds to the thickness of the skull.
And this is the way for three types of drills:  To drill around a fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then change the drill to another location and place the appropriate amount between each hole, equivalent to the thickness of the ray or approximately that.
Then cut with scalpels what is between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible, as we said, until you have removed the bone, either with your hand, or with some other tool, such as pliers and delicate forceps.
And you must take great care that the scalpel does not touch anything of the spinal cord.
And therefore, once you have drilled around the bone, and if it is connected to the spinal cord, you must separate it, and extract it.  You must scrape and smooth the rough edges of where the bone was connected to the spinal cord using a similar tool to a scalpel, but one that is more pointed and delicate.
And if any small pieces of bone remain and are loose, then carefully remove them with the tools available to you; then treat the wound with liniments and ointments, as we have described.
And another method of operation is gentle, free from fear, which Gualdo praised greatly; and this is his teaching:  It is necessary for you, at the beginning, to begin by uncovering the area of the bone where the fracture is most severe and apparent, until you have uncovered that area and placed the tip of this gentle and pleasant scalpel, whose form is this:
And the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part has two sides extending lengthwise, just like a blade; so that the lenticular part lies against the spinal cord with the sharp side of the blade cutting into the bone.
Then strike the scalpel on a part with a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone with ease as it is loosened, and you are certain that no accident occurs, so as to avoid any feared event.  And if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of their craft; truly, even if they were sleeping.
Then if any piece remains attached to the bone in any part of the bone, cut it off with the lenticular end of the scalpel, and remove it easily, for it is detached without harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the tissue, and whatever is cut off or removed from the bone is its surface, and there remain roughnesses and subtle irregularities, then it is necessary to scrape off those roughnesses and eradicate those irregularities with delicate razors, for which you have prepared a variety of sizes so that you can apply the most appropriate ones in every location and the most direct ones according to where you are in your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that in your procedure, with which you scrape the bone initially, you use the widest of those razors, and then use the more delicate ones, and do not cease doing this continuously until you have reached the finest and most delicate of all of them.
However, for each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, you must apply treatment according to what you see as needed for its repair.
And this is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And what we have written about this is demonstrated in great fractures.
And if the skin is retracted when you expose the bone, then you must take a cloth according to the size of the wound, and soak it in warmed oil, and place it over the wound opening; and then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in warmed wine and oil, and place that over the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible so you do not cause further injury; and then apply a wide bandage, and do not tie it too tightly, but only enough to hold the wound together.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two, until you are sure there is no further inflammation; then, remove it, and apply medicines to counteract dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour, ashes, and similar powders.
And you should make powder from these medicines, ground into a powder, and apply it to the wound, as they are dry; and in general, use any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to sting.
And be careful, according to your skill, that the wound remains clean during your treatment; and do not allow any suppuration or other foulness to accumulate there; for when such things gather on the skin covering the brain, they corrupt it and cause harm, and this will lead to severe illness.
And harm comes to the skull, especially when the bone is exposed, and particularly when the treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on the surface of the wound; and if you see these harmful symptoms in the patient, know that it is dangerous without a doubt.
And if the blackness is not from the wound itself, but from the medicine applied, and if the medicine is causing this blackness, then you should take one part honey and three parts of olive oil, and with this, moisten a cloth, and place it on the skull; and then treat it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in two parts simultaneously, but sometimes in one part, because there are two bones in the nose; for the lower part is cartilaginous, and is not broken, and there is only friction, twisting and bending to it.
However, if one of the two parts of the nose is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nose and use your index finger to push that fracture inward, and your thumb outward, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this with ease, and be careful not to cause the patient pain through your actions.
And if the fracture is in the most prominent part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be set with the tip of a tool that is slightly thickened.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you should do the same.
And strive for the patient's restoration on the first day after the fracture, if possible; and if not, then approximately seven or ten days later, apply a soothing poultice.
And approximately insert a piece of linen cloth into the nostril, if the fracture is in one part, or two pieces, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the thickness of the cloth fill the nasal opening.
Some ancient healers advised that the cloths be soaked in broth and changed daily, but I do not find this appropriate.  Instead, the cloth should be soaked in a mixture of beaten egg white and powdered spice; and leave it in place until the bone has set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a cloth, a bird's feather, wrapped in linen, is inserted into the nose;  this is done when the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not forbidden from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; if you wish, do this, or if you wish, use cloths.
And if, on another occasion, a purulent abscess forms, plaster the nose with a cerot or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil, or with diachylon.
But if no purulent abscess forms, then you should cover the outside with sesame flour and powdered cumin mixed with egg white;  then place a linen bandage over that, and do not bind the nose with anything else.
But if the bones of the nose are fractured or broken into small pieces, then you should cut around them, and remove those pieces with instruments appropriate for that; then close the fracture and heal it with things that promote fleshing and consolidation, and with suitable plasters.
And if an ulcer occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with cloths and administer lead cannulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by an ulcer, then observe if the fracture is only superficial, and not broken in two but bent inward, then its reduction is easy.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of your right hand; and push with that the prominence of the fracture inwards with ease towards the outside, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; with that gently align it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension of both parts according to the straight line until its possible alignment.
And if you encounter a loosening or displacement of teeth, then bind those that you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; and then place a compress on the broken jaw, and then place over that a folded cloth, and then place over the cloth a large, properly made poultice, or a piece of lead of the same length as the jaw; and then bandage that accordingly, as your method of bandaging is prepared and the application is appropriate, until it is not destroyed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and to consume nourishing, light foods.
And if you estimate that the shape has already been altered in any way, then you should carefully remove and loosen it on the third day; and then correct what has been altered on it and plaster it with powdered chalk, with egg white, or with flour of figs, after you have removed the compress from it, and place a soft wool bandage over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and fitted to it, and the bone's position is not altered, leave it; do not remove it until it is healed and the fracture is set; for many times this fracture is set in three weeks.
And if, another time, a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often said about its treatment until it is healed and the abscess is resolved.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider whether it is a piece of bone separated or splinters; then you should carefully remove those splinters with what is appropriate for their removal from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should enlarge it with leeches according to your needs.
And after you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, place one of the appropriate plasters on it and encourage the healing, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when fractured.
Often the collarbone is broken on the part towards the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
For it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts, apart from any splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it happens with splinters, and is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is with an open wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without an open wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the injured and fractured collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
And then manipulate the fracture with your fingers until it is in proper shape, and is neither raised excessively nor concave.
And if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, and its size according to your needs; and extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until you have aligned the fracture correctly.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone's extremity outward, because it has become jammed, then the patient must be placed supine on their back, and place a cushion of medium size on the muscle above their neck.
And the assistant presses the muscle below until the collarbone's bone is lifted out of the jam, and then you straighten the fracture and manipulate it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters or sharp pieces of the collarbone, then it is necessary to cut them and remove those splinters easily.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then you make an incision with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, having placed under the collarbone the instrument that serves as a lever; and it is an instrument of wood or iron of this shape:
And it is similar to a scoop, of which this is the concave part; and let its width be according to your needs, depending on the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as much as possible for the operation; it should have two ends like a wedge, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the gap of the wound you have made when extracting the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure it is a feverish abscess, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the gap is small, or you fear a feverish abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's opening.
And if a feverish abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rubbed olive oil and wine, and place it over it.
And take care that the bandage does not move from over the broken bone.  Therefore, you should see the patient each day, and when you see that the ligament is softened or the bandage has moved, then you should adjust it and tighten the binding.
Then place the patient's sleep, the sleep of the patient, on the patient's neck, and place a small cushion under the patient's armpit in the sleep of the patient during the night; so that with that the patient's injury is raised from the side of it, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is raised to the level of the muscle; or the patient's arm is bound to the patient's neck.
And do not loosen the bandage if there is not swelling or abscess in the area, for up to twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the patient's skin reacting to it, and adjust the binding and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and coagulated.
And it is tightened and comforted according to the month in 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a fractured shoulder.
The shoulder blade is fractured at a point lateral to the patient and not fractured through, only the edges.
And therefore, when the fracture is located there—and is fractured in the middle of it—and is only known by touch, then, according to the shape of the fracture, you must prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape in every way possible.
Then place on the area powdered myrrh with white of egg and stop the bleeding; then place a folded cloth pad; then place a thin, wooden splint over it, matching the size of the entire shoulder blade, or a little more.
But if below the splint there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that hollow with styptic, and then adjust the splint to make it even.
And then tie it tightly above with a long bandage, with appropriate constriction and firmness to the splint, until it is no longer displaced from its place.
And check the bandage each day; and every time it is softened, bandage it again and tighten it, and reposition the splint if it is displaced from its place.
And let the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade will be restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And therefore when this number of days is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and you should know for certain that the union of the bones is not threatened nor is their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the location of the heavy bone and place the splint beneath it, then you cut above it, remove it, and do as we said regarding the fracture of the clavicle's healing from abscesses if an abscess arises here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot sometimes breaks in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much more slowly, being crushed and splintered.
And among the complications when the middle of the foot is broken, there is a sinking of the parts inward, causing great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, severe fever, and vomiting blood; and the broken bone's cavity is apparent and not hidden from feeling.
And the restoration of it involves placing the patient on their back, and placing a cushion between their shoulders; then press on their muscles and adjust their sides with the hands of two assistants, and be subtle in the procedure and in aligning everything according to all possible means and necessities, until the bone's shape returns to its proper form.
And then apply a poultice and bandages, and place a thin splint of willow or reed, or similar lightweight material, then wrap it in cloth; and then be subtle in binding that around the broken bone so that it does not move; and proceed with wrapping in a circular manner around the back sometimes, and tighten it decently; and then continually monitor the bandage, and when softened, tighten it further.
And if necessity arises due to loosening, corrosion, swelling, pain, or abscess that develops in the area, then you loosen and remove it, remove the poultice, and correct what has happened through the method of treatment; and then reapply the poultice, if needed, to the area; and maintain the bandage until healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of the ribs when fractured.
Know that a fracture of the ribs occurs only in the thick parts, which are on the back; and in the extremities and front portions, they do not suffer damage of this kind, because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense, through examination with the fingers.
And the restoration should be such that the fracture is aligned with the fingers in the best possible way, until it is aligned as necessary, and then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if it is needed.
And if the rib fracture is leaning towards the internal parts, then the patient experiences severe pain and stabbing pain, just like the stabbing pain that afflicts those with pleurisy, and because of this, the bone pierces the lining; and there is difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting of blood; and this is a difficult condition to cure.
And the ancients were ingenious in dealing with that with many inventions.
And from their teachings, it is said: you must restrict the patient's food that engenders inflation and windiness, so that the belly is inflated and stretched, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
However, we would avoid this, because it is not a light cause to generate a hot abscess if it does not occur; and if it has already occurred, then help is needed for that.
And some of them would say that a cupping glass should be placed over it and that it should be sucked with force; and it seems like a rational approach, however, it is feared that the cupping glass draws the superfluities to the location because of the weakness.
And some of them would say: the area must be covered with wool that has been soaked in warm oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is full, so that the dressing is tight when it envelops that according to its curvature; and then the patient should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through diet and medicine.
And if a violent cause afflicts the patient, whom it cannot withstand, and the bone pierces the membrane with a painful puncture, causing us concern about the patient, then we must open up the area, expose the broken rib, and then place an instrument on top that keeps the structure in place, the method of which is established beforehand, and cut the bone with ease and extract it.
And then we must stitch the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if there is an abscess inside, then you take and mix powders in rubbed oil and apply it to the area, and let the patient be treated with what is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Sometimes there are fractures in the bones of the neck, and sometimes there is damage to their articulation, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if you find their muscles already softened, numb, dead, and you cannot move them, stretch them or squeeze them, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle, they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed, and in such a state of disrepair it is fatal.
And if you move them and feel a constriction with your fingers and pricking, then know that the bone's integrity is intact and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar signs in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then, if you see that the feet are also softened, like the muscles, and when they lie on their back, they experience involuntary movements and spasms, and sometimes they lie on their back wanting to urinate but cannot, then know that this is fatal, and do not try to treat them.
But if you don't observe any of those symptoms, the cause is better and less severe.
And the treatment for this is to apply a soothing poultice made from heated oil or crushed egg yolks to the affected vertebra.  Apply this for several days, until the inflamed area is soothed.
Then apply a comforting and stimulating plaster, and bandage it securely.  Instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not to sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you observe signs of bone fracture or any other cause that separates the bone from its surrounding tissue, then you must cut away the surrounding flesh and remove the bone.  Then rejoin the two edges of the wound with stitches, if the gap is large, and treat the area with a healing ointment until it heals.
But if the back of the bone is fractured, and it is the end of the process, then you must insert the tip of your left hand into the rectum, and hold the fractured bone in place with your other hand as best you can to align it properly. Then apply a plaster and bandage, if necessary, and secure them firmly.
And if you find fractured bones there, then remove them and treat the wound with the previous methods until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the [broken] jaw.
The bones of the jaw are often fractured, and when they are, the fracture is usually only a separation of the ends, and they are jagged along their length, and they shift away from each other.  The patient experiences pain and tenderness in the area, and the limb is numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it so that it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at one end, then you align that end so that it is matched to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is along the length or has already shifted, then you have the patient lie on their stomach until you are ready to restore that fracture. And so, when you have aligned it, place a poultice over it, and then place a splint of wood or something similar over it, and tightly secure it so that you don't worry about any further fracture or movement of the splint.
And align the cavity with whatever fills it until it reaches a tight fit, and tell the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a painful abscess develops, then you stop the extension and restoration until the painful abscess is calmed, and apply what calms it, as was previously stated; then return to the restoration, and secure it properly.
And if the bones are shattered or splintered, then you must set them.
Chapter 11.
Of the restoration of a fractured bone.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder's head.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness according to this method:
And two ligaments are tied to the two extremities, and then it is suspended from a raised position.
And place the patient on a bed; then gently lay the patient's broken arm on the wood until the joint of the arm (the point where the arm bends) is aligned with the middle point where the curve of the wood is.
And then suspend some heavy object over it, or the attendant extends the wood below; and then the physician holds the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
The other method is that the patient is placed on their back and the hand at the neck is supported by a bandage; and then command two attendants, one to hold what is above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold what is below it; and each of them should extend it to their side.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tighten the bandage over the fracture and another bandage over that, and each of the two attendants should extend it to their sides.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed over the joint and the other below the fracture, towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary to place the bandage over that area and over the elbow.
Apply that with ease and without trouble, and then, when it is properly aligned and applied with good application, tighten it if no suppurating boil occurs.
But if a suppurating boil occurs, then leave the tightening until the seventh day, and place on it wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil until the boil subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a bandage of clean cloth over the plaster; then adjust the arm on that support, and place their open hand on their muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm on the support so that the arm is in the proper position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And you place on the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the others; and place the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the break, with an additional three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the constriction, which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your constriction over the fracture site is tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the constriction should be.
And thus, adjust the placement of the splints and the constriction as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position; then you do [the procedure].
And if you fear a suppurative abscess, then leave the constriction and splints on for seven days, as we have said.
Then consider the ligaments in all parts for three days, so that no swelling or inflammation occurs in the area; or food should be withheld from the limb due to the excess of constriction; and then correct everything according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that no cause for this will occur, then do not loosen the binding until approximately three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands on their stomach.
And place a poultice of full wool on the aid, and be careful at all times of night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted, or that the ligament is not softened; then correct this all with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we previously mentioned, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until the swelling has begun to subside; and then it is necessary to increase the amount of food.
Because it is customary for the poultice and the limb to be swollen for 40 days; and then it is necessary to loosen them and administer baths and medicate with ointments that correct it.
And if the fracture is badly afflicted, then you do not loosen the ligament and splints until after several days or even two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called two "foci"; of which one is small, and it is that which supports the said finger, and the other is large and is the one that lies beneath the small finger, on the lower side.
And frequently only the larger "focus" is broken, or the smaller one, and frequently both are broken together.
And when the small "focus" is fractured above, then the restoration of it is easier, and its healing is more straightforward.
And when the "focus" of it is fractured below, the fracture's repair is difficult, and its healing is challenging.
And even more difficult than that is when both bones are fractured together.
Therefore, if the fractured bone is the small "focus" above, then it is appropriate for the physician, during the restoration, to apply a small amount of extension with ease until it is united.
But if the large "focus" is fractured, then it requires a more forceful extension.
And if both "foci" are fractured together, then you must apply the constriction much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the shape of a hand during the restoration and the extension, laid out on a cushion, with the wrist of the hand higher than all the other fingers, and the thumb lower than the other fingers, and the patient be seated on a smooth, hard surface.
And place a cushion in front of him, at his height or level, so that the patient does not experience strain.
And then one attendant extends the lower arm with their hand or bandage, and another attendant extends the upper arm similarly.
And then the physician manipulates the bone until it returns to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are irregularities, then you must use all your skill to reposition each piece in its proper place.
And if there appears a separate irregularity that punctures the skin and you are not hopeful of restoring it, then you must operate on it and remove it according to the method previously described.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter about this, and therefore follow the treatment of that.
And if you encounter a boil at the start of your treatment, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of rosemary oil and white wax, and it should be between specifically delicate and subtle, and tightly bandage the cloth over that until the boil subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a preparation of ground powder mixed with egg white, and then place plasters; and let the plaster placed over the fracture be the most suitable and strongest.
And know that the types of plasters for the arm are found in the most important arrangements, meaning fractures in one or two compartments at once.
And then apply your bandage to the fracture site more strongly and vigorously, and if the bandage is placed on the upper parts of the fracture or on its lower parts, apply the bandage a little more gently, according to what was previously described in the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, and not hard or rough, and the bandage should be of a medium tightness, neither too loose nor too tight, just as we have previously described.
And observe the limb and its ligament for a few days. And if any cause requiring correction arises, such as swelling on the limb, then you should immerse the limb in warm water until the swelling subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the constriction has softened and the bone has rejoined and looks normal, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive constriction, for then you must soften that slightly and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then bind it firmly again.
But if the patient does not exhibit any of the conditions we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be removed for approximately 20 days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's arm should be suspended by its own power of active movement, and have them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or a very mild one is restored in 28 days, and all of this is according to the disposition of the complexions and the disposition of the healing power.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fractures of the hand's wrist and fingers.
Know that the wrist of the hand and the joints of the fingers are often fractured, and they are injured not only by impact but also by repeated rubbing.
And when the hand is injured by fracture or rubbing, then the patient must be laid down flat and a bandage placed on it evenly, and then the patient's hand should be placed on that bandaged area.
And then the attendant extends the broken bones and the physician binds them together until they are properly joined.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, lest there be a suppuration; and then place a splint over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, then make something like a ball of cloth, and order the patient to hold it with their fractured palm; then it should be bandaged with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather covered with cloth, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and bandage it as necessary.
However, if the fracture is in the outer parts, then you must place a splint on top and another splint underneath on the palm of the hand, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the bandage, just as the hand is wrapped around the thumb with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs to any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be splinted as necessary, and then bandaged with the palm; and if desired, place a small, straight splint on it, so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, ring finger, or pinky finger, then it should be splinted and bound with the adjacent finger; or all fingers should be bound together, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and then that, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose it—with your operation—with what is necessary when any such cause occurs, according to how it is iterated in the narration.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken, and it is recognized by its movement being shifted forward and to its most prominent part.
And the restoration of it is done so that the ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament under the fracture, and the patient is laid prone on their stomach and on their face.
And then the attendant stretches all the ligament to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be close to the knee, in the direction of the hip socket, so that the stretching pushes against it, and the other ligament under the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is close to the knee, then the ligament should be placed close to the knee, and the stretching should be done in the parts below.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both his hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is properly joined; then it is necessary to apply a poultice and a bandage, lest the affected limb becomes infected. But if it becomes infected, then you must leave it for several days until the acute inflammation subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this: it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, fold it two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, in the lower parts, and let the ends of the splint extend from the most superior part of both areas. Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and the thigh.
And then place splints on the thigh over the fractured area, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the gaps between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is secured.
And then begin with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture area, using three or four wraps.  As you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, it should become progressively lighter, softer, and looser.
Then extend the two ends of the splint to the lower parts until they reach the ankle of the foot, and firmly hold both ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not shift from its position.
And then leave the bandage on it, ensuring that no corrosion, boil, inflammation, or similar problems occur on the limb; and if any of these conditions arise, then remove it gently, and correct whatever has happened immediately, as we have often said.
However, if there is a bone fragment lodged in the bone, then you should remove it as best as possible; and if not, cover it and leave it, and treat it with what preceded the reminder until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh or other parts are splinted, just as we have said for injuries to the arm.
However, in a restoration done in this manner, the patient does not experience limping; and if it is restored alone, or if the other leg is applied, then it is necessary that the patient limp with the affected leg.
And know that the thigh is splinted for 40 days, or a little more or a little less, and all this is according to the diversity of the constitutions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fractured kneecap/patella.
Know that a fractured kneecap/patella often heals, but it sometimes results in a lot of friction/abrasion.
But if it results in a fracture, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a plaque (a fragment), and on this, everything has been determined through sensation (examination).
And the restoration of it is thus, that which is broken in its parts is joined together by means/methods until it is joined and connected as much as possible by equalizing, facilitating, and working/manipulating.
And then apply a plaster and place it over that round patch, if you need that one; and bandage tightly with a bandage suitable for this.
And then consider all the methods we have described in other fractures, like an abscess and similar situations, in such a way that it opposes any accident with what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is thin, and is called the shin bone.
And the treatment for any of the types of fractures that affect the two bones of the arm, is done similarly to the restoration of the arm, and the procedure is the same.
And if both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is dislocated in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is dislocated forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it underneath, and it is for those reasons that are not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, reduction, and bandaging of the splints, accordingly.
However, if the fracture of the leg is extensive with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and you should alleviate it with your skill.
And if the leg requires some operation on the arm, and when you adjust the splints and complete all your operation, then you shall take pieces of light wood, which are placed below the supports that are placed on cushions, and are easily made of palm branches; choose those with a small thickness, and do not use any thick ones, and their length should correspond to the length of the leg, from the top down to the lowest part.
And then wrap it with cloth in two layers along its length, and place one layer over the affected part of the leg on one side and the other on the other side, and let them extend from the top down to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places, at both ends and in the middle, for with this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and is in a good position.
And now a small wooden support has been placed, corresponding to the length of the leg; and the leg is placed on it to prevent any movement.
And it is especially necessary that you do this in cases of fracture, and when it is properly a broken bone.
And from now on, examine the leg each day and study it further, and you should watch for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar conditions; and if any of these occur, then apply whatever is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the heel bone and bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the heel does not occur often; but in the bones of the foot, fractures occur sometimes; and in the toes of the foot, fractures rarely occur, and they are affected only by friction during the process of the body’s positioning.
And if the bones of the foot suffer a fracture and the bones are sometimes raised above each other, then the patient should place their foot on the ground prepared as if walking.
And then place one foot on what is elevated by those bones, and press down on those bones, and squeeze, and push them until they return to their place.
And then place a plaster and bandage over it, and place a small table under the sole of the foot with two flat ends.
And then secure that with a downward pressure of the foot, since you have wrapped it with bandages and other things as needed.
And after three or four days, then you loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones either reduced (put back in place), or broken or dislocated, and the procedure for these is as you know.
But if any fingers are broken, then restore them, and set them in place as I have and recounted to you in the restoration of fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and let it be slightly wider than the finger; and then place the previously described table under the foot, and secure it with downward pressure.
But if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its own size wrapped in linen, and secure the table on the bottom of the foot, and let it be placed on one end of the table over the front of the foot, so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is fitting for you not to forget that you must consider all the things that have been said to you in the other fractures and accidents which we have discussed; and be prepared for every accident with what is necessary.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the thigh bone, the hip bone, and the penis of the male.
When the thigh bone is broken, then make that incision in a curved fashion, and then slightly incline it towards the back, and let it be held behind.
Then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be done to the thigh in this way; then the woman should be calmed, and raise her back little by little, for all of that is done until the broken bone is back in place, and the broken bone is repositioned.
And then place pillows on her back, and when she wants to urinate the wool comes out easily, and she urinates, and you reduce and return it according to the manner in which you positioned it at the beginning, and then return it to its initial position.
And do this for seven days or so, for then it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and place a reed cannula over its opening; and insert the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated inside the thigh, for this will reposition the fracture.
And then it should be filled with wool and remain so for several days, as we have already stated, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and setting what we have described for the hip bone.
And what is correct is not hidden in these nearby and easily healed fractures, especially for those who study and use and understand this book of mine well; for this fracture signifies to you, in the most favorable conditions, the most direct path to its restoration and proper setting, so understand it well.
However, in the case of a broken penis in a man, take a bandage made of bird's feathers and place it over the penis; then, place a cloth wrapping over that; and let it remain wrapped for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of bones when affected by plague.
It is convenient for someone with a fractured bone affected by plague, especially if the bone is large like the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, to bleed them and lance the area as soon as the conditions for bleeding, as we have stated above, allow you to do so.
And if the plague is causing the blood to flow, then it is necessary that you apply a cauterization to the flow, using powdered crushed glass, if no other remedy is present.
And then proceed to restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this if an abscess does not develop.
But if a serious abscess develops, then you leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days, for you will cause harmful complications.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary that you carefully reposition it and hold it in place with your hands with ease and little force.
But if your hands are not prepared for the application of force and the reduction of the bone with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight inches and its width is according to the size of the injury; and therefore it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, depending on the amount needed for the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And it should be round, and of little thickness so that it is not bent by the pressure upon it during the operation.
And it should have a sharp tip at each end; and its top should be thick, tapering down to a point halfway from the ends.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", that is, a small spatula.
Therefore, its sharp end should be placed high on the prominent bone end.
And you push it in one motion until the bone returns, and it is secured with some binding.
Therefore, try to bring the fracture ends together, and if the broken bone end is thin and does not hold the instrument well, then you must cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grip it properly.
But if you cannot fully reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with whatever appropriate cutting instruments we have mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible.
And then scrape away any roughness or small splinters that remain on the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and shortly after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you deem best to greatly benefit the patient.
When your bone-setting is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and, especially if it is summer, do not put a poultice or anything oily on the wound, so that it does not cause suppuration and corruption.
And then administer styptics at the time of completing the bone setting, and leave the wound uncovered, so that you can cut the hole with scissors and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to press the wound against the fracture, for foolish doctors have often done this, causing death or a gnawing or spreading illness in their patients; that is, gangrene. And if your (treatment of) the fracture is light, soft, different from the treatment of other fractures.
If the wound is large or of poor quality, and you fear any of the bad outcomes we have described, and you find pain in the area, then you should not apply styptics there, but make a dressing of hard cloths instead of styptics and bind it tightly.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to suppurate, so that pus is generated in it, then you remove the cloth you had placed over it with wine, and then apply poultices, ointments with which it is customary to treat wounds, like tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
You should loosen the bandage and examine the wound each morning and evening until it is healed and closed, and the limb should be prepared in such a way that the pus drains from it to the lower parts with ease.
If many days pass and the wound is not healed or the pus has not drained from it, then know that there are complications present, so you should investigate the wound by probing it. And of those complications, those that are separable, remove and extract them; those that are not separable and cause pain in the limb, force you to cut them open, according to what is possible for you.
And if the wound has developed suppuration or festering, that is, inflammation, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply a remedy for that, appropriate to the healing of which a description precedes in its chapter.
And concerning this, which requires my instruction and your attention: when a large bone is broken, treat the limb in the same way as a broken thigh bone, or similar injuries to large limbs, and do not attempt to pull or extract it, as death frequently results from this.  Leave it undisturbed until it is able to heal, as it will often set itself within approximately 20 or 30 days.  Then treat the wound if you see fit, or leave it alone if not.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of swelling that occurs in the wake of any fracture.
Often this swelling occurs in the aftermath of a fracture's healing, especially near the joints, distorting the limb's shape and severely hindering the limb's natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent, and administer remedies that have astringent properties, such as alum, and vinegar, and myrrh, and ceruss, and similar substances.  Use some or all of these, mixing them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply this mixture to the swelling on a cloth, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage in place for several days without loosening it; then remove it and apply another, until the swelling subsides.  Or place a lead sheet gently over the area, for lead has the property of reducing inflammation in the limbs.
However, if the swelling has become hard and compacted, and removal is necessary, then carefully cut it in the highest part of the affected area, and remove the superfluous, prominent portion, or scrape it with some raspatory tool until it's gone.  Then treat the area until it heals.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural strength.
When a fractured bone is repaired, and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, this is due to various causes:  one is the excessive loosening or incorrect binding of the ligaments; or excessive tightness of the ligaments, hindering the nourishment reaching the limb; or excessive application of remedies; or improper movement at the wrong time; or insufficient blood flow to the body of the patient and their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to provide the patient with nourishment and make their body soft until the blood supply is restored; and administer baths; and introduce joy and cheerfulness to them.
And afterward apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water compresses, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and prevent the proper operation of their function.
When, after the limb has been repaired, improper healing leads to crookedness and prominence in the broken bone and swelling, and this disfigures the shape of the limb, but nevertheless the limb is not impeded from its natural function, then you should not accept the claim of anyone who believes the limb is newly broken.
But many foolish physicians and healers have done this in our land; and this practice is highly reprehensible, causing great fear, the sign of which is death.
However, if lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be soaked in lukewarm water in which softening herbs are boiled, such as elder leaves and their roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and an emollient plaster should be applied, such as well-prepared diachylon; or a mucilage of elder root should be made, mixed with goose fat or beeswax oil, and applied as a plaster; or fatty figs should be crushed with pigeon dung, and similar remedies known as consolidants.
And sometimes it is resolved with persistent gentle friction using damp hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in all directions at all times.
However, if the crookedness has already progressed, become strong, and has turned to stone, and requires treatment with iron, then the swelling on top must be cauterized and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which is superfluous from the swelling of the bone itself should be cut away using fine scalpels, and the process must be approached with care and diligence.
Chapter 23.
Of discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their proper place, preventing movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when an accident results in a dislocation, it is essential to quickly attempt its reduction, and delay should be avoided; for if delayed, the area becomes inflamed and hardened, making dislocation reduction difficult.
And for this reason, the patient should not be roughly handled or stretched during the inflammation, for often this causes spasms and prolonged pain.
But when this happens, you should apply leeches to the inflamed area of the patient, and leave them until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and it can be reduced more easily.
And any limb thus treated will be cured, and the displaced part will return to its proper place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, following the precedent set for fractures; from the highest part of the body down to the lowest.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the lower jaw.
So if the two jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation is in either of two manners:  either they are displaced slightly from their place and a little softened; or they are entirely and completely dislocated, to the point that they are softened in the joint area, that the patient is drooling and cannot hold their mouth closed, and their tongue is tied up.
However, when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns on its own with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then a gentle reduction must be administered, and must not be delayed at all.
And it is necessary for the attendant to hold the patient's head, and for the physician to place the finger of one hand into the area of the dislocated jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he place both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hand be outside, with which he applies pressure; and he instructs the patient to move their jaws and separate them on each side; and the physician moves the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And therefore, when they are returned and held in place, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over those powders a cloth with a cerate, and let it be made of beeswax and oiled; and then it should be bound lightly with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and let their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not tilt to either the right or the left side; and do not force them to chew on anything; let their food be soft, until the pains have subsided and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not trouble the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, and breathing, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often fever and profuse sweating occur, and the patient's abdomen is readily agitated, and there are easy vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and often the one who suffers this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated from within the chest because of its connection with the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is apparent to the touch.
And the restoration is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then compress the area with your palm with firm pressure, for it will return.
And then apply a poultice and powders to that area and press it.
But the extremity that joins the elbow and continues from it is not dislocated in any way; therefore, it must be reduced and held in place as we have said and as you have the equipment to do.
And then apply a poultice, powders, and bandages, and instruct the patient to adhere to quietude and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the reduction of muscle dislocation.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the top part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated on the upper part of the muscle, and this is done quickly; and it is not dislocated behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in front by the nerves.
And most often it is dislocated and comes out on the lower parts towards the top, and more so in those whose flesh is sparse, it is easily dislocated; but in those with much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And often, men suffer injury or blows, and the muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and is swollen because it is already dislocated.
Then you must try this until you are absolutely certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts towards the armpit, so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and, below the armpit, near the contact of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor can they move it in any way.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And a simple reduction of this dislocation is made when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction is that the healer raises the patient's hand upwards; and then places their hands below the patient's armpit, and raises the joint forcibly back into its place, and the healer raises the patient's hand and extends it upwards; and then places it back down so that it returns easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a long time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient should be bathed in hot water and a poultice administered that softens and smoothes, such as a mixture of the roots of marjoram, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and should be administered.
And then the patient should be placed on their back, and a wool pad should be placed under their armpit, that is neither too loose nor too tight; and then the physician places their heel on the pad, and lifts the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's arm so it is not pulled downwards, and another assistant holds the patient's head so it is not pulled downwards, so that it quickly returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: have a man present who is taller than the patient, and stand on the affected side, and place his arm under the patient's armpit and lift the armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's arm downwards from their stomach. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with them, so that it weighs them down, so that the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced in another way: a long, round-headed wooden post, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is placed under the patient;  then, thick cloths are placed over the top of the post, and the patient stands along the length of the post, and their arm is extended downwards on the other side; and the patient's body is pulled on the other side with force, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult for any of the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a wooden pole, the length of which is two arms, and the width is four fingers, and its thickness is lightened at the armpit in this shape:
And thick cloths should be tied around the rounded top so that the post does not harm the patient.
Then, place the post under the patient's armpit, and extend their arm or hand along the post downwards, and bind the post to the support, the arm, and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm should be placed on a ladder-like support according to its width, and the hand should be extended downwards, and the other side of the body should be suspended on the other side, for the joint will enter quickly.
And when its insertion is complete in whatever way possible, then you should place wool pads under the armpit, and then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder with vinegar and egg white over the entire muscle, wrapping it around it, and then tightly bandage under the armpit with a suitable bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hand should be attached to their neck, left still, and the hand should not be moved for seven days.
And the patient's food should be limited until the limb is strengthened, for this is more conducive to their recovery.
Then, the diet should be increased after seven or five days, and the limb should be exercised.  Thus, if it is firm and not softened, then it is considered healed.
However, if the joint is frequently dislocated due to moisture affecting it or for another reason, then a cautery with three punctures should be administered, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization.
And if all this is done, and after seven days the bandage is loosened and the joint is not firmly fixed, and the plaster and bandage are removed several times, and it is not healed, and it cannot raise that arm to the parts above, then understand that the nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are either cut, stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be put back in its place.
For dislocations occurring near the foot and nipple or the posterior parts, reduction is achieved by pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns to its place.
And another bandage should be applied to that area, and it should be treated until it is healed.
And if, after healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original state.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the thigh.
Know that the joint of the thigh is difficult to dislocate and similarly difficult to return to its proper place; and it is dislocated in all directions, especially in the front and back parts.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident under pressure or touch, whatever the specific way in which it is dislocated.  And when you align the dislocated thigh with the healthy one, this is plainly apparent to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its own muscle.
And you should act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes severely inflamed, for if it becomes severely inflamed, reduction is difficult, and the limb is not completely healed; and especially when it is in the rear parts, for it is worse than any other type of dislocation, causing greater pain, and often results in death.
And the restoration, when it is possible to reduce the dislocation, is that the patient's arm should be extended with both hands, and their arm outstretched.  The physician's hands should be placed on the thigh, below it, and the physician should press the joint with the fingers of their hands together, or with the heel of their palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is returned by bending the arm with the hand, until it strikes the thigh with the heel of the palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer forceful extension and a very strong effort.
And it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and hold that extension, two assistants, so that it is not pulled back from the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, since it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over his hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that these things assist in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with a forceful thrust until it returns.
And after the reduction, it is necessary to place it on a compress in which there is astringency and a binding with egg white, and it should be bound with a descending constriction, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left for several days.
And then it should be loosened; and therefore, if the joint is formed in its place, then you loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not properly tightened, then you repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is tightened; and then loosen it.
But if there is a serious accident following the reduction of the joint, and its condition is in motion, then administer moistening in baths and gentle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or place upon the joint a soothing, fatty substance; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put it in a bath; and when it is softened, then you rub the joint with moderate friction, and then repeat the soothing substance, a fatty ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the help of bathing, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place a warm, moistened cow's hide over the opening and press firmly on it; and do this several times, for it is moistening and restores it to its proper condition.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of a dislocated shoulder, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated shoulder (malassen of the hand) is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy.  The opposite is true of other joints, but nonetheless speed is required in its reduction at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes inflamed or a painful abscess develops there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's hand joint on a table, and the attendant extends the patient's arm, and the physician places their hand, or palm, over the protruding area of the joint and presses it until it returns to its proper place.
However, it must be considered if the palm has already been pulled towards the front of the hand; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table below the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is in front of the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be precisely on the table, so that the physician's hand can press on that protruding area of the joint.
And so, if it returns quickly, it is good; and if not, then grasp it firmly, avoiding the abscess, and leave it; and do not repeat this, because otherwise, neither tolerance nor success in its reduction will be possible since days will pass.
However, if the joint remains in its dislocated position, and the patient feels no cause for the problem, but that the hand is numb and cannot grip anything, then know that the nerves are severed or damaged, and there is no remedy for this, but the affected area should be cauterized near the point of injury, and to do this forcefully may yield some relief.
Therefore, once the injury is corrected, apply a bandage as previously described, and leave it on and firmly wrapped for five days; then, it should be removed and the patient's hand should be exercised.
But if the patient's movement is impeded and some heaviness occurs, then ease it with warm water and some rubbing several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in any direction.
And when any of those fingers are dislocated toward the palm or the underside of it, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your fingers until it returns to its proper place.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend it over the part to which it was dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is properly set in its place.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for some days until it is healed.
And do likewise if it is dislocated toward the underside of the hand, and bind it to that part and do your first operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do this for dislocations in other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and the displaced vertebrae remain significantly out of place, then there is no cure in that case, for death is approaching the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excretion is involuntary and uncontrollable; and often some of his limbs or both legs or both arms, or one of them, are paralyzed, or a vertebra is out of place, because often it is displaced and sometimes the displacement affects four limbs.
Therefore, this has already shifted to the posterior parts and is called a sprain/dislocation (literally, "posteriority").
But the treatment for this is that you must consider if the sprain/dislocation occurred due to youthfulness, for in that case, there is no cure, nor is it a complete recovery.
But in cases of sprain/dislocation resulting from an accident, a blow, or similar causes, the ancients described detailed methods of treatment, from which the most benefit can be derived. However, I will now briefly summarise the essential points to avoid unnecessary length, as my close proximity to you and my desire to explain this clearly and concisely, using various methods that I will demonstrate, and make this clear.
And only those sprains/dislocations that occur in the back (specifically, as I will describe) can be cured.
And it is necessary that the patient be laid on their face, propped up against a wall, and be covered by a wet cloth to prevent their foot from being disturbed.
And a straight piece of wood should be placed, driven into the ground near the head of the patient's body, and another piece of wood positioned under the patient's feet on the opposite side of the wall.
And one attendant should hold the first piece of wood, and it should not be embedded too deeply; and another attendant should hold the second piece, following the same procedure.
And then wrap a cloth around the patient's head and bind a strong linen bandage firmly beneath it; and extend the end of the bandage to the piece of wood positioned near the patient's head, and tie it there; and then tightly bandage the other end of the bandage around the patient's hips, thighs, and legs; and finally secure all the bandages to the piece of wood by the patient's feet.
And then each attendant should extend the bandage to the end of the wood, and the two pieces of wood and the bandages should not be shifted from their positions, but still not too tightly, as we have described.
And the physician places their palms firmly on the spine until it returns to its proper position, or they place a table there, and then adjust the patient's feet upon the table until they return to their proper position.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a table whose width or length is approximately three arms' lengths, and make a recess in the wall near the patient where the end of the table fits in. And then place half of the table onto the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, turn the crank that is held by hand; and you must place two pieces of wood, each a yard long, on the ground behind the patient's head and two more behind their feet; the space between each pair of pieces should be a palm's width.  A hole should be made in each piece of wood through which the crank can turn, and each piece of wood must be firmly anchored to the ground to prevent movement.
And a round post, which the crank is on, should be turned within the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at the end of that [round post] is a hole into which the post (the crank) fits, the length of which is a palm along with what is turned; and in the other two pieces of wood is something similar to that.
And then tighten the bandages you have placed around the patient's feet in the hole at the head end [of the device], and the bandages placed around their thighs in the crank at the foot end.
And now, at each crank, stands a minister who turns the crank with their hand, and the physician applies the treatment to the spinal column as we have described.
And after the spinal column has been returned and the area treated, then it is necessary to apply a thick poultice with egg white, then linen strips; and then place over the poultice a piece of table linen whose width is about three fingers or so, and its length covers the area of the swelling, and extends over the affected part of the spinal column.
And then bind it with the bandage we have mentioned, and let the patient use subtle nourishment until healed.
And if any lingering issue remains in the area after healing, then medicines that soften and soothe must be administered via table application for a long time, as we have described; and a lead plate should be applied to that location.
And sometimes an issue arises in the back of the spinal column, caused by that dislocation; and that is the bone which protrudes, so it is not advisable to use this medicine upon it, for it will very likely cause death.
Chapter 31.
Of the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint are subject only to dislocation, and not to the kind of issues that affect other joints with minor movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inward, or outward, or forward, or backward.
And it is more often dislocated inward, and less so forward or backward.
And a sign of its dislocation inward is that when you align the patient's healthy leg with the injured one, the affected leg is longer, and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin, and the affected area near the groin is inflamed with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh bone has now reached there.
And the sign of dislocation outward is that the symptoms are opposite to this one.
And the sign of dislocation forward is that the patient stretches their leg to its full extent, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if they try to go forward they cannot; and their urine is retained and their groin is abscessed, and they walk on their heel.
And the sign of dislocation backward is that the knee does not extend, nor can it be bent forward as far as the groin; and the affected leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is swollen, and the head of the thigh bone is towards that place.
But the reduction of these types of dislocations is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and longstanding, having been there a while, you should administer its reduction and it will stay in its position, then that treatment isn't complete. And therefore, it's not appropriate to assume success in that instance.
But in the case of a recent dislocation, one of the four types, you attempt to return the joint and extend it in all directions, both inward and outward, and move it to the right and left, for a light push usually returns it and requires no further treatment.
However, if it doesn't return in this way, then you must prepare strong assistants and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either with their own hands or with a bandage tied above the knee.  Another assistant should extend the patient's hand so that they grasp their own ankles. Then, another assistant should firmly bind a bandage around the root of the thigh, and a third assistant should hold the end of the bandage.
And its extension should be either from the inside of the groin to the outside, or from the back to the spine (or buttock).
And the extension of all these must be done in one go, until the patient is lifted off the ground by his own body weight and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is a common method for all four types (of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have described, it is good; and if not, then for each type, it is necessary to proceed to the appropriate treatment.
In the specific reduction of a dislocation, when the dislocation is inward, the patient should be placed on their healthy side; then apply bandages to the root of the thigh in the area between the thigh's head and the area below the groin; and then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the highest point of the pubic bone.
And then another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, and forcefully grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outward with vigorous extension, for this will return it to its proper place.
And this type has an easier cure, with which this limb is reduced than the other types.
However, if you are hesitant and do not comply with this type of treatment entirely, then it is necessary to tie the patient's two feet together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both heels.
And the length of each part should be about four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by about two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended over the top of a wooden post, and kept in this position; and the height of the patient from the ground should be about two arms' length.
And then order a strong young man to grasp the thigh, and have another young man suspend the patient, while the first young man, forcefully pulling on the thigh, will cause the joint to return to its proper place quickly.
However, in the proper reduction, when the dislocation is outwards, the patient should lie on a pillow as we have previously described in the bent-knee position; and the bandage should be tightly wrapped around the affected leg and around their foot.
And then two posts should be placed, one at their feet, and the other at their head; and then posts should be placed in the middle of the hill, covered with moistened cloths, so that the patient is not harmed by the post being between their thighs, so that the extension of the parts below is not pulled.
And then each attendant should extend their part, and the physician with their hand should guide the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the forward parts, then it is necessary that the leg be slightly extended, and it is according to this same narrative on a hill; and the physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected limb, and then grasps it with the other hand, and with that grasping, places the extended part below to the front part.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, but rather elevated above the ground; it is necessary that they be placed on a hard surface, just as is necessary for the extraction if their hip is dislocated outward, according to what we have said about their positioning on two supports; and it is on their face, and their ligaments be extended, as we have said, not much.
And it is necessary to administer compression with a table over the location where the joint is.
So, once the reduction is complete, as it should be—and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see that they are straight and the patient straightens their leg and expands it without hesitation, then know that the limb has been returned correctly—and then you bring the two thighs together and apply a compress and bandage tightly so the hip is not moved in any direction; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then remove the bandage and compress, and compare one leg with the other.
Now, if you see them straight, then know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then allow the patient to go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and compress that, and tighten it according to your initial tightening, and leave it for three days.
And then loosen it, and have the patient walk slowly for a few days until they are stronger.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, but not forward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that when you instruct the patient to extend their leg from the thigh, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all cases is to have the patient lie down straight, so that they extend their leg as far as possible; hold the patient's body close to your side, and place the patient's foot between your feet; then firmly hold the patient's knee with both hands, placing your fingers around the knee; and another assistant extends their leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that their leg adheres to the thigh with effortless ease.
Then apply a plaster and firmly bind the leg to the thigh with a bandage for three or four days, and then remove the bandage.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days, until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction by you is unnecessary, then administer strong extension with the bandages, which the narrative previously described for hip treatment.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
The ankle is sometimes dislocated by a slight displacement, and sometimes dislocated completely; and its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that the ankle often swells on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for the slight displacement is a gentle reduction, and it is that the ankle be gently stretched and held until it returns to its place.
However, in treating a completely dislocated ankle, you must have the patient lie straight, and have a strong and capable assistant hold the back of the affected leg in the middle of the leg's position.
Then you, with your right hand, take hold of the foot's upper part, and with your left hand, the lower part of the foot, at the ankle's location.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left, twice, and then push the foot with the left; and push the foot's heel with your right toward the leg, without difficulty.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the foot's heel against the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
So if it returns in one or two attempts according to this method, and if you see the foot is pulled back in, it is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure on it, for it returns (or has returned).
But if you are prevented from reducing it by what we have described, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tightly press a firm pad on the ground, placed between their thighs, and you have already draped a cloth over them so the patient does not get hurt.
And then the attendant holds the patient's thighs, and another attendant extends the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the ankle; and then each attendant extends against the other's extension, and the pad is placed between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that the patient's body is not pulled to the lower parts, beyond its extension.
And then the physician grasps the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh at the lower parts, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And so, when the dislocation returns and the success of its reduction is evident to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with bandages.
And it is necessary to be careful of or guard against the nerves that are behind the heel, so that the bandage on it is not forceful and injures it severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from activity for 40 days. But if he is forced to move before that period, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if an abscess occurs, then you should apply what was previously described in our narrative, in another location for treatment and application, until it has subsided.
Chapter 34.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the foot.
The dislocated part needs to be pulled back gently without force; this is not difficult, but rather easy.
However, if the dislocation is in some toes of the foot, then you should have the patient place their foot on a soft, level surface, like the ground or a table, and remain positioned as if they were walking.
Then you stand, place your foot on the area above the joints, and gently press it with your foot until it returns, and you see it is now in place and no longer protruding.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, covering the entire foot, with two ends; secure it with a proper and firm bandage for three days; and afterward, loosen the bandage and allow the patient rest and avoid walking for several days until the joint is stable and the position is secure.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations caused by blows, or fractures, or both.
When any of these causes occur, and you exert yourself in the treatment and restoration, often death results.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat such a case, but only those knowledgeable in the art, with long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and they should initially use medicines that soothe acute inflammations, and leave the patient to divine judgment, unless there is hope for recovery from the illness and in that you see any hope. Therefore, strive to perform the reduction as soon as possible at the onset of the condition, before it becomes a severe inflammation.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that soothes acute inflammation and treats the injury with whatever drying ointments are appropriate.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must reduce the displacement, and do in this what has been said concerning simple injuries in similar locations.
Guard and avoid, according to your ability, the dangers in the paths of fear, as my teaching precedes you; for this is better for you from your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more beneficial to your body.  This will be the case in your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, of which may God be praised. Amen.
