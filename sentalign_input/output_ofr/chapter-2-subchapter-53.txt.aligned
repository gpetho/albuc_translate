of the canker/ulcer We have spoken in the division about the appearances of a canker/ulcer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid treatment with iron/surgery;	On the treatment of cancer. We have spoken, in the relevant section, of the kinds of cancer and of the way in which medical treatment of them is to be attempted; with a warning against treatment by the knife lest they ulcerate. We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.	0.7558191
and we say the canker/ulcer degenerates into necrosis, and great caution is needed in the treatment, and the ancients said that when a canker/ulcer is in a place where it can be scraped, like a canker/ulcer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, it should be completely removed when it is in the beginning;	We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment. The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried).	0.7141006
nor has anyone ever healed one before me.	For I myself have never been able to cure any such, nor have I seen anyone else succeed before me.	0.653306
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile;	The procedure in a case amenable to treatment, as we have said, is first for the patient to be purged several times from black bile; then bleed him if his veins seem full.	0.69916487
then have them bled if there is manifest plethora, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;	Then put the patient in the most convenient position for operating.	0.5511753
then cast your hooks or pincers, and pull it from all sides, and remove it completely without leaving anything behind;	Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	0.47308016
and let the blood flow freely, and press the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.	If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.62993723
