O dearest sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its fulfillment, and have made its end through its expositions and its declarations.
And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery."
And because the work of hands is withdrawn in our region and is completely foreign, thus the science is perished and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have changed.
And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will come with the forms of iron cautery tools, and other instruments of the work with the addition of its declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant.
And it behooves one who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so much that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of bones and nerves and arms and their number, and the movement and of moving veins and resting ones, and of the place of their exit.
And therefore Hippocrates says that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; especially in the art of hands.
We tell you at the beginning of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things should beware lest he fall into error and kill people; thus I have seen many times several of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula in a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; wherefore so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from a man of age, and the stone was large; thus he took with it a piece of the bladder, and the man was dead within 3 days.
And I had already been called there to extract it, and saw the disposition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew well that if one cut him he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break had a wound; and the physician full of ignorance bound the break over the wound with splints by strong binding, and did not leave any opening for the wound, and left it thus for a time; and commanded him not to unbind it; and remained thus until the leg was all swollen and the foot and came to perdition.
I was called to come to him, and hastened to come unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless the corruption was already confirmed in the member, and I could not heal it; and the corruption did not cease to go through the member until the member was completely lost.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and then inflamed it through the malice of his lordship.
For cancer, when it is pure of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron if it is not in such a place that one can completely remove what is corrupted.
And therefore, dearest sons, it is necessary for you to know that work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in several dispositions; and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore it is necessary that you take care, so that foolish doctors cannot speak ill of you. Take your instruments with concern, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by God's grace you achieve success and are praised; and leave aside frightening diseases of difficult healing; and keep your instruments away from what makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: "Do not take on treatment of a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish doctor."
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterization by fire and cauterization by strong medicine, and the chapter is ordered from head to feet; and about the forms of instruments, and cauterizing tools, and everything that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and cupping glasses and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things; and the chapter is ordered and includes the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things; and is ordered from head to feet, and about the forms of instruments.
Before we recall the work, it is necessary that I speak about the quality of help and harm for each complexion.
I say that the quality of help and harm is the longest discourse and subtle science and hidden secrets; and many of the wise spoke of this, and agreed on this; and their words suffice me little, for I fear lengthiness.
I say that cauterization helps universally for every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: namely hot complexion without matter, and dry complexion without matter.
In hot and dry complexion together with matter, some made distinctions and said that cauterization is of great help; and others said the opposite: that cauterization is not valuable for illness that comes from heat and dryness.
For the nature of fire is hot, and hot illness should not be treated by heat, nor by dryness; and he who said the opposite claims that cauterization provides great help for hot and dry illness that comes in men's bodies.
For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement.
For I have found it sometimes through experiment.
And yet, let none undertake it except those who have tested it, and who know through long usage the chapter on cauterizations, and the diversity of men's complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the span of time; of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses.
And all doctors assembled and agreed on cauterization.
And know, son, that cauterization with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cauterization with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and only reaches the member that is cooked, and hardly harms other members.
Burning medicines travel from member to member at a distance, and bring to the member illnesses of difficult healing; and by chance kill the patient. Fire, because of its nobility and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and stood upon the truth of things; and therefore I excuse myself from the length of discourse, for it does not please me that I should hide from you the secret that is hidden in fire, and the quality of the work, how it drives away illnesses from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstration; now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauterizations should be made, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is subdued by the help of cautery; and especially if cautery is necessary for severe and urgent pains that cannot wait for fear that greater harm might come to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as do foolish physicians; for an illness that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is nothing but a medicine that changes the constitution, and dries the humors that are the cause of pain, and works better than medicine due to the swiftness of its value, and due to the virtue of its work and its authority.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes comes according to the constitution of the patient and the location of the illness and its strength; and superfluities are gathered in it through the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as dental cautery for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and this is true; but they do not believe that cautery works after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer types of cures for some illness and they do not work, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Thus it appears clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that the cauterized area does not produce rot, but this is not true for I have tested it, and have found that this is true in some men; and gold cautery works better than iron, as they said.
And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly; and if one heats it too much, it melts in the fire; and thus there are many impediments.
And therefore we use iron cautery because we have it better prepared for our work.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to foot, so that the path might be easier to find.
On the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is effective for moisture and cold in the brain, and there are two that are done because of an illness called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for multiple dreams and tooth pain and throat pain, and especially for all illnesses that come from cold such as paralysis and deafness and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The procedure for this cautery is that the patient should be purged by purgative medicine cleansing the head for 3 or 4 nights, according to what the strength and age and constitution of the patient can bear; and then have the patient's head shaved.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his chest; after put the base of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle finger falls, mark it with ink then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which here is the form:
And put it on the spot marked with ink, and proceed downward while tightening your hand little by little while turning; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot to see if you can see the bone a little bit; and if you don't see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you; after take a little salt, and put it in water and wet cotton in it, and put it on the spot, and leave it for 3 days; after put cotton soaked in butter on it; and leave it until the burn is removed; after treat the wound with the ointment that is called "tetrapharmacon," until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges; and therefore it helps better.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burned, and then scrape what is burned from the bone, and it should be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so hard that one removes from the bone something as wide as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors exit better; and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterward one should treat it and close it.
And these two methods of cautery don't seem to me to be completely good, except in some men where there is cause for fear; and it seems better to me that I should leave it; because the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members; and especially when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it then together with safety.
On ancient head pain
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use iris and pills that are called "cochie," and purging of the head and oils and plasters; and if one does the cautery that we mentioned before, and it doesn't work.
Take note if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it isn't too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little that we mentioned above.
After make a cautery on each corner of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses; and lighten your hand so that you don't go down to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere; and it is necessary that the cauteries of the corners be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
About cauterization of the head
When sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been purged by cleansing medicines, and one has done the other treatments that I mentioned in the section on illnesses, and all this does not help: then make cauterizations according to two methods, that is to say with caustic medicine and with iron.
The cauterization with caustic medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can hide the clove of garlic under the skin; and when it is hidden, bind it and tighten it well and leave it thus for 12 hours; and then unbind it and pull out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound thus for 2 or 3 days; then put on cotton soaked in butter until pus comes out.
Afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And it is called "nail" because the head is made in the form of a nail where there is a bit of curve, and in the middle has a small protrusion; and put it on the painful place, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the skin is burned; and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and abundant blood flows.
Afterwards put cotton in salt water, and put it on the place for 3 days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "knife-like," with all the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
About migraine
When you treat migraine as we have said before in the section on illnesses, and it does not help, and you see that the aforementioned cautery of medicine and iron is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery which is called "knife-like" until it is white; and first mark on the painful place a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and tighten it so you do not cut the artery and that you do not come to the bone; and beware of the mandible that moves when one eats, and the nerve that moves it and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of blood flow from the artery when it will be cut, or cutting has great fear and especially to one who does not know it, and who is not studied and experienced; and leave the work halfway; but I will tell you how to stanch blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed; and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
About ear pain from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and one has worked with dissolving medicines and the other treatments that we have mentioned in the section, and the pain does not move, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Afterwards make points all around the sick ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and keep a little distance from the root of the ear after you have marked the place with ink; and have 10 points around each ear; afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
of the distortion of the mouth
Distortion that must be treated by cautery is only of those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the division of diseases; and do not apply cautery to conditions that come from dryness and spasm of nerves.
When you treat this type of distortion that comes from phlegm of hydras and purgations of the head and gargling, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with 3 cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips; and put the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery right at the head of the ear above a bit below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned; and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is the appearance of the knife-like instrument that we have shown before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker; afterwards treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient has no fever, then make 4 cauteries: 2 on the two horns of the head, and 1 in the middle of the head, and 1 in the place called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness one must give the patient large pills purifying the brain; afterwards shave the patient's head completely, and put on the occiput the mustard plaster that is written in the treatise on plasters; and this is the manner of the cautery: do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, good; and if he is not, make him 3 cauteries from the middle of the head descending to the neck, and have a space between each cautery of 1 finger's width; and treat it like the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient can bear it, make him 1 cautery in the middle; and if necessary, 2 others on the two horns, and treat until healed; and let the cautery be what is called "olive-shaped", as I have said before.
of the coldness of the head
It is necessary that the head be purified with pills and with what we have said before; afterwards shave the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each horn, and 1 behind and 3 on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient can bear it, and the illness is strong, make him 4 cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the core is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat until healed, and let the cautery be what is called "olive-shaped" that we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use cautery except for that which is phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to purify the brain with pills and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is grown and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, make him gargle and chew things purifying the brain often with good foods; afterwards shave his head in the middle, and make 1 cautery according to what we have said before, and 1 cautery on the vessel, and on each horn; and if the patient is strong and can bear it, make him cauteries as I have said to the one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner I have said.
If the patient is a child, make him 1 subtle cautery according to this manner:
When due to melancholy the superfluities or humors are corrupted and phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for those who have paralysis.
And if due to melancholy the superfluities are declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain shall be purified, according to what was stated before in the division.
After shave the patient's head; after make a well-made ring of linen, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head; and have the patient sit cross-legged, and be well held from all sides; after apply the liniment, and aged sheep's butter works better; and heat it on fire moderately, so that fingers if inserted can bear it; after empty the circle from within the middle of the head, and let it cool; and do this to the patient once every week with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize him by making several points with all the cautery.
This manner of cautery moistens the brain equally; and then put cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat on top.
On water in the eyes
When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have described in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that purifies the head, and guard him from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times while fasting.
After command him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries above the two temples if the descent of water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one; and cut with all the cautery all the veins and arteries that are below the skin, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and guard yourself from blood flow, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stanch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stanch it; and sometimes one makes cautery in the nape below the two back bones.
On the flow of tears
When the tears of the eyes are old and habitual and are above the veins, or beside the arteries that are in the outer appearance of the head; and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make the cautery that I have mentioned at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the nape below the two bones; and if there is need for more, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the flow of tears inside the eyes
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not profit at all, then give to drink to the patient for three nights at bedtime; after shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle with the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair; and guard yourself from cutting the artery.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare."
Of which here is the form:
And if you wish then make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are; and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have described.
about the hair that pricks the eye
Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, and one applies cautery in two ways: namely by fire, or by burning medicine.
For cautery by fire, command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even; and if they prick at their root, hold their eyes so they don't move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your lap; afterward mark on the eyelid a shape that is like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be beside the hairs; then put cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery which has this form:
After, cauterize over the shape that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned there; and the sign of the success of the procedure is that you see the eyelid retracted, and the hairs raised from pricking the eye; then lift your hand, and leave it thus for 3 days, then put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterward treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the hairs come back, and the eyelid is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, just as you did at first; and if the hairs are outside, cauterize until the eyelid is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery with burning medicine is that you command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf; then take French soap and quicklime, one dram of each, and grind together well; and do it hastily, so it doesn't cool, then spread it over the shape that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid; and if the malady affects only one eye, one should work on one, and if on both likewise; and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press a little and move it every time the patient feels burning from the medicine, for they feel burning as if from fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger.
And when the burning has passed, wash the place with water, and look if you see the eyelid raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is good.
If not, put more of the medicine on the place where the medicine hasn't worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are set right; then put on cotton soaked in butter until the burned flesh has fallen off, afterward treat the place with the ointment that is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you guard well your work with great care that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the eyelid becomes soft afterward, and the hairs prick the eye, begin the medicine again on that place of the eyelid that has softened, just as you did before; afterward treat it until it is healed; and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that men's eyes are different in size and smallness, and according to this should be your constraints; and let not the right way be hidden from him who studies this art.
On the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat fistula as we have described in the division of diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then it is necessary that you perform cautery in this manner.
Command the patient to put his head in your lap; and have the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he cannot move or shake his head; then put cotton soaked in egg white or in parsley juice over the eye; then heat the cautery which is like this: and is fitted at the end like the shape of a bird's feather, together with which is the cautery; if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it can be like a tent [surgical dressing]; but nevertheless, the one that is fitted is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the matter; then apply the very hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery on the side of the nerve away from the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cauterization, that would be good.
If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for 3 days; afterward put cotton soaked in butter on it, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if 40 days pass without it being healed, then apply sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what will come in its chapter.
And there is a type of cautery for fistula that some of the ancients described.
Pay attention to the fistula, and split the area; then put in the split a fine rod of which this is the shape:
and they make it to the quantity of a dram of lead; and hold your hand firmly on the rod, and the patient must not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye; and it is necessary to put on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg whites or in water: the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good.
If not, then it is necessary to make a hole at the nerve, and bring the fistula to the body of the nerve according to what is required in its proper place.
On cracks in the lips
Very often cracks occur in lips that are called "hair," and especially in children's lips.
When you treat these cracks with what we have described in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-like cautery of this shape:
And put it quickly in these cracks until it reaches the bottom; afterward treat the area with wax until it is healed.
On abscess of the mouth
When an abscess comes in the root of the mouth or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then makes pus and breaks and becomes old and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have described in divisions, and it is not effective: then it is necessary that you have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; then push it into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its bottom and final place; and do this once or twice, then treat it with what we have described in treatments, until it is healed; and if it is cured thus, that is good; and if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
On loose teeth
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines and this does not work, then put the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose shape will come hereafter in such a way that you put a reed on the tooth; and put inside it the hot cautery quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth; then lift your hand and repeat the cautery according to your judgment; afterward have the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this way the tooth that was loose is strengthened, and the softened gum tightened, and the corrupted moisture dried.
On tooth pain
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold or truly, and medical cures are ineffective, then there is need for cautery in two ways: butter cautery and fire cautery.
Butter cautery is such that you take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron or brass spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a probe, and soak it in boiled butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold until it cools; and do this often until its power reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The fire cautery is such that you take an iron or brass tube, and let it be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth; then heat the cautery, whose form will come hereafter, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools; do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill their mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery:
And make the cautery from whichever end you wish, and according to what you are able; and this is the form of the tube:
On scrofula
When scrofulas are from phlegm and cold moistures, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, then heat the hollow cautery whose form comes hereafter, and let it have two openings for the fumes to exit the cautery on the other side; and put the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess; and if the abscess is small then apply cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterwards treat the place with ointments and probes until it is healed.
The form of the tube:
When moistures overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from cold complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be first emptied by purgative medicines; afterwards make a cautery at the root of the throat, and take care that you do not come up to the throat, and burn the flesh only a little.
Afterwards make another cautery at the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let it be the cautery which is called "clavicle" whose form we have before; and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
On cough
When cough and lung disease are from cold moistures, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the hollow of the chest in empty places; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let it be the cautery which is called "clavicle" according to the form which is said before.
And if you wish, make puncture cautery with the cautery which is called "points" whose form is given before in the disease of the ears; and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
Afterwards treat the place according to what is said before, and let the cautery have three prongs according to this form:
And for this the cauteries are easier, because you make three at once.
On the dislocation of the humerus (de la dislocation de l'ajutoire)
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and one puts it back in place, and it cannot stay but rather keeps coming out with small movements that occur, as we have observed, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Afterwards, let the patient lie on his back and on his side; then lift the flesh that is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward, heat the cautery that has 2 prongs, of which here is the form:
and cauterize the flesh until it pierces through to the side, and the pattern of the cautery will come together as 4 cauteries; and for this reason the cautery is made with the cautery that has 3 prongs, so that the pattern of cauterization makes six cauteries; and the prongs are according to the thinness of a probe and this is the form of the cautery that has 3 prongs:
And sometimes one prong is added to this so that there are 8 cauteries.
Afterwards, put crushed leeks with salt on the cautery; then let the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness with the nail-shaped cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed again, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture come to the stomach so much that they draw it to their condition, and catarrhs multiply in it, and in the customary ways of treatment it does not benefit, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
After this, make him 3 cauteries: 1 below the breast bone by the measure of one finger, with the nail-shaped cautery, and 2 cauteries outside the two sides so that the pattern of the cauteries forms a triangle, and let there be such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they will discharge pus; and let the cauteries be so deep that they take up two parts of the flesh, and let the pattern of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and for one who will be afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish in ink; then cauterize it with the cautery that is called "points."
Afterwards, treat it with the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and thick windiness, so much that it is put out of its natural condition by the superfluities; and the patient is treated for what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his nape; and mark in ink 3 cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, there where the elbow of the man comes; and let there be space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much with the cautery; and let only half of the flesh be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet; and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms; and this is the form:
And if it is your wish, then cauterize these cauteries with the knife-shaped one, if you are subtle and wise in the art, and take care that you do not burn all the flesh, for you would make the whole body dry up; and that it does not come up to the bowel, for the flesh is very thin there, and know this for truth.
