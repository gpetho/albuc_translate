Chapter Twenty-Seven:
On the cauterization of a cold liver.
When there is pain in the liver due to coldness or humidity or large amounts of gas, causing it to deviate from its normal state due to the expulsion of excesses, and the patient is not cured with the previously mentioned treatments, then the patient should lie on their back, and mark three cauteries in this form and this same amount on the liver below the hypochondria, where the human decubitus is.
And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be along the length of the body straight.
And do not compress the area too much with the cautery.
And if the amount that is burned is the size of half the thickness of the tendon, and it should not be too tight; and if the patient is standing, then let them stand on their feet; if they are not standing, then they should lie down, with their legs extended and their arms raised.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery if you have the skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the whole thickness of the tendon be burned so that the entire body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the tendon here is delicate; and know this.
