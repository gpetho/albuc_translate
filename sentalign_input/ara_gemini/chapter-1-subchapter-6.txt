Chapter Six on Cauterizing the Jaw Muscle.
The facial paralysis that is treated with cautery is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of facial paralysis with errhines, sternutatories, and gargles, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations: one at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the joining of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because the relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
And the method of cautery is to cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Apply the cautery down with your hand until you burn half the thickness of the skin.
And this is the image of the cautery instrument, and it is a type of scalpel-like instrument whose image has been presented, except that it is a little gentler, as you see.
And the knife should have a little extra thickness.
Then treat the area with what was mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.
