The author of this book says: When I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of the science of medicine in its completeness, and have reached the utmost in its clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its effect has ceased. And there remain only a few traces of it in the books of the ancients, which have been copied by hands and marred by error and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its usefulness has been diminished.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to include pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this adds to the clarity and facilitates what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must beforehand practice in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and knows the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number, origins, and the pulsating and non-pulsating vessels, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned a part of this in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned concerning anatomy will inevitably make mistakes that kill people, as I have often witnessed among those who have imagined themselves skilled in this science and claimed it without knowledge or study.
And that is because I saw an ignorant physician who incised a scrofulous tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the arteries of the neck, so the woman bled until she fell dead before him.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had a fistula, and the stone was large, so he acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder substance. So the man died after about three days, and I had been called to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the patient that I could have done it.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine with some of the pimps of our city.
Then it happened to a black boy who had a fracture in his leg near the heel with a wound, and the physician, in his ignorance, hastened and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and did not leave the wound any space to breathe.
Then he indulged his desires, then he left him for days and ordered him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death.
Then I was called to him, and I hastened to untie the bandage, so he gained relief and recovered from his pains, except that the corruption had become entrenched in the limb, and I was not able to stop it.
Then the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after days until the affliction of its owner became great, and that is because if the cancer is purely of black humor, then it should not be exposed to iron at all.
Except it be in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety, and work accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned in every place that comes in this book against work which contains risk and fear, and you should avoid and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and criticize, so take for yourselves caution and circumspection, and for your patients gentleness and deliberation.
And use the best method leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases difficult to cure.
And purify yourselves from that which you fear might cast doubt on your religion and your worldly affairs, for it is more enduring for your prestige and higher in this world and the next for your destinies.
For Galen said in some of his precepts, “Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become bad physicians.”
This chapter is divided into three sections.
The first section.
Concerning cautery with fire and cautery with strong medicine, arranged in order from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cautery irons, and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
Concerning incision, puncture, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all arranged in order with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third section.
Concerning setting and reduction, and the treatment of dislocations and the like, arranged in order from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first section.
Concerning cauterization.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
And I say that discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization is a lengthy discourse, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken of it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened their speech for fear of lengthening [the text].
And I say that cauterization generally benefits every ill temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed concerning it. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite: that cauterization is not suitable in an illness that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to cure a hot, dry illness with a hot, dry medicine. And he who says the opposite says that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot, dry illness that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except someone who has practiced and trained in the art of cauterization to a great extent. And he has observed the differences in people's temperaments and the state of illnesses in themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold, wet illnesses, for all physicians have agreed on them and have not differed in the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cauterization with fire and its advantage over cauterization with a burning drug, because fire is a simple element whose effect does not exceed the member that is cauterized, and it does not harm another connected member except slightly.
And cauterization with a burning drug may extend its effect to other members, and may cause in the member an illness difficult to treat, and may even kill.  Fire, because of its nobility and the excellence of its substance, does not do that except if one exceeds.
This has become clear to us through experience, long service, attention to the craft, and understanding the realities of the matter.
For this reason I have dispensed with lengthy discussion. If it were not unbecoming of this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its expulsion of illnesses, with philosophical, demonstrative discourse too subtle for your understanding.
And know, my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and they have considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time, because the harm resulting from the time is consumed by the benefit obtained through cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for strong, necessary, urgent pains which do not tolerate delay, because of the fear that what follows will be a calamity greater than the slight harm caused by the time.
And let it not occur to you, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a certain illness will never return, and that you should consider it a guarantee.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cauterization is only like a medicine which alters the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cauterization is preferred to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its effect.
And it is possible that the illness may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of his illness, and the accumulation of humors in his body, and his negligence in acquiring them from foods and similar causes.
Except that the illness in which cauterization is used is a mild illness and in a member with few humors and moisture. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like, for it is possible that the pain may not return in it, and this is in the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cauterization is the last of medicine, it is a correct saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment benefits with medicine or without it after the occurrence of cauterization, and the matter is otherwise.
And the meaning of cauterization being the last of medicine is that when we use types of treatment in an illness and those medicines do not work, then we use cauterization as the last thing, and it works, then from here it is said that cauterization is the last of medicine. Not in the meaning to which the common people and many ignorant physicians went.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cauterization does not suppurate, and this is not absolute.
Because I have tried it and found that it only does that in some bodies, not others, and cauterization with it is better and more excellent than iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire, made of gold, you will not know when it is heated to the degree you want because of the redness of the gold.
And because it quickly gets cold, and if you increase its heat in the fire it melts and flows, so the artisan is troubled by that. Therefore, cauterization with iron is, for us, faster and nearer to correctness in practice, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections that I have organized from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to find what he wants, God willing.
The first chapter.
On cauterizing the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the excess of moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the causes of headache and frequent catarrhs from the head to the region of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pains. And in short, for every illness that appears from coldness, like paralysis, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The image of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then you place the base of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, whose image is this.
Expose the bone the size of a clove or a carob seed. Then lift your hand; otherwise, if it cools, repeat the process with the same or another instrument. Until you see what I have described of the bone. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it. Place this on the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter and leave it there until the eschar from the cautery separates. Then treat it with the Quadruple Ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it discharges, and that this is better and more effective.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin down to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone thickness is burned, then removing the burned bone and treating it afterwards.
Others said that one should be excessive with the cautery, so that it strongly affects the bone, until it falls away from the bone like a small carat or flake. They claimed that this vents the vapors of the head from that place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals. I do not see these two types of cauterization at all except in some people, and in a haphazard way. In my opinion, leaving it alone is better and safer, because if the natural connection is broken, the head is weakened, as we have seen in other members.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak.  The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so use it and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and persists in the patient, and applications, gargles, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if a single cauterization, as we described, has been done and nothing has helped, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above that. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed. And cauterize him at the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient feels a severe pain from this, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the temples and the back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head, and this is its image.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing the non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient vomit with purgative medicines for the head, and use all the treatment that I mentioned in the divisions of diseases; if that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it and cut its ends from both sides, then incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin large enough for the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it for about fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Dress it with cotton soaked in butter until the place suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  If you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines which I gave in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery, which is of this form:
It is called the nail-cautery because its head is like the head of a nail, with some pitting and a small projection in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little, and the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be about half of it. Raise your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and apply it to the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with ointment, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like end of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this chronic migraine in particular.
Chapter Four.
In chronic migraine.
If you treat the migraine with what we mentioned of the aforementioned treatment and what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see a cause for which what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is not sufficient. Then it is necessary to heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white, after you have marked the painful area with a line half a finger's length or so, and you should pull your hand once while tightening it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Except that you should be careful not to touch the jaw, which moves when chewing, so that you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, which would cause spasm.
And be cautious and watchful of the bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing and has not been a trained and experienced person; and leaving the work is better.
And the treatment of bleeding that occurs from the artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing, if you see something in the illness that this cauterization cannot treat.
And you saw the patient's body enduring, cauterize in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on the incision of the artery with the two-bladed cautery; for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing earaches.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold, and it is treated with laxatives and all the treatments that we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery which is called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply it with points around the entire ear, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little distance from the base of the ear, after marking the spot with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the areas until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
Cauterization of the tonsils.
The tonsils treated by cauterization are of the type caused by phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
Cauterization of the type caused by dryness and nerve tension should be avoided.
If you have treated this type of tonsil with applications, snuffs, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the base of the ear, a second slightly below his temple, and a third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the diseased area, because relaxation occurs on the apparently healthy side.
The cauterization should be done with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, slightly below the temple, and another in the temple, its length being equal to the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery; it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has preceded this, but it is slightly gentler, as you see. The scalpel should be slightly thicker. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment is ineffective, and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize him in four places. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously mentioned.
The application of the cautery is as previously described.  It may also be cauterized at the mouth of the stomach, which will be more effective, and then treat it as before.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterizing forgetfulness.
If it is due to phlegm, the patient should first be given large purgatives and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then his entire head should be shaved, and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on poultices, should be applied to the back of his head repeatedly, for this is a type of cauterization.
Do this in the same manner as I have described there.  If he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, cauterize three times at the back of his head, the cauterizations aligned from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger. Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the treatment] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle again.
If you wish to increase [the treatment], cauterize the temples, then treat it until it heals. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and general body relaxation.
You should first purify the head with purgatives and as we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, and cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one at the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in the case of relaxation of the body, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and persistent, cauterize with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. And continue cauterizing until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand, and treat him as previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing. The cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be purged with strong purgatives and with the other treatments we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and able to take medication.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, as previously described, and another cautery at the back of the head. And one cautery on each temple of his head. If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauteries mentioned for the paralytic and the person with relaxation of the body, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and the cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned for the paralytic.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined to black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge his brain as was explained previously in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle, then place it in the middle of his head, while the patient sits cross-legged holding it from every side, then take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it over a fire to a moderate heat, as much as the finger can tolerate when inserted into it, then pour it into the middle of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once a week along with other good treatment until he is cured, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures without holding your hand to the cautery, but rather let it be a fumigation, for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply to it cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing the water that descends into the eye.
If the descending water in the eye becomes apparent to you through the signs which I mentioned in the classification, then act quickly and purge the patient of what fouls his head and cleanse him of all humors and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize him in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the descent of the water began in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the width of the temples, and guard against bleeding.
If you see some of it, cut it on the spot with whatever treatment is possible for you, and we will come to the wisdom in cauterizing and cutting the arteries and guarding against bleeding.
And he may be cauterized in the nape of the neck under the two bones with two deep cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, from outside the head, and you are certain that it is from cold, thick, phlegmatic excess, then cauterize it with the cautery that I described in its place at the beginning of the descending water. A cauterization in the middle of the head and two cauterizations on the temples and two cauterizations in the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need more, then cauterize one cauterization on each side of the tail of the eye at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing the foul smell of the nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment does not work, then quickly purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle with the olive-shaped cautery. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery two cauterizations above the eyebrows, a little below the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it. And this is the image of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes from illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize above the eyebrows a little, two cauterizations on each side, and keep them distant from the temples, and the length of each cauterization should be the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate with the cauterization, but only to the extent that a third of the skin burns, and the shape of the cautery should be in this manner.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins turn inward, so that the eye is inverted, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning drug. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
For if you cauterize it while they are growing, then bind his eyes with a bandage lest they move until they grow.  Then when they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark a sign on the eyelid with ink in the shape of an "as" leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins. Then place under the eyelid a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron, this is its form.
Then cauterize according to the mark little by little in many times until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the "as" leaf, is entirely burnt, especially its surface. A sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid curled up and the hair raised from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab with ointment until the scab is removed, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization on that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, pull it out until it returns to its natural place and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a burning medicine, it is that you instruct the patient to leave the margins until they grow long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of an as leaf. Then take from the usual soap and from unslaked lime, from each one a weight of a dirham or so, and grind them both well together, and do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper which you made in the shape of the as leaf and place it on one or both eyelids and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head in your lap.
And place your index finger above the medicine and press it slightly while you move it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, because he will feel a sting like fire. As long as he feels the sting, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the sting subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look; if you see the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or with cutting, otherwise repeat applying the medicine to the place where the medicine did not affect it and did not blacken, until you complete your work and the eyelid is cauterized. Then put cotton with butter on it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another until it heals.  It is necessary for you during the work to be extremely careful that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after a few days and we fear something like hair in the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to that place of the eyelid which has relaxed, specifically as you did first, then treat it until it heals. And this is the image of the as leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so let your cauterization be according to that. The correct method is not hidden from one who is experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the cancerous sore which appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the cancerous sore with what we mentioned in the classification of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You should order the patient to place his head in your lap, and a servant should hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move or shake.
Then you place a cotton swab moistened with egg white or the saliva of a frog on his eyes, then you heat the cautery iron, whose image is this.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather at the one end which performs the cauterization; and if you wish it to be perforated at the other end, and if you wish it to be solid like an awl, but this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the sore if it is open and remove the pus and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus.  Then apply the cautery iron to it while it is very hot, holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly during cauterization, away from the eye toward the nose, lest your hand err or the patient be disturbed, causing the cautery iron to fall onto the white of the eye and damage it.  If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, reapply the cautery iron a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and denuded, as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients:  You approach the location of the fistula, incise it, then place a thin cone in the incision itself; this is its image.
Then pour into it the weight of a dirham of molten lead, holding the cone firmly and securely; the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye. It is necessary to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead will burn the fistula and cure it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment we have mentioned, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use the perforation of the nose and return the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be detailed in its appropriate place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing fissures of the lip.
A fissure often occurs in the lip, called a hair, especially in the lips of children; it occurs frequently. If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, heat a small, knife-shaped cautery of this shape.
Let its cavity be like the thinness of a knife, then apply it, heated quickly, into the fissure itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure; then treat it with the kyrioty until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and from the flow of pus a fistula results, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert it, heated, into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned of treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the material ceases and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the decayed bone according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing loose molars and gums.
If the gums are relaxed from moisture and the teeth are loose, and you have treated them with medicine and it has not worked, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, the image of which comes after this, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And insert the hot cautery iron quickly, and hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand, then return the cautery iron several times as you wish, then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
And let him hold it for an hour and then spit it out; for the loose tooth will be fixed, and the relaxed gum will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry.
Chapter twenty-one.
On cauterizing a toothache.
If the toothache is from cold, or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medicines has not been effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiled butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.  And if you wish, you may dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, take a brass or iron tube, and let it have some thickness so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron which has the described shape, and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand until the cautery iron cools; do this repeatedly.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or the next day. After this cauterization, it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, and according to what is possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If fistulas are due to phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to ripening with medication, and you desire a quick ripening, then heat a hollow cautery iron, which has this image, perforated at both ends.
So that the smoke exits at the other end during cauterization, place it carefully on the fistula itself, once and twice if necessary, until you reach the depth of the fistula. If the fistula is small, make the cautery iron the size of the fistula.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab soaked in ointment until what was burned by the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail in the trachea, especially if this is accompanied by coldness of temperament, then the patient should first be purged with purgative medicines, then cauterize with a cautery in the hollow of the throat at the base of the larynx in the lower position.
Beware of reaching the larynx with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin. Then apply another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, and let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter twenty-four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, then apply two cauteries above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the cautery should be nail-shaped, in the manner previously described. And if you wish, let your cautery be by puncturing with the cautery called the point, whose image has been previously shown in puncturing earache, and let the punctures be from thirty points or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers.  You may also make a cautery with three branches in this manner, and it hastens the cauterization because you cauterize with it three places at once. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or if it does not remain fixed when it is reduced from its dislocation, so that this becomes a habit to relapse and then dislocate at the slightest movement, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation. Then the patient lies on his back or on his healthy side, and then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery iron with two heads, which is of this form.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the form of the cauterization will be four cauterizations. It may be cauterized with a cautery iron with three heads, in which case the form of the cauterization will then be six cauterizations, and the heads will be on the thinness of a rose petal.
And this is the image of the cautery iron with three heads.
And this number may be increased by one, so that the cauterizations are eight. Then apply to the cauterization the pounded balls with salt, and then let the patient rest and not move the limb for a time until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upwards, and that is rarely the case.
Cauterize above the shoulder with one good, nail-shaped cauterization or many cauterizations in a dotted pattern, for the joint will strengthen, and the moisture will leave, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If coldness and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, to the extent that it is disturbed from its temperament, and frequent catarrhs occur in it, and it is treated with various treatments, but they are not effective, then the patient should lie on his back and extend his legs and arms, then cauterize three cauterizations. One cauterization below the xiphoid process, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations lower down on either side of the first cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is triangular, and spaced apart so that they do not join if they suppurate, and the depth of the cauterization is about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this is the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery with which you cauterize this single cauterization is to be in the shape of a circle, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized by puncturing for whoever shrinks from this cauterization; and that is that you mark points on the stomach with ink to the extent that you want, then cauterize it with a punctate cautery, then treat it with the treatment which has preceded until it heals.
Chapter twenty-seven.
In the cold cauterization of the liver.
If there arises from the liver a pain due to coldness and dampness, or due to a subtle wind, so that it has departed from its natural temperament an excessive departure, and the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and that has not availed. Then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and three cauterizations are marked with ink in this shape and this exact amount on the liver, below the ribs where the human elbow ends.
And after each cauterization, a cauterization should be the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be along the body straight, and do not press down firmly with the cautery iron.
And let the amount of thickness of the skin that you burn be about half, no more, and let the patient stand on his feet; and if he is not standing, let him be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised.  And this is the image of the cautery iron.
And you may be able to cauterize these cauterizations with the knife-like cautery iron if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful lest you overdo the cauterization and burn all the skin, and burn the abdomen and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so know that.
Chapter twenty-eight.
In cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you wish to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will find heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and you see that the physicians have been unable to treat it, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a needle, and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum until all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by someone whose training in the art of medicine has been long and who has experienced these diseases many times by practice; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this way: that you take one long, dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and it should be as thick as a finger, then dip it in oil and heat it in the fire. Then you cauterize with one cauterization between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the jugular veins, leaning towards the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, leaning slightly backward, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind: one between the shoulders and two on the sides of the spine, lower than the cauterization which is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be a superficial burning of the skin.  Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery like a file, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
And the pus is discharged as we mentioned in liver tumors.  In this method of cauterization there is great danger; either the patient dies immediately or a fistula forms at the site which does not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat a spleen ailment with the treatments mentioned in the sections and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all correct: one is to cauterize it with three or four cauterizations aligned along the length of the spleen.
in the shape of the liver cauterizations whose shape we have described before, and between each cauterization and the next should be the width of a finger or a little more. The nature of the cautery should be as we described in the cauterization of the liver, and do not deepen your hand with the cauterization; the patient's position is lying on his back.
The other method is in the flank, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the body.
Then you insert two cauteries, very carefully protected, until you pierce the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery, so there will be four cauterizations; and if you wish, you may cauterize with the other cautery with three points.
Then you treat the cauterized area after you let it discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than all the treatments mentioned before.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascitic dropsy specifically. If you treat the patient with dropsy using the various treatments we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two on his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
And do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to gather the humors for him, so that healing will hasten. The shape of the cautery with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its image was previously shown, and that with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the depression between the little finger and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cautery and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will exude, and the cautery is of this shape.
Then cauterize on the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, and the cauterization is done with the sharp end of the cautery, and the cauterization is along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water may exude from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterization for diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and dampness, so that it weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see that the patient can tolerate cauterization and is strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As was previously described in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four cauterizations around the navel with the gentle nail-shaped cautery iron, and one or two large cauterizations on the coccyx.
If you see that the dampness is abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic, numerous, or single hemorrhoids in the anus, and they are from thick, cold humors or putrid dampness, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the section, but the treatment has not worked, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum, slightly below the coccyx, in a triangular arrangement.
And a cauterization below the navel by the width of two fingers. And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as described before, and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery.  Leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat him until he heals, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it, hot, into the same cut wart and deepen your hand until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with ointments suitable for them until they heal. And if you cauterize it with a large cautery also on cotton, it was more effective in benefit.
Chapter thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula which is in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its place and shrinks from that, then perhaps he will heal with cauterization. If a fistula occurs and the pus and corrupt humors flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the fistula itself, in a straight line along the depth of the fistula and the extent to which the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if it is there, or a large vein, and if the fistula opens into the body of the bladder or into the body of the intestine.
Guard against all these places.  You do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy place and you have estimated that it is not penetrating. Then treat the place until it heals. If the place closes and the matter ceases from it and remains so for a time, then know that it has completely healed.
And if the matter does not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that in its depth there is a corrupt bone or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or a violent wind, and because of that the patient's sexual function decreases, then it is necessary to cauterize him on the loins, on the kidneys themselves.  Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery mentioned previously, and perhaps you may cauterize a third time in the same session, so that there are three cauterizations in a row, which will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him with one cauterization below the navel on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
And the distance after cauterization on each side should be the width of a thumb's breadth, and cauterize with one cauterization in the lower back, or two if needed. The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If a substance from cold and moisture occurs in the uterus, so that it is prevented from conception, and its menstrual flow is corrupted and its course is difficult, or pain occurs to it upon its arrival, then it should be cauterized with three cauterizations around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. And one cauterization on cotton in the lower back, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Sometimes errant moist substances gather in the hip joint, and this becomes a reason for its displacement. Its sign is that the leg is longer than the other when one compares them to each other, and one finds emptiness in the place of the dislocation.  Then one should cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself with a semi-circular cauterization.
After you have drawn with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the middle of the circle. And the cautery, whose image is presented in cauterizing the stomach; if you do not have this cautery, then cauterize with three cauterizations using the large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cauterization be deep enough to encompass the whole thickness of the skin, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause of this is cold and moisture, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the section, and the treatment has not worked, and this has persisted, then it is necessary to evacuate the thick humors from the patient with the bitter apple or the prickly pear and the like.
Then cauterize it, and the cauterization is of two types: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.  Cauterization with fire is done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize on the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization and the next should be the width of a finger. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  You may also cauterize one in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations. And if you wish, cauterize it with the circle which we mentioned previously in cauterizing a dislocated hip—a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the manner of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize two cauterizations on the thigh at the place where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the heel, four fingers towards the lateral side slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron three or four times, or more if necessary. And if he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to cauterize to the point of burning a nerve or a large artery, lest you thereby cause the patient a serious injury or death.
And I have seen one and another who was cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive, so that the leg became inflamed until the inflammation reached the foot, and it became completely perforated, and the entire leg was corrupted, and then diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in the same manner.
And some learned physicians have mentioned regarding the cauterization of the hip a cauterization of this type:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth it should be the thickness of a date pit, or a little less, and inside that cup is another cup, and a third cup.
And the distance between each cup will be the width of the thumb, and the cups will be open on both sides, and their height will be about a finger-breadth or two finger-breadths, and a handle of well-secured iron is made for them. And this is its image.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip joint, the patient leaning on the healthy side, and three round cauterizations are performed at once. Then he is left for three days, and it is bandaged with butter, and the wound is left open for some days.
Many, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The author of this book says that this type of cauterization is rarely used because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because few are found who can endure it, although it is among the best cauterizations for those who endure it and its application is correct.
And as for cauterization with burning medicines, it is that you make two cup-like things resembling the rings into which the hinges of a door descend, of copper or iron.
Their rims will have a height of about two finger-breadths or so, and the distance between them will be the thickness of a finger, and they will be open at the bottom and open at the top, and they will be fastened to each other in this manner.
Then lower them onto the hip joint, the patient lying on his healthy side, and firmly hold your hand, then pour between the two circles some strong water, which is warmed a little by fire, and hold it for the duration of an hourglass.  The patient will endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the burning subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the strong water from the whole hip with fresh water, then leave it for three days and apply butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and leave it for days while pus flows from it, for that is more effective.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it to hold the water, in the same way as you made for the hip. This is the description of the strong water, and I have described it in the chapter on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part of alkali salt and one part of unslaked lime, crush them, and place them in a new pot which has a small hole pierced in its bottom, just large enough for a probe to enter, and place another glazed pot underneath.
And pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth, after you have pressed them well with your hand, and leave the pot until the strong water descends into the glazed pot below, then collect all that water and pour it onto more fresh lime and alkali.
For then it will be very strong, useful in many medical operations and in cauterizing various members, because it acts exactly like fire.  There are also other drugs which cauterize the hip, such as thapsia, bdellium honey, and lime with soap, ground together.
Galen claimed, recounting it from an ancient man, a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, and greatly magnified its importance, claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures in a single application.
To the point that he might enter the bath carried and leave it cured. This is done by taking green verdigris; if green is not available, take fresh dry verdigris, finely grind it with some fat, and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg, or to the thigh.
It is bound on and left for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside, then he is taken to the bath. When his body is moistened, he is put into the bath; the pain will go away and he will be cured, God willing. If he is not cured, reapply the poultice after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be cured. Know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after evacuating the body. Dioscorides mentioned that if goat hair is used to cauterize sciatica, it is beneficial.
The cautery is done in this manner: wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep place between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat hair.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another and continue doing this until the sensation reaches from the middle of the arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cautery is called goat-hair cautery.
Chapter forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain may occur in the back from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It may be from the effusion of a cold, moist substance. Cauterization is only done in this type alone.
That which is from the effusion of a cold substance, it is necessary, after evacuating the patient with hellebore and the like, to cauterize on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the spot with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be with a pointed cautery.  And if you wish, cauterize it three or four times with a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment often affects small children.  Its initial sign in a child is shortness of breath when standing and moving, and you find at the end of his spinal vertebrae a bead that has emerged, protruding over the other beads.
If you see that and want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this manner. Let the cauterization take hold on each side of the vertebra evenly.  And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another.  Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
And be cautious about using cautery in a hump that is from a spasm of the nerve.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are from cold humors that settle in any member of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, then it is the custom of physicians to call that specifically gout.
If gout caused by cold is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification and the pain does not go away, then cautery will remove it.  This is done by cauterizing around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations after evacuation. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped and moderate, in this manner.
And if you need to puncture the surface of the leg, do so with a pointed cautery iron. If the pain ascends to the knees or to the other joints, which often happens, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.
If you need more cauterization than this, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery; rather, it should be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pain ascends to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned of cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, puncture around the forearms as if circling two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, puncture each joint with a puncture and the metacarpus. If the pain ascends after days to the elbows or shoulders,
cauterize them on each side.  The patient should not lack good management and the taking of medicines, for if he improves his diet and evacuates the phlegm, he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestines and fat descend to the testicle, and this is recent and early, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives that will evacuate his bowels.
Then he should lie on his back in front of you, and you should tell him to restrain himself until the fat or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger. Then you should mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a semicircle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then you heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then you return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then a servant places his hand on the place so that the intestine does not protrude.  And you have spread the patient’s legs apart and placed a pillow underneath, and another servant ties his legs.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then you lower the cautery onto the same mark, and your hand with the cautery should be upright and straight, and you hold it until it reaches the bone, or you repeat it again if it did not reach the bone the first time.
And you should exert yourself to prevent the intestine from protruding while you are cauterizing, lest you burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then you treat the cauterized area after three days with butter until the scab from the fire goes away. Then you treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And you should make his food during his treatment such that it softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during straining and defecation. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, you use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days. And he should reduce exertion, overeating and drinking, and loud crying.
For if this procedure is used in this way, he will recover completely, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.  And as for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is incipient, if you want it not to increase, cauterize a round mark on it according to its size. And let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it. Then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients mentioned that the hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, and make the horizontal line in the upper part of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you place one nail-like cautery in the middle, the first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
In cauterizing the fistula.
If pain occurs in some of the limbs from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time and medication does not alleviate it, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery. The cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization upon it, because it is the nature of these pains to spread from the limb to what is near it.  Therefore, you should pursue them with cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter forty-seven.
In cauterizing leprosy.
As for those with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, observe whether the leprosy is beginning, and if you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not diminished nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will overcome the entire constitution of the patient, then cauterize on the head, five cauterizations. One in the middle of the head, as is customary; the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair; two on the temples; and one at the back on the nape of the neck.  And press your hand with the cautery a little until it slightly affects the bone.
And scales will peel off from it, so that the thick vapors may more easily escape from it.  And cauterize it also on the spleen in the same way as mentioned before.  But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and has appeared clearly, then you should cauterize with these cauterizations which we mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose; two cauterizations on the cheeks; two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck; six on the vertebrae of the back; one large cauterization on the coccyx at the end of the spine; another above it in the same region; and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee; and two on the shoulders; and two on the elbows; and two on the breasts; and cauterize on each joint of the joints of his fingers and toes, one cauterization; and on each heel of his feet and forearms.
And be careful of the nerve which is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them.  And it may be cauterized, one cauterization on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver.  And know that the more cauterizations you do, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of cauterization as much as a healthy person, because his body is numb.  And the cauteries should be of various sizes, large and small, according to the organs and joints, as mentioned before concerning the descriptions of the cauteries.
Then treat the cauterization with finely ground cress mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings, but does not heal, cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb, whether large or small. Let your cauterization be deep, penetrating the thickness of the skin slightly.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  And sometimes cauterization is used for some numbness that appears in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, and the numbness will go away.
And let no one undertake this except one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of vitiligo.
If vitiligo is longstanding and no medical remedy has been effective, then cauterize it slightly deeply, to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour mixed with rose oil,  plantain leaves, and pigeon's blood or partridge blood; one part of each. Mix everything together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the area until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it goes round. Some wise men have mentioned that it should be cauterized intensely in its middle, but I do not see that, because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed that many times.
Therefore, the correct method is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of the fistula.
If a fistula occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the potency of its cause, or because of the patient's age if he is an elderly person with little blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the fistula, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, punctually.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.  If you wish to slow it with cauterization, heat the cautery iron, whose image is this.
And insert it into the middle of the fistula until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the flow of pus is easy. Then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the ulcer.
An ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the member, eating it as fire eats dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, heat many small and large, nail-like cautery irons, according to what suits the place of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption are removed.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthy without corruption, otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.  And the ulcer may be treated with a sharp medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have mentioned its treatment with the sharp medicine in the section; take it from there when you need it.
Chapter fifty-three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition frequently occurs in the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the man, and its cauterization is in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with sharp water.
As for cauterization with fire, it is that you heat a hollow cautery resembling an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it surrounds the nail from every side, and let it be thin-edged, then you lower it, hot, onto the nail, then you rotate your hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it three days, it will suppurate with pus, then you apply a dressing of wild bread, pounded with salt, and leave the dressing on it overnight, then it will be removed from its roots, then you treat the site of the wound with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
And it frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; so you should take a tube of copper or iron or of an eagle's feather and lower it onto the nail or wart, then you pour into the tube a small amount of sharp water.
And hold your hand as you rotate it, with a slight twitch of your hand, so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the sharp water finds a way to penetrate to the root of the nail, and let the patient endure a little the stinging of the sharp water for a while.
Then you leave it, and the nail will be removed from its roots; thus you do it one by one until you come to all of them in the body, then you treat their locations after they are removed with whatever generates flesh from among the ointments.
Chapter fifty-four.
In cauterizing the scab.
If a scab occurs from cold in the nerve or from a quartan fever or something else, then it should be cauterized with four or five cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra a cauterization, and on the chest a cauterization. And on his stomach a cauterization with the olive cautery, for the scab is calmed and the cold illness is hastened to ripen.
Chapter fifty-five.
In cauterizing the pustule occurring in the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt in the body, which are from cold, thick, corrupt materials.  At their first appearance, each pustule should be cauterized gently with a pointed stick whose end has been lit with fire, or with a long root of the ziraund, or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And abscesses may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner; the active cause does not increase, and the illness dissipates and the patient recovers, except that this should be after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
In cauterizing the bleeding that occurs when an artery is cut.
Often, bleeding occurs from an artery that has been severed in a wound that occurs externally, or in the incision of a tumor, or the cauterization of a member, and the like, and its cutting is difficult.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly so that the blood is contained under your finger and nothing comes out of it. Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has burst, and apply the cautery to the same vein after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding starts again and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those in the prepared fire, and continue to do this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that is there, lest another affliction befall the patient. And know that if blood flows from an artery, it cannot be cut, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cautery, as we have said; or by amputation, if it has not already been amputated; for if it is amputated, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or it may be tightly bound with threads; or medications that stop blood flow may be applied to it, and it may be firmly bandaged with compresses.
But whoever tries to cut it with a ligature, or by tightening with rags, or by applying burning substances, and the like, will not stop it at all except rarely. If this happens to someone and a physician or medicine is not at hand, let him quickly place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
and press it very hard until the blood is constricted and flows away from above the wound and onto the artery, and let the finger not be removed from it, constantly applying very cold water until the blood clots and thickens and stops; and meanwhile, look for what is needed of cautery or medicine.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter we mentioned every disease for which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its causes, reasons, instruments, and the forms of cauteries, and we made that into sections from head to foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same method, so that the student may easily find what he seeks.
Before I begin with that, you my sons should know that this chapter contains more dangers than the first chapter on cauterization.
And for that reason, caution should be greater in it, because the work in this chapter often involves the loss of blood upon which life depends when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor or lancing an abscess or treating a wound or removing an arrow or incising a stone, and the like, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.
And I advise you against falling into what is doubtful for you, for there may come to you in this craft various kinds of people with various kinds of illnesses, some of whom are weary of their illness and death is easy for them.
Because of the severity of his illness and the length of his affliction, and the illness has reached a stage indicating death; and some of them will give you their money and enrich you with it in hope of health, and his disease is deadly.  Therefore, you should not assist anyone who comes to you with this condition at all.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of that except after certain knowledge that is established with you of what leads to a good outcome. And use in all treatment of your patients, precedence of knowledge and warning as to what leads to safety.
For in that you have an aid to acquiring praise, glory, mention, and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and not deprive you of correctness and success; indeed, that is in His hand. There is no god but He.
And I have arranged this chapter in sections, as preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from head to foot, to make easier for you what you wish from it, God willing.
The first chapter.
In the treatment of the water which gathers in the heads of children.
This ailment often occurs to infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than infants, and all those whom I have seen of them have quickly died; therefore I have seen [it is best] to leave treatment of it. And I have seen an infant whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day. Until the infant could not sit up by himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or it gathers under the bone on the membrane.  The treatment in this, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that you should make in the middle of the head a single incision across, and the length of the incision should be about two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out.  This is the image of the lancet.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side and the water sinks down if you press it with your hand inwards—and this is not hidden from you—then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
And after the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you bind the incisions with rags and lint, then you bathe it from above with syrup and oil until the fifth day, then you untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments, and do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and feed the patient with every dry food with little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the gathering of water appear, for it may be in the back of the head more, or in its front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then you aim with the incision where the swelling and the fullness of the water appeared to you, so you incise it as you can, and be careful not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the mastoid arteries.
When someone is afflicted with acute catarrh in the eyes or chest, and this has lasted and treatment with medications has not been effective, then the most effective treatment in that is to cut these two arteries.
So, if you want to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then you tighten the patient's neck with the excess of his clothing, then you look where the pulse beats and their positions, the two low-lying positions behind the ears, and they rarely hide except in some people.
Then you mark them with ink, then you cut them with a sharp scalpel, cutting to the bone.  This should be done across the head, or if you wish, you insert the scalpel from under the artery and cut upwards. The length of the cut should be about two fingers’ breadth.
If the artery is cut, the blood will come out in a pulsating flow, leaping forward repeatedly. If the artery is not palpable, you should measure three fingers’ breadth from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
...released from the blood is six ounces on average, and perhaps more or less will be released, all this depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries.  Then look at the wound; if there remains any of the peritoneum on the bone, cut it away.
Lest a hot swelling appear, then bind the wound with a thread of linen rags, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In ligating the two arteries in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic migraine or sudden attacks caused by sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and he is treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried in these diseases ligating the arteries of the temples or cauterizing them as we have described.
The method of ligating them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the artery apparent in the temple should be targeted, for it will be evident to you from its pulsation, and it rarely hides except in a few people.
Or in severe cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and evidently. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it from every side; if the artery is thin, then twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut off a portion of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract, and do not cause bleeding, for if it is not severed and not cut, the blood will not flow at all; then evacuate from six ounces to three of blood.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread, and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest corruption quickly reach it before the wound heals, and bleeding occurs.
Then cut what is between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time. And if you wish to cauterize it with a knife-cautery to the bone until its ends are severed, this will serve the same purpose or better, as we have said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization is something that helps in eliminating humors, and thus it is more certain in its benefit. After removing the arteries, the place should be packed with old cotton and firm bandages applied. After healing, it is treated with dry medicines that grow flesh, and with bandages, until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, hasten to cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the place with vitriol and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If you do not have any of that, put your finger there until the blood clots.
And wash the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and bind it appropriately.  What is easier and simpler than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink.
And lower it, very hot, until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that what is between its ends is separated, for it will not reunite with this cautery at all.  And this is the image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small scalpels, but much less sharp than a scalpel, because if they are as sharp as a scalpel, they cool more quickly and the flesh is not severed quickly. If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire is retained in them.
And the flesh is cut quickly. This method is better than any other, and lighter and easier. Let the distance between the blades be the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the scalp from the outside, and nothing from medical treatment with medication benefits, and you see the patient's face is red. And he feels in his forehead a crawling like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their eyelashes are eroded and their eyelids are clinging from the intensity of the tears.  The ancients in their treatment resorted to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the sword. It is that you order the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision is about two fingers, one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third from the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws.  Let the distance between each incision be about three closed fingers, and have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths to wipe the blood.
Then you insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it you flay all the skin between the two incisions, together with the periosteum on the bone. Then you do this also from the middle incision to the third incision, then you remove this scalpel. And you also insert into the first incision another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other side, and this is its image:
And you place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and you push it until it reaches the middle incision, and you cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then you do that in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood flows, you squeeze the places of the clotted blood, then you place in each incision a pledget of cotton, and you place on it a dressing moistened with syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot inflammation occur, and on the third day you loosen the bandage and use much irrigation with lukewarm water, then you treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and all that you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and catarrh to the eyes from the inside of the head.
When someone experiences many severe, sharp, persistent catarrhs, and you see his eyes weak, small, and his vision weakened, and his eyelids ulcerated, and the eyelashes falling out. And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and catarrhs come from many deep veins, and the best treatment in them is this treatment, which is that you order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and catarrhs come from many deep veins, and the best treatment in them is this treatment, which is that you order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or a little higher horizontally, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples that move when chewing, until the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the lips of the incision with old cotton or a linen thread, then bandage from above with pledgets, and soak the pledgets with syrup and oil, lest a hot swelling occur, and when you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, then you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins in it.
Then treat it with the drying treatment that grows flesh, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and preparing an ointment from them, and using it in the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-stone like iron and glass; or a plant seed like chickpeas and kernels and the like; or a flowing thing like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal.  If a stone or a kind of stone that does not grow in the ear falls into the ear, then expose the ear to the sun. If you see the stone, then instill some violet oil or ceruse into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with a handkerchief. And plug the nostrils when sneezing comes, after placing a ring of cloth or wool around the ear and extending the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment. If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with a gentle probe, whose image is this.
If it comes out with the probe, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blind hook. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole smoothly.
And seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a path for the air other than the tube, then draw it with your breath strongly. Often it comes out with that. If it does not come out with what we described, then take a little of the Nabataean mastic or of the prepared mastic with which birds are caught, and place it on the end of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then insert it gently into the ear hole after drying the ear of moisture. If it does not come out by all that we have described, then proceed to incision before a hot inflammation or a convulsion occurs.
The method of incision is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein and remove blood from him according to his strength. Then you seat the patient before you and turn his ear upwards and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe in its lower part.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then sew up the incision quickly and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it as we mentioned. If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, delicate scalpel of this shape.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear.  You only do this if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear so that it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe, or with a soft sponge, or by suction.
As we mentioned, then it is easy to remove them.  As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear containing the water. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many smooth, flat pebbles the length of the fingers, warm them slightly by fire, and the patient inserts one into the opening of his ear, and he hops on one leg on that side, and strikes the pebble in the ear with another pebble.
He continues to do this with pebble after pebble until all the water comes out. The water may also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and applying the other end to fire until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out, or draw it out with the tube as was mentioned previously for the pebble. As for removing an animal that has entered, see if it is small in size like a flea, etc. then treat it as was mentioned in the section, and as for...
if its body is large enough to be felt, then try to remove it with forceps and hooks, and this is easier than anything that becomes lodged in the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you treat it with what we mentioned in the section on fumigations and your treatment is not effective,
you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see anything of the worms, remove them with forceps or fine hooks. If you do not see anything, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly. Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If they do not respond to being pulled out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you with the pebble.
If they do not come out with what we have mentioned, use the fumigations which I mentioned and which the ancients have used to kill worms. You will find this in the section on fumigations.  Pouring oils and medicines into the ear is done with this instrument, and this is its image:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. And if you wish, let the nozzle inside the tube be of tightly fitting copper.  And if you wish, take a reed and tightly wrap cotton around its end.
Then pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the cavity of the ear and it is felt.
The patient feels it going in. And let what you pour into the ear be warmed a little in the fire, and beware that what is dripped into it is neither too cold nor too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of obstruction occurring in the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear openings not perforated.
Obstruction in the ear canal may also occur in some people due to a wound or newly grown flesh. This obstruction may be deep within the ear opening, invisible to the eye.
It may also appear slightly outside the opening and be visible. That which occurs deep within the ear and is invisible is, in most cases, difficult to cure. That which is visible should have the patient's ear exposed to the sun. And look into it; if you see the obstruction is visible, open it with a delicate scalpel, which is of this form:
Its tip should be slightly wide, its edges somewhat limited, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently but firmly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, slender probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction and the patient experiences hearing difficulty, remove it gently.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum. Then insert into the ear a wick, to fit the size of the opening, smeared with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the healing of the wound is ensured. Or take a wick, moisten it with water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
Use this. If you see that the ear is swollen with a hot inflammation, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another wick smeared with a plaster made with rose oil, until the hot inflammation subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on cauterizations.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  It is necessary to grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a mild lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization is preferable after cutting.  It often recurs if any of its roots remain; if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and it does not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness often appears in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, which is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The procedure is as follows: If the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves in every direction, then it is easy to treat; make a transverse incision.
Then gently peel it from all sides until it is removed, then hang it with a hook and cut it off. If you cannot cut it off until it penetrates the eyelid, this will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, join it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm, for the ointment will heal and join it. If the cold is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and hang the cold with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it off from all sides.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that does no harm. Then wash the eye after removing the cold with salt water and treat the area with what joins it until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the stye which appears in the eyelid.
A stye is a lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and this mostly occurs in children. It weighs down their eyes, and they experience colds in the mornings, and are unable to look at the sunlight. Because the tears rush to them.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and on them they sleep, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, with swelling upon them, and the stye is clearly visible. When you press the place with your fingers, you feel the stye between them. The procedure is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it, and you make a circle from that wick to the extent that it surrounds the stye from every side, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from every side to collect the stye in the middle of the circle.
Then you make an incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, a transverse incision, and the incision should not be larger than the incision that is made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should incise all the skin until you reach the stye.
Then, in most cases, the stye protrudes from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat. You pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers, while you turn your hand to the right and left until it heals. And beware of increasing the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and harm it.
If the stye does not appear to you in the first incision, then you should increase the incision a little gently until the stye appears, then you pull it out as we said, then you dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the place and bind it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
And they place it in the hollow of the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of styes of the eye.
If there grow on the eyelid extra membranes, other than the natural course, under the natural membranes and eyelashes, then they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness, and thickening, until it becomes a cause of blindness in the eye.
And the stye of the eye is of four types: either by cauterization with fire, or by a caustic medicine as was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the stye may be by cutting and suturing, or by a reed, as I shall mention.
It is necessary that you place the head of the patient in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it turns over, otherwise, insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, and that should be near the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
And turn it over with a probe, then incise in the inner part of the eyelid without the superfluous hair with a sharp scalpel from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, then remove the thread and place under the eyelid a small pledget of cotton or cloth, then mark on the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of an ivy leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because people differ in this; some need you to cut from the eyelid an amount suitable to the degree to which the eyelid has relaxed.
And some need less cutting; all that is according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the scalpel on the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and let each incision be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin, then flay it all, then gather with stitching the lips with a needle and thin woolen thread, and wipe away the blood, and stick what remains of the threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter. Then leave the stitching and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without stitching and treat it with what dries and constricts, for the eyelid rises when the wound closes and unites, and stitching is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, except that it is burdensome for the patient; it is a good operation and there is no danger in it. Another method of blepharoplasty is also to mark on the eyelid a shape like the shape of an ivy leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting evenly.
If you cannot hold the hooks and they do not straighten for you, then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus, and gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then lift it with your hand with a moderate lift.
Lift the marked skin completely as we described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot inflammation occurs when you cut or incise, then soothe that inflammation with qirūṭī and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its margins inverted; in this case you should use what we have mentioned of cutting, suturing and cauterization with fire or with a caustic medicine; cauterization with fire or with a caustic medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing, and do cutting and suturing in both.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this way: you invert the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you have carved notches at their ends on both sides where the threads are fastened, then you gently gather them over what remains of the eyelid and tightly pull the two reeds from both sides and leave it for some days; the stretched skin dies, blackens and decays.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow, cut it with scissors, then treat it until it heals.  When it heals, the eyelid rises and the margins of the eye do not invert. This is an image of the two reeds, make them in this shape and this size in length and width exactly:
Chapter Twelve.
On raising ingrown eyelashes from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle and thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread, then gather its ends and tie a very gentle knot, and let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach another thin thread to the needle, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clear, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the ingrown hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then pull the thread upward with the needle and draw into the needle that hair, whether it be one, two, or three, but no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the needle in the eyelid along with the natural hair.  If you pull the needle and the hair does not come out with it, pull the needle downwards with the thread you attached to it until the needle comes out of the upper opening.
Then return the hair into it and pull them; do this until it rises into the upper opening and you see it clearly. Then remove the needle and the thread and take them out, and bind the eyelid and leave it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair from the natural hair so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while; then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the sty that occurs in the upper eyelid.
That which this sty is exposed to is called a harelip, and this sty is either natural or accidental. The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or a cut or cauterization and the like.
And the method of treating it is to incise that adhesion and separate its lips, and place a linen wick between them and bind it until it heals.  And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the sty will return worse than it was. Rather, use in it things that relax, such as fenugreek and lint with water in which althaea and flaxseed have been boiled, and a diachylon ointment melted with some fats, and smear it with the wick and treat it with that.
And the key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it not adhere in the way it was initially. And this treatment that we have mentioned is only some repair of the sty, not that the appearance of the place returns to exactly as it was at all.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of the sty which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This sty which occurs in the lower eyelid is that which is truly called a sty, and it is natural and it is accidental.  The accidental one is from a wound or incision or cauterization and the like.
And the method of working in it is that you take a needle with doubled thread and pierce it into the flesh and pass it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at the two ends of the flesh, then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
Then if the shape of the eyelid returns to what it should be, otherwise you take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two incisions are from the corners of the cut which you cut until they meet, so that an angle is formed from them. Until, when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
Which is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is lower than what is below the eyelid, then you gather the separated parts with two stitches, sewing it with a woolen thread, then you treat it with what we mentioned of emollient medicines and bandages until it heals.
And if the fistula appeared from an incision or suture or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without the hair of the labia as well, as mentioned before, then separate the lips with a bandage as we mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of fistula, whether from above or below, you should act according to what is possible for you in terms of the appearance of the fistula, for it may differ greatly in form, and the skillful surgeon devises a means in whatever way he can.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it, and the disease itself indicates the appropriate treatment and instrument in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  It is necessary to insert the point of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel, not sharply like cutting scalpels, but rather slightly blunt, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slips, injuring the eye with its sharpness.  Your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, then pour salt water into the eye to wash it, or instill a solution of vitriol in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen wick.
And place on top of the eye wool moistened with egg white. After the third day, use collyria with acacia until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the excision of pterygium and the fleshy excrescences of the conjunctiva.
Pterygium is of two kinds: either nervous, resembling a thin, hard membrane; or non-nervous, resembling a thick, white moisture which, if touched with an iron instrument or attempted to be grasped with a hook, will tear.
And a hook cannot be fixed in it. Both kinds begin from the greater canthus until they gradually spread until they cover the pupil and obstruct vision and the movement of the eye. The method of excising them is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards, then you take a needle and thread it with a horsehair or oxhair and strong thread, and you bend the point of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
And you pass the needle through and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium next to the pupil, as if you were dissecting it with the hair to its end, then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a sharp scalpel or small scissors, and you leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
So that constant lacrimation does not result from its excision.  The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then the smooth scalpel dissects the end, the picture of which is this:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a perforation and injure the pupil. Then after the excision, put something of powdered salt or zinc sulfate in the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not vascular and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook to it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medication and heals as described in the classification.  If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, like this image: And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it is loosening and breaking up and the dissection is affecting it, then instill in the eye from your instrument zinc sulfate or red sulfate or powdered salt, and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then resume working on it until it is all gone, unless a hot inflammation hinders you in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume working on it by dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the caruncle…
If the excrescence harms the eye excessively, then hook that excrescence with a hook and cut some of it off, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause tearing, then instill in the caruncle red sulfate or zinc sulfate until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the pterygium and what grows of excess flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, red flesh may grow, accumulating until it covers the pupil or comes close to it or overflows onto the eyelids; and perhaps the eyelids are turned outward, and it resembles a wild rose.
The procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you grasp all that red flesh with hooks suitable for that.
Or you grasp it with a rasp or forceps, then you cut the flesh, piece by piece, until you remove all of it by cutting, and you protect the eye so as not to harm it during the procedure.  Your cutting may be with the scalpel that we described in cutting the pterygium, or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks hairs, as its image comes in the chapter following this chapter.
When your cutting is completed and all the growth is gone, fill the eye with crushed salt or drop into it some red vitriol or a similar caustic medicine, and apply to the eye externally a cotton pledget with egg white to prevent hot inflammation.
If some of the growth remains and the bleeding overcomes you and you fear hot inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with what calms the inflammation, then return to the procedure until it heals.  Do likewise with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
Except that it is necessary for you to avoid treating any eye weak by nature or by circumstance with the iron. And do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the member is able to withstand that procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On removing pterygia from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels which grow over the eye, preventing its function and weakening the eye over time.  First you should look; if the eye in which the pterygia is found is strong and has no other disease besides the pterygia,
then removal is performed as follows: you should tell the patient to place his head in your lap, then you should hook those vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill.  The hooks should be delicately curved in this manner:
Or they may be two hooks joined together in one piece, in this manner:
Then, with a delicate pair of scissors, gently remove those vessels, wiping away the blood from time to time, until you see that the eye is free of those vessels and the bleeding has stopped. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done in the middle of the day, facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work, so that you do not cut anything other than those vessels.  When you have finished, instill green or red vitriol into the eye, so that its sharpness may consume what remains of the pterygia. If you cannot remove it all at that time, then bandage the eye with something that soothes the pain of the eye.
And leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is safe, then repeat the procedure in the same way until it is healed. This is the picture of the appropriate scissors.
And leave it [and let the patient's head be in the lap of the pupil, and another wipes away the tears and checks the flow of tears in the front and back of the eye, and you] the principle in this operation is that you open the eye with fixed or triangular openers that the pupil holds.
Sharp, and let the patient's head be in the lap of the pupil, and another wipes away the tears and checks the flow of tears in the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice of beginning to remove it from the top of the eye or from the bottom. It is best to remove two strands on the upper side, one at the end of the cornea and the other at the beginning.
And grasp them between the middle finger and the index finger, then hook them from below opposite them, then grasp them between the little finger and the ring finger, and lift your hand gently until you see all of the pterygium raised. Then cut it from the smaller side, if you wish, with scissors, or if you wish, with a delicate scalpel.
And insert the thread onto a needle and lift all the pterygium until it is raised on the conjunctiva, and do not cut the thread, for the tears and blood will make it difficult for you.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the cornea from above and below so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea.  If you can lift it from the cornea by pulling the thread, that is best, and it may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, let its place be cauterized for several days to soothe its pain and prevent hot swelling, then resume the treatment.
Chapter Nineteen.
On returning the nose to its place.
Physicians call a nasal polyp a fistula. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication as previously described, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy except to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
The rasp, which is made of Indian iron, is called the head. Its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or a rasp. You place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, applying slight pressure with your hand until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this repeatedly, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medications. If the wound closes and flesh grows in it, and the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, suppuration, or any incident,
know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to return the fistula to the nasal cavity in this manner:  again expose the bone with an iron instrument or a sharp medication. When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering to the tip, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid and a little further from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
He will feel air escaping from it if he holds his hand over his nose. Then dress the wound with the drying astringent medications as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter which used to flow outwards will return to the nose; this will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On returning the protrusion of the eye.
If the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no damage or impairment occurs in the vision, then you should ease the patient, and then bleed him in the cephalic vein.  Then apply a cupping glass to the nape of the neck without restriction, and gently suck.
Then apply a poultice made from acacia, aloes, frankincense, and bdellium. Then bind the eye firmly over the poultice with many pledgets. The method of making the pledgets is to take many soft lint, and fold each piece into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one over the other, as much as the eye needs. Then bind it firmly with a strong cloth. Repeat the cupping with gentle suction, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened gently. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise, repeat the poultice, pledgets, binding, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter twenty-one.
On cutting the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvular layer, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is that you insert a needle into the base of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the palate, and pass it through, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it firmly, then you remove the needle and place on the eye wool moistened with egg white and leave it until the threads fall off with the uvula, then you treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  You may pull the uvula from each side with a circle of cloth until the eye is further drawn in firmly, then incise with a fine scalpel reaching to the depth of the eye so that the white moisture flows, and the eye descends and withers in place, then you pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of the uvula.
This ailment, which is called kamanah, is a moisture that collects in the eye resembling descending water, but it is not. The method of treatment is that you seat the patient on a chair upright, then take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the moisture descend to the bottom with your eye, then it stabilizes and does not move, and the light departs and the patient sees things as he used to see them. And if it does not descend to the bottom, we know that it is water.  If the descent of the moisture does not occur as mentioned,
then seat the patient between your hands, then take a thin scalpel and incise it slightly above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the ciliary region until the substance comes out.
Then, once it has come out, instill in the eye warm water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for cupping, in a detailed and explained statement, so take it from there correctly. Then you should seat the patient between your hands, sitting cross-legged facing the light near the sun.
And you should bind his healthy eye and tie it tightly, then lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye with the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of a probe, in the same white of the eye on the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the depth to which the cupping instrument goes is the distance from the pupil to the end of the blackness which is the cornea, for the copper will be seen by the examiner himself directly due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cupping instrument upwards to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards again and again, and if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his sight has been opened to immediately with the cupping instrument in his eye, then it will rest a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
If it settles and does not rise, then remove the cupping instrument gently while twisting it with your hand little by little, then dissolve in the water a little clean Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then apply to the outside of the whole eye a compress or wet wool.
with rose oil and egg white and you bandage it along with the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the cupping instrument does not succeed in entering the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes, Then you should take the scalpel called the *barīd*, whose image is this:
Then pierce only the adherent part with it and do not overdo the piercing, but it is only to make a delicate place for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as we have mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm lying-down place where he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food that which softens his nature, and he does not move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
Show him things, then replace the bandage until the seventh day.  It is not appropriate to do this during treatment or after cupping at your hour, but you should avoid that before the water ascends quickly with intense vision.
If a hot swelling appears, then you should untie the eye before the seventh day and treat that with what calms the swelling, until when it is calmed, then at that time you release his sight and place a veil on his face, training his sight from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then...
He gradually leaves the house and manages his affairs. And know that in cupping, the learner cannot dispense with observation many times, then he proceeds to the work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a cupping instrument that is drawn out, with which he sucks out the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor read it in any book of the ancients. It may be that this is recent. And this is an image of types of cupping instruments for those who are ignorant of them:
It is made especially of copper, and its end is of this very thinness, triangular-ended and sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of fleshy growths in the nose.
Various fleshy growths may grow in the nose, some resembling a centipede, some being cancerous flesh, hardened and dark in color, and some being soft flesh, not dark in color.
If any of these fleshy growths are soft, not malignant nor cancerous, then you should seat the patient before you facing the sun, open his nostril, and cast the snare into that flesh, then pull it outwards, and then cut what it has grasped with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone. If any remains that you could not cut, then remove it with one of the delicate instruments gently, so that nothing remains. If the bleeding overcomes you or a hot inflammation appears,
then treat it appropriately. If it is one of the malignant tumors, then act quickly to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone, then place in the nose after cutting, vinegar and water or a drink. If the nose opens and moisture passes from it to the throat,
know that he is healed. If the moisture does not pass as it should, then know that inside there is flesh growing on the top of the porous bones that the instrument did not reach with the cutting. Then it is necessary that you take a linen thread of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, and make between each knot the space of a finger or less.  Let the patient skillfully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever is possible for him, after making it like a button, and draw his breath until it reaches the pharynx.
and it comes out at his throat.  Children often do this in school, and it is easy for those who want to do it. Then gather the ends of the thread, the one end that came out at the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing so until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread and put in the nose, after wiping away the blood, a wick that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh. Then, as a last thing, put a lead tube in the nose for days until it heals. If it needs a drying treatment, use that.
And this is the image of the syringe with which ointments and medicines are dropped into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small, open oil lamp, and its tube as well.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the nozzle of the syringe flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat the ointment or whatever you want of juices or flowing things in it.
Chapter twenty-five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Often a wart grows on the tip of the nose, and it increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, you should cut it off at its first appearance and excise all of it, then apply to the place either cautery or a burning medicine which takes the place of cautery. If you miss cutting it until it becomes large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark-colored, and insensitive.
Then do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer a great calamity from it. But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that excision is possible in its entirety. Then let the patient vomit and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the place with what dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or the like, know that when a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, rarely does treatment work except in some people.
Then, if any of this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with its blood; gather the edges of the wound with sutures, then treat it until it heals. And if the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part is whole, then it is necessary to scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then gather the edges with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered, and place on top a plaster of palm-tree ointment or another of the agglutinative ointments, and leave it tied for two or three days, then untie it.
And change the medication and leave it until the threads separate by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to gather the separated connection, either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as we showed you there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots which appear in the lips.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble a barleycorn, others are smaller or larger. You should turn back the lip and incise each nodule and hang it with a hook.
And cut it from each side, then pack the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt and treat the area with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting away excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis. You should hook it with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base, and let the serum or blood flow, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does return—cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On extracting teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly crusts may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  These may blacken, yellow, or green, so that the decay reaches the gums and disfigures the teeth.
The patient should sit before you with his head in your lap.  Clean the tooth or teeth where you see the crusts and the gritty substance until nothing remains.  Do likewise with the black, green, and yellow discolorations and anything else, until you have cleaned it.
If the crusts are removed at the first cleaning, well and good. Otherwise, repeat the cleaning on another day, and then again, and again until you achieve your goal. Know that a tooth may require many different shapes of instruments, according to what is suitable for the task.
For the instrument used to clean the inside of a tooth is not the same as that used for the outside, nor that used between the teeth, which is of yet another form.  These are several forms of instruments, all of which you should have ready:
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat a toothache by every means possible and delay extraction, for there is no replacement for a tooth once it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, unless extraction is absolutely necessary.
If the patient is determined to have it extracted, you should ascertain that the pain is in the tooth itself. For often the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in a sound tooth, and extracts it, then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
If you ascertain that the pain is in that tooth itself, then you should incise around the tooth with a strong scalpel, so as to loosen the gum on all sides, then move it slightly with your fingers or with delicate forceps, little by little, until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and hold the patient's head between your knees, having steadied him so that he does not move; then pull the tooth straight out, so as not to break it. If it does not come out otherwise, take one of those instruments and gently insert it under the tooth from all sides, and proceed to move it as before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the hole with a rag and pack it tightly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull on it with the forceps; and you should thoroughly incise around the gum on every side.
And take care lest you break it, so that part of it remains, and the patient suffers a worse affliction than his initial pain. And beware of doing what the ignorant barbers do, in their haste and boldness in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or else it may extract some of the bone of the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.  Then, after its extraction, let him rinse his mouth with a drink or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the place—and this often happens—then crush some vitriol and pack the place with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the vitriol does not help. The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth: they should be long-pronged, short-handled, and thick, lest they bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be thick-handled, as you see, so that when you grasp them they do not yield nor bend; short-pronged. And let them be of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, with sharpened points, and at their tips, teeth that interlock, so that they grasp firmly and tightly.
And the points may be made like a file, so that they also hold strongly.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On extracting the roots of molars and removing fractured jawbones.
If, when extracting a molar, a root remains broken off, you should apply a cotton pledget with fat to the area for a day or two, until the area relaxes, then introduce the forceps or hooks. whose points resemble the beak of the bird called the “bulrāja,” and this is an image of the hooks:
They should be made like a file on the inside or like a rasp. If you are not able to extract it with these hooks, you should drill into the root and expose all the flesh with the scalpel, then introduce the instrument resembling a small lever, which is depicted thus:
short at the end, somewhat thick, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root is extracted by this, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted thus: the first has a triangular point, somewhat thick:
Another fine triangular image:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, which is also depicted thus:
And other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of teeth.  We may also use this instrument which resembles a large hook, which is depicted thus:
Triangular, with a curved point, somewhat thick, lest it break; and it should not be pointed. Know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, and so are all the other instruments; they are almost innumerable.  A skillful and expert craftsman may invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variety of their types. If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then search for it in its place with one of these instruments and hooks which were mentioned in the extraction of roots.
And we use a forceps, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to hold the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed. And we treat the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone has a little decay, cleanse it of its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the extraction of molars growing on top of others.
If molars grow other than in their natural course, it is unsightly, especially if this happens in women and slaves.  It should be examined; if the molar has grown behind another tooth,
and its extraction or pushing back is impossible, then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron, very sharp at the tip. Your cutting should be done over many days because of the tooth's hardness, so as not to shake other teeth. But if it is firmly grown, so you can file it down, then file it down with a file from India, whose image is this.
It should be entirely of Indian [steel], and its point should be very finely engraved, like the file with which needles are made. File the tooth down little by little over many days gently, so as not to shake the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then smooth it down further and remove it with some forceps.
And if a tooth is broken, and it hurts the tongue when speaking, then it should also be filed down until the roughness of that fracture is gone, and it becomes even and smooth, and does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loosened and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything edible for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medications but the treatment has not worked.
The solution is to tie them with a gold or silver thread; gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever, and this does not happen to it. The thread should be of moderate fineness and thickness, according to what fits between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then weave back to the side where you began, and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all.  Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose, then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them, twist them with the pliers, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Then leave it tied as it is for as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, tie it again with another thread.  In this way, he will enjoy it for his whole life. This is an image of the teeth and how the binding is done to two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see:
A single tooth or two may be returned to their place after falling out, and bound as we have described, and they will remain. This is done by a skilled craftsman. He may carve a bone from cattle bone and shape it like a tooth, and place it in the place from which the tooth has gone. And it is tightened as we have said, and it remains, and he enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has healed.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint. If there is some stiffness and complexity, and this is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is loosened.
And beware that the incision is not deep into the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then, after the cutting, let him gargle with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of linen which the patient holds in place each night.
Lest it unite again.  If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the place. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery suitable for this. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On removing a frog generated under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and it may even grow large enough to fill the mouth. The procedure is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun and look at the tumor.
If you see it dark-colored or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer. But if it is whitish and moist, insert a hook into it and dissect it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from all sides.
If bleeding overwhelms you during the procedure, apply powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops, then resume your work until you remove it completely. Then, let the patient rinse the mouth with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors; there may appear inside the throat glands resembling those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what was mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
then look: if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not approach it with an instrument. And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not approach it with an instrument either, for fear of bleeding; rather, leave it until it matures, then either you will lance it or it will break open of its own accord.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided or lessened somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth; and take an assistant with you who presses his tongue downwards with an instrument of this shape:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue down with it and the tumor becomes visible to you, take a hook and pierce it into the tonsil and pull it outwards as much as possible, without pulling anything of the membranes along with it.
Then cut it with an instrument of this shape: it resembles scissors, except that its two ends are curved, and each of them is very sharp at its edge next to the other; it is made of Indian iron or Damascene steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this shape:
sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled, until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals. Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut them as described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, which almost blocked her throat. The woman breathed through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death if she remained one or two days. Two branches extended from the tumor, reaching her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled; a suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it; only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat. We continued to cut away parts of the tumor repeatedly for a long time, the tumor replacing what was cut, until it was prolonged for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat. It stopped growing, then she traveled away, and I did not know what God did with her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-Seven
On cutting a uvular tumor.
That which is called ‘anba’ if it descends as a growth to the uvula and swells, and is white and oblong; it is called ‘‘amud’ if it is thick below and round, it is called ‘anba’. If it is treated with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective,
and I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from it and it was thin; then it should be cut, and what is gathered together and round, and does not have length, and is bloody or the color of pus, or black, or without sensation, then it should be avoided cutting.
For there is danger to the patient. Therefore, if you see it in the manner that I described, of its whiteness and length, then seat the patient facing the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument whose description I presented earlier, then pierce the ‘anba’ with the hook.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.  And it is necessary that you cut only that which exceeds the natural state without excess, for if you cut more of it you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of its being cut, then it is necessary to use a method of cauterizing it without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, and that is that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned, then take of the sharp water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it, and this is its image:
Its end, in which you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat so that nothing descends from it into his throat to harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you press it against the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the stinging of the medicine has ceased. And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe and wet the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until you stick the cotton to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula. Then leave it; it will wither and fall after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and wipe away the medicine around it. Then gargle with cold water and treat from the outside with lotions and from the inside with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this way: take futhanga, zofu, savory, sedab, wormwood, chamomile, qisum, and similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Boil it, the pot being plastered with wise mud, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid onto which a hollow instrument is fitted, made in this way, of silver or copper.
Insert the end containing the pomegranate into the patient's mouth until the steam rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well compressed. Then repeat it several times until it withers. And beware of performing this treatment at the first occurrence of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Rather, it should be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an eggshell to its end, lest the patient's mouth be burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is among the good treatments, with its safety.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a fish bone or thorn or something else lodges in the throat.  Then you should remove what is visible to the eye, after compressing the tongue with the instrument, at the time of the sun.
So that what is in the throat becomes clear to you. And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, then it is necessary that you induce vomiting in the patient before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit; or the patient may swallow a piece of turnip or the root of a lettuce.
Or he may swallow a piece of dry bread, or you may take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a string, then he swallows it; and when it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly. Do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and be removed. If it is not removed by what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a probe, and at its end a hook. The patient inserts it into his throat gently, raising his head upwards, and being careful not to touch his throat lest it cause coughing, and pushes the bone or thorn with it; or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And the patient's insertion of it is better, because he knows the position of the lodged object, and pushes downwards or pulls upwards with the instrument, all this as much as he is able, until it comes out.
Chapter thirty-nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on treatment with medication, and it is not effective, then look then into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
If your sight falls upon the leech, then draw it out with a small hook or with a fine, tightly-made forceps; and if you are not able to do so otherwise, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near to the leech, then insert into the hollow of the tube a piece of iron heated in the fire.
Do this repeatedly, and let the patient abstain from water all that day; then let him take a vessel full of cold water and open his mouth into it and gargle with it, and let him not swallow a drop of it, and let him move the water from time to time with his hand.
Then the leech will fall to the bottom if it feels the water; and if it does not come out by what we have described, then fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida with the instrument which was described in the fumigation of the tonsils; do this repeatedly, for it will fall.
The method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot containing embers heated in the fire, and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole; then you fit into that hole the end of the instrument, then you throw in the fumigant, and the patient puts his mouth to the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the fumigant does not escape until he knows that the fumigant has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall to the bottom; and if it does not fall, then let the fumigation be repeated, and let the patient endure thirst and eat salty things and garlic, and let him not drink water; then it must come out by this treatment. And this is a picture of an instrument by which the leech is drawn from the throat if it is seen.
And it resembles hooks, as you see, except that it has this curvature which enters the throat, and its ends resemble the mouth of a bird; in them is the roughness of a file, so if it seizes anything it does not leave it.
And another instrument, with which the tongue is pressed down; it is a wide ring of iron, as much as the mouth can contain above the tongue; it is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so that the mouth remains open without the will of the patient, and he cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
The description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this very way.
Chapter Forty.
It will then speak of cauterizing tumors and incising them.
Tumors are numerous and varied in kind, as will be mentioned one by one in this book; they differ in their cauterization and incision in two respects: one, the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
The second type is because of the locations in which they occur in the body, for a tumor occurring in the head is not the same as a tumor occurring in the rectum, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy location is not the same as a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own rule of treatment.
Some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and become complete, and some should be cauterized while they are raw and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are near the joints.
For if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it corrupts what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, and this may cause paralysis of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that vital organ; or it may be near the rectum, so cauterize it raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a raw tumor that is not fully mature which is near the rectum, lest it corrupt the depths and penetrate into the rectum and become a fistula.
And it becomes something that does not heal.  You should know the time to cauterize tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor becomes pitted, and all the other signs [are present].
The cauterization should be applied to the lowest possible part of the tumor if that is possible, so that the flow of matter is easier downwards, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor. The cauterization should follow the length of the body if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the places of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in short, in all flat places that do not bend.  As for those that bend, the cauterization should follow the contour of that place. As for tumors in fleshy places, it is best to leave them uncauterized.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said, for if you cauterize it before that, the flow of pus from it will be prolonged, and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its lips and depths will harden. Some tumors may be cauterized across the body when necessary, or according to the needs of the affected area.
In small tumors, one cauterization should be used; in large tumors, a wide cauterization or many incisions should be made, according to the size of the tumor.  Some tumors may need to have the skin scraped and cut if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached the point where it has died, as happens in many abscesses and hidden collections. Some of them are incised with a three-sided incision, and some are cut in the shape of an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
Some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions.  If it does not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, it should only be cauterized simply. If the tumor is large, has been present for a long time, and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at once.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until the next day, then remove some more pus; do this repeatedly gradually until you have removed all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, and the patient may die without your noticing. Therefore, be extremely cautious in this matter.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small, or the incision is simple, use lint or old cotton for packing. If the tumor is large and the cauterization incisions are numerous,
you should insert a tenton into each incision until they meet. If some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or eroded, you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture, and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during the procedure, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it repeatedly to the bleeding area.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the methods and treatments and styptics that we have described in many places in this book and in the treatise. If it is winter and the tumor is in a highly nervous area, you should moisten the bandages with a warm potion and oil.
Apply them to the area. If it is summer and the area is fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in cold water and oil, or in a cold potion and oil.  Then, as we said, on the third day you should unwrap the tumor and wipe it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have described the treatment of each tumor individually, summarized and categorized.
Chapter Forty-One.
On the incision of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp; they are a type of boil contained within membranes, similar in appearance to a chicken's pouch.  There are many types, some fatty, and some containing a moisture resembling mud.
And some contain a moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on, and some are hardened and solid.  There is no danger in incising and removing all of them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for their incision is to first probe them with the instrument whose image follows, which is called the 'muddass', so that you know what they contain. If what they contain is moisture, then incise them lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line B to line C. When the moisture has drained, dissect and remove the entire sac that contained that moisture, leaving absolutely nothing behind, for it often returns if anything remains.
Then, soak a cotton swab in yellow ointment if available, otherwise in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, for it will consume what remains of the sac. Then, apply the cotton swab with the yellow ointment again and again, if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. And if the swelling contains fatty material, incise it in this manner:
Make a firm incision and place hooks in the edges of the wound.  Dissect it from every side and do your best to remove the membrane containing it. If an artery obstructs you, do as I have described for you, and do likewise for the swelling if it is hardened by the incision.
The treatment is the same as I have described. The incision on a hardened swelling is easier because it contains little blood and moisture.  Some of these swellings in the head in some people contain absolutely no moisture at all.  And so I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone, impossible to break; and if someone threw it, it would cut him.  And it was not like other swellings occurring in the head, except for those that appear in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make their bottom from their lower parts so that the flow of matter to the bottom is easier; then treat them with whatever treatment suits them.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which often appear in the neck. These swellings often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins; and they may appear in the rest of the body. That which appears in the neck may be one or many, and some develop from others.
And each swelling of them is within a special sac, as is the case in boils and the swellings of the head as we have described. And the types of these swellings are many: some are calcified, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
So I saw one of them in good condition to the touch, and its appearance was close to the color of the skin; it moved in every direction and was not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor was it deep-seated. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from above to below the body, in this manner, from line J to line B.
And you should dissect it from every side and stretch the edges of the skin with a hook or two hooks or many hooks if you need that, as we said in the swellings of the head.  Remove it little by little and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and let the scalpel not be very sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting or the patient be disturbed, and you cut what you do not need to cut. If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, then place in the wound powdered verdigris or some of the styptics that stop blood.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the acuteness of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will then stop. Then return to your work until you finish, then examine with your index finger if there are any other small tumors remaining, so cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the tumor, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a double, tight thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the tumor completely, then you should bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately after you ascertain that no residue remains. If you see that some residue of the bone of the tumor remains,
then you should aim to cut to its root and base and use stitching and what we have mentioned. And as for tumors containing fluids, lance them simply where their ripening appears, and make the incision from below as we said.
Then, after lancing, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume what remains of the corruption, until when you see that the wound has been cleansed, treat it with ointments that promote granulation until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
Concerning the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with angina, they should avoid the incision of the throat, since they will not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be diseased. But those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the windpipe, then it is necessary to use the incision of the throat to escape the harm which results from suffocation.
Then, if we want to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the windpipe, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it. If the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the windpipe, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the membrane that we described.  The incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it along with what is excised, and by the interruption of the voice. The wound is left open for a time. Then, when the time in which suffocation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are brought together from the skin.
And its outline alone, without the cartilage. Then use medications which cause the growth of flesh until it heals. The author of this book said: The explanation of this statement which we have mentioned is only if they see the patient's throat obstructed by one of these tumors which were mentioned.
And the patient was close to death and his life was about to end. They proceeded to incise the throat so that the patient might breathe somewhat at the site of the wound and be saved from death.  They were ordered to leave the wound open until the intensity of the illness subsides, and its intensity is about three days or so.
Then they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and passed it across her throat, cutting some of the lung windpipe. I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening as a slaughtered animal weakens. So I uncovered the wound.
Then I found the blood which came out of the wound to be slight, and I was certain that she had not cut a vein nor a jugular vein. Air was exiting from the wound. I immediately outlined the wound and treated it until it healed.  Nothing happened to the maidservant except a slight hoarseness in the voice, nothing more.
And after days she returned to her best condition. From this, we say that incising the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision of the tumor which appears in the throat from the outside and is called the throat elephantiasis.
This tumor, which is called throat elephantiasis, is a large tumor of the color of the body. It is frequent in women and is of two types.
Either it is natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, and the other resembling the tumor which results from the complication of an artery; and in its incision there is danger. Therefore, one should not at all apply iron to it, except what is small of it; if you examine and investigate it with a probe and find it to resemble a fatty swelling, and it is not attached to anything of the veins, then incise it as you incise fatty swellings. And remove it with its containing sac, if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it, then treat the place with what is appropriate of treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
On the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in their types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult.  So I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and severe pain until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the suppuration is completed; then the fever and intensity subside.  A swelling is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain, and it is contained in a membranous sac, which is a special covering for it. It is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a blister, larger or smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I have mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you come to treat a swelling, you should first probe and examine it with the instrument called the *muddass*, whose image is given in the chapter which follows this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If a fluid of any color comes out, then make a simple incision as I have mentioned in the case of other swellings. If no fluid comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner, as I have taught you, and hook it with hooks.  Peel the skin from every side gently, and preserve the sac if you can, so that you may remove it whole with the swelling.
If the sac is torn during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part, however small or large, remains, the swelling will most often return.
If it overcomes you and a little remains, cauterize the wound when you have finished with some sharp cauterizing agents.  Tighten the wound and place on top of it something that soothes hot swelling and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, then suture its lips and treat it with what unites [the tissues].
If you encounter a superficial or deep vein and bleeding occurs, quickly cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound becomes inflamed and the flow of blood stops. Then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter Forty-six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization:  The forms of probes; and they are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of strong iron, square-ended, tightly made so that they quickly enter tumors. These are the images of probes, and they are called "bard". They are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and hidden areas for what is inside them of bones and other things. They are made round, polished, smooth like styluses, of Chinese copper or spadroa or of copper or of iron or of silver. The best of them are those made of spadroa.
Probes can also be made of black lead. They are suitable for probing fistulas which have a bend in their depth, so that they flex with their softness along that bend. They are also of three types, for there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones.
According to the need of the depth of each fistula, and its thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks. They are of many types, for there are simple ones, that is, those with one hook.  These are of three types: large, medium, and small. And there are blind hooks, which are of three types. And there are hooks with two hooks, which are of three types. And there are curved hooks with two hooks. These are of three types. And there are hooks with three hooks, which are of three types. And all of these types, each one is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.

Image of a large hook with three hooks.
Image of a medium hook with three hooks. Image of a small hook with three hooks.
And these are images of the scalpels with which one cuts and excises the sores and tumors.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Their edges, with which one cuts, are sharpened, and the other ends are not sharpened.  Rather, they are made this way so that one may use them in excising the sore when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be somewhat comfortable and find a little relief from the burning that he finds when the tumor is excised.
And these are images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the style of the kohl applicator, and at one end is something like a wide spoon of two layers, which has in its head a concealed lancet blade resembling a bird's tongue that moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels that are hidden between the fingers when lancing tumors, so that the patient does not feel them. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated as you see, and are thin.  These types of cupping instruments should be available to you, large and small, to quickly draw blood when necessary and when medicine is not readily available.
But they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather from fleshy parts such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other small instruments can be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a place of phlebotomy or when a vein or artery is cut. And they can be made round in this manner:

On the treatment of men's breasts.
The breasts of some people may swell at the age of puberty until they resemble the breasts of women, remaining swollen and unsightly. Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with cauterizing medicine, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals.  If the breast droops downwards and becomes flaccid due to its size, as happens to women,
it should be incised in its upper sides with two crescent-shaped incisions, each connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one in this manner: From line B to line C, then remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we have mentioned of sutures and dressings and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you cannot remove all that needs to be cut away because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
In the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are a kind of hard, cystic swellings, some of which contain fluids.  Those that contain fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C. If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat with a suitable ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of nodular swellings, incise it as we mentioned in the incision for swellings. If the wound continues to suppurate, cauterize it as we previously mentioned.
Chapter forty-nine.
On the incision of a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, called aneurysma.
If an artery is injured and the skin over it heals, a tumor often results; similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or from a vein are: if the tumor is from an artery, it is oblong, deep-seated in the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a throbbing.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round, on the surface of the body. Incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other places in the body, and if they are very large; it is necessary to avoid treating them with iron.
And those also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided. As for those that are a swelling of the mouth of an artery, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have shown you in the ligation of the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the place between the ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
Then the tumor will resolve, and then you use treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a vein incision, then you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor as possible, together with the skin, then insert a needle below the place that you grasped with your hand, and pass it with a doubled thread until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, according to what I have mentioned to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread; if you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is in it comes out; then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied, then apply a pledget that you have soaked in a potion and oil. Then use treatment with cautery and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that occurs from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor occurs in an artery and vein, so too does a tumor occur in a nerve if a blow occurs to it or it occurs from excessive fatigue or the like.  This is most common in the areas of the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a subtle swelling, resembling in color the rest of the body. In most cases, it is without pain, and if pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness. The swelling is not concentrated deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, neither forward nor backward.  As for that which is in the joints, it should not be exposed to iron, for it may cause harm. And as for that which is in the head or forehead,
make an incision in the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its base. If it is large, hook it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
On cutting warts which appear in the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies. These are called  "fungal" because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin and their head is thick; their lips may be inverted. Some are small, others very large.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen, resembling mushrooms.  They were white, thin at the base, their lips inverted and cracked, and constantly discharging moisture. I cut them off; one weighed about eighteen ounces, the other about six.
In cutting them, observe: if the patient is moist, and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base, cut it with a broad scalpel. Have cautery irons ready at hand, for often much blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding is profuse, cauterize immediately. If you find the patient cowardly and afraid of being cut with iron, take a strong lead thread, and tie it tightly around the wart of this kind. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead further, continuing to tighten it.
Keep tightening until the wart is affected, until it separates and falls off by itself without further effort. If the wart has a thick base, there is some danger and uncertainty in cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen; however, it may be possible to cut off half or part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat it until the wound heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and foul-looking; for it is a cancerous tumor, and we shall describe cancer later.
Chapter fifty-two.
In the treatment of umbilical hernias.
An umbilical hernia may result from several causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as happens in other hernias; or from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as mentioned before; or from wind that collects there.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of fat, then the swelling will be similar in color to the body, soft, painless, and varying in position. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its position will be, as we have described, more variable. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns; sometimes there is gurgling, and it increases greatly upon entering a bath and with strenuous exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then in addition to these signs, the swelling appears dark. If it is due to newly grown flesh, the swelling is firm, hard, and remains at a constant size.
If it is due to wind, it will be soft to the touch. The treatment is as follows: if the umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein, or to wind, then you should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and uncertainty, as I have explained to you in the chapter where I discussed swellings arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical hernia is due to the intestine or fat, then you should instruct the patient to hold himself and stand upright, then draw a line with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then you should order him to lie on his back before you, then incise with a wide scalpel around the umbilicus at the place marked with ink. Then extend the center of the swelling upwards with a large probe, and then tie the place of the incision with a strong thread or silk ligature tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a loop. Then open the center of the tightened swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger. Search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the ligature, loosen the loop and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find fat, extend it with a probe.
And cut away its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles, and thread them with strong threads. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the swelling, crossing them, having passed them through. Then tighten the swelling at four points on the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the tightened flesh putrefies and falls off by itself, or cut it if it softens and decays. Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia is from flesh that has grown there,
or from moisture, then it is necessary to incise the swelling as we said and evacuate the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will close the wound.
Chapter fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications, and warned against treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate.  We have also mentioned cancer that develops in the womb and warned against treating it.
The ancients stated that when the cancer is in a place that can be completely excised, like cancer that is in the breast or thigh, or similar accessible members, and especially if it is small and beginning, then it should be removed entirely.  However, if it is advanced and large, then it should not be touched.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If the cancer is accessible, as we said, then you should first purge the patient with black hellebore several times, and then bleed him if there is obvious fullness in the veins.
Then you should position the patient in a way that allows you to work, and then apply the appropriate hooks to the cancer, and then scrape it from every side, together with the skin, thoroughly, until nothing of its roots remains.  Let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can. If during the procedure you encounter profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, then tie off the vessel until the bleeding stops, and then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
On the treatment of fistula.
We have already described in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medication.  That which is treated with cautery is only the ascitic type; the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not treated with cautery at all.
For that is lethal, if you have treated this type of ascitic fistula with medication and your treatment has been ineffective, then look: if the patient is extremely weak, or has another disease besides the fistula, such as...
cough or diarrhea, and the like, then avoid treating him with cautery, for that is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, has no disease other than the fistula alone, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the procedure is that you make the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him massages his abdomen with his hands, pushing the water downwards towards the pubic area. Then you take a lancet shaped like this:
pointed at both ends, long, and with a sharpened point like a lancet, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not penetrate the intestines during the procedure and injure them. Then look: if the fistula originated from the intestines…
then you should make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, directly above the pubic area. If the fistula originated from a liver disease, then let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel. If its origin is a spleen disease, then let the incision be three fingers' breadth on the right side.
Nor should the incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down, lest the fluids flow to that weak area. Then, pierce the entire skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the lancet between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches the empty space, which is the location of the water, then remove it and insert into the opening the instrument which looks like this:
It is like a small tube made of silver, copper, or smooth, polished lead, having a small opening at its lower end and three openings in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And one may sharpen its end in the form of a pen nib, like this image:
At its upper end is a ring; for when the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately descend on the instrument, and you will drain a moderate amount of water at once, for if you drain more than is necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or he may suffer a faintness close to death. But drain according to his strength and what indicates to you the state of the patient's strength from the strength of his pulse and the good color, then remove the instrument and the water will be contained, as it will be contained immediately.
Because of the skin which holds the opening on the peritoneum which I told you to suture in that manner, then return the instrument another day if you see that the patient can bear it.
And remove also a small amount of water; do this for several days, and you are responsible and careful to avoid error, until only a little water remains.  If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat it by burial in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and accustom him to thirst, and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers, and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as I described before.
Chapter fifty-five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages unperforated, or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their urethra imperforate; it is necessary to perforate it as soon as they are born.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening, and bind and hold it for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove it and then replace it. If you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine passing through the area will not allow it to close.
As for him whose opening is narrow, treat him with lead as we have said, for many days until it widens. As for those whose opening is misplaced—that is, some are born with the opening at the end of the penis and cannot urinate forward—
until he raises the urethra upwards with his hand, and it is not born before that because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line; this is a very ugly condition. The method of treatment is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, the size of a pen, as if you are carving something so that its middle is prominent, resembling a penis, and the opening is in the middle as it should be.
And be careful during your work to avoid bleeding, for this often occurs; therefore stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter fifty-six.
On the ulcer that appears in the foreskin and penis, and the blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a fleshy, rough growth, and it is benign or malignant.  The benign one should be tied off with a fine ligature.
And cut it until you completely remove it, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, then you should cauterize it after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part is outside, then you should remove the ulcer inside first, until it heals; then treat the outside.
Because if you treat both at the same time, you risk perforating the foreskin.  Also, blackness and corruption can appear in the labia and foreskin; you should excise everything that is black and is about to corrupt or has already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and acacia, then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery iron of this shape:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and the ulcer if it becomes corrupt. If the glans is eaten away and entirely destroyed at some point, then you should insert a lead tube into the urethra for the patient to urinate through. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy and who have not been circumcised.  It may also occur due to a wound or swelling.  You should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the bond is broken and the glans is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them on close examination, you should remove some of the glans and some of the foreskin.  The foreskin is thin, and it may easily perforate due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what may befall them of ailments.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and is especially used in boys, we must describe the best method of doing it.
And the easiest way leading to safety.  I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws; rather, it is something we have acquired.
by experience. That is to say, I found the majority of surgeons and barbers use purification with the scalpel and with scissors, and they use the forceps and ligature with thread and cutting with the nail.  I have tried all these methods.
I found nothing better than purification with scissors and ligature with thread, because purification with the scalpel often causes the skin to retract, since the skin of the foreskin is two layers, so perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains.
Then one is forced to make another cut and renewed pain. Purification with forceps does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, because it may enter its hole. As for purification with the nail, the skin may slip and your work will be spoiled, or the boy's skin may be naturally short.
Therefore, they are often born like that and do not need purification. I have seen this. As for purification with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its excellence to me, because the cut of the scissors is proportionate, since the blade above is like the blade below.
So when you squeeze your hand with the proportion of the two blades, you cut with one measure and in one time. Thus, the control of the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, with no mistake whatsoever. The way to proceed first is to reassure the boy.
Especially if he understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving it until another day. Then cheer and please him in every way you can and that he accepts with his mind. Then make him stand upright before you.
And do not let him sit. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his urethra, inflate the skin, and lift it up until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then cleanse it of whatever dirt gathers there. Then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it. Then hold the lower ligature firmly with your thumb and forefinger and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly raise the skin and bring out the head of the urethra. Then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt ash of dried gourd; this is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley, which is also excellent.
Then quickly raise the skin and bring out the head of the urethra. Then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt ash of dried gourd; this is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley, which is also excellent. Then apply a poultice of a cooked egg white in rose water, beaten with fresh, fine rose oil, and leave it on until the next day. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors suitable for circumcision:
It should be thin, sharp, without curve, and the nail should be well-fitted.  The length of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for the error that occurs in circumcision, sometimes the inner skin is completely or partially inverted during the cutting, therefore it should be extended with your fingernail immediately, before the area swells.
Cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute inflammation subsides and then remove it gently.
Cut it as seems best to you, and be careful of the glans penis; for if a part of the glans penis is cut, it does no harm. Treat it with what heals the wound from the poultices which we described in the chapter on poultices.
And if more of the skin than necessary is cut and it retracts upwards, this also does little harm. Treat it as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, clotted blood, pus, a growth, or something similar. If you treat this with the types of treatment mentioned in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be made to sit on his knees, then a man should mount his back and press his belly towards his back, and the patient should hold himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow by what we have mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary to use its removal with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather quill in thinness, about a span and a half long, with a gentle funnel at its head. The way to draw urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool is left over so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and seat the patient on a chair.
And cleanse his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, and then push the catheter inside.
Until the urethra is completely bent, then push the catheter inside until it reaches near the rectum; incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has reached something empty.
This method is used because the passage through which urine flows is winding. Then pull the thread with the wool gently; the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it, and the urine will flow out.  Replace the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Illustrations of instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, with a long tube as thin as pus.  If you wish to instill water or medicine, this is done with an instrument called a syringe; this is its image.
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, with a long tube as thin as a millet stalk, hollow throughout except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part in which the propellant is, should be just large enough to fit it without excess, so that when it draws up moisture, it is drawn up, and when it pushes, it pushes outwards, as does the syringe with which oil is thrown in sea battles.
If you wish to introduce fluids into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and draw upwards on the piston; the fluid will be drawn into the body of the syringe. Then insert its tip into the urethra, as described for catheters, and then push the fluid with the piston.
Then that fluid will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it. This is also the image of a delicate clyster with which the bladder is injected.
It is made of silver or leather; its upper end resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove in which the ligature is placed. Then take a camel's bladder and put in it the fluid you want to inject into the bladder; then tie it tightly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
Warm the fluid slightly over a fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then squeeze the bladder containing the fluid firmly until the patient feels that the fluid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin material and make a circle from it; pierce it all around. Then insert a strong thread into these holes as they go around; then gather the circle as you would gather a tablecloth, after placing in it whatever fluids, ointments, and waters you desire.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the extraction of stones.
We have already mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medication, and described the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.  We have also described the stones which require manual intervention and incision.
These are the stones formed specifically in the bladder and those which lodge in the urethra, and I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that stones formed in the bladder most often affect boys, and one of their signs is that the urine passes from the bladder like water in its thinness.
Sand appears in it, and he scratches and plays with his penis; it often hangs down, then swells, and the anus protrudes in many of them.  It is easily expelled in boys until they reach fourteen years of age, and is difficult in old men; as for young men, it is intermediate between these two.
The larger the stone, the easier its treatment; the smaller, the opposite.  If we proceed to treatment, it is first necessary to administer an enema to the patient to evacuate all the faeces from his intestines, for it may prevent the detection of the stone.
Then the patient is taken by his legs, and shaken downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times. Then seat him between your hands upright, his hands under his thighs, so that the whole bladder inclines downwards, then examine him.
And feel it externally. If you feel the stone in the space, immediately begin to incise it.  If it does not fall under your touch at all, you should lubricate the index finger with oil from your left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully developed boy, insert it into his anus and search for the stone until, when it is under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you wish to incise.
And you order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch with his right hand the scrotum upwards, and with his other hand to stretch the skin under the scrotum away from the place where the incision will be. Then take the lancet, the shape of which is this:
And you incise between the anus and the scrotum, not in the middle, but towards the left side of the perineum. The incision should be on the stone itself, with your finger in the rectum, and you press it outwards obliquely so that the incision is wide externally and narrow internally, to the extent that the stone can pass through.
Do not make it larger, for perhaps the finger in the rectum will press the stone during the incision, and it will come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones which have angles and edges, making their removal difficult for that reason.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and round, so their removal is easy.  But if it has angles and edges, then enlarge the incision a little.  If it does not come out like this, then you should devise a way to grasp it, either with a tightly-fitting forceps whose end is like a rasp.
to secure the stone so that it does not escape, or else insert a delicate instrument with a hooked end under it. If you cannot remove it this way, enlarge the incision a little. If you are overcome by blood, stop it with alum.
If there is more than one, push the largest first towards the bladder opening, then incise upon it, then push the smaller ones afterwards.  Do the same if there are more than two. If it is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision upon it, because two things will result for the patient.
Either he will die, or he will experience constant urinary incontinence because the wound will not heal at all. But try to push it out, or devise a way to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, cauterize the wound with  costmary, aloes, and myrrh, and bandage it. Place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water, on top of it to soothe the hot inflammation. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm unguent and basil unguent until it heals. If excessive hot inflammation, gangrene, or something similar occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination—and this is known by the appearance of blood in the urine—
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with a similar treatment until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, it is necessary to bind and bring together the thighs to secure the medicines applied to the area. If the stone is small and has lodged in the urethra, preventing the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before it necessitates incision.
I have often dispensed with incision using this treatment, which I have tested.  It involves taking a steel probe, which looks like this:
The end is triangular, sharp, and fixed in a shaft. Then take a thread and tie the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, then gently insert the probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone little by little, aiming to pierce it until you pass through to the other side. Then the urine will flow immediately. Then press your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis, for it will crumble and exit with the urine and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible due to some impediment, tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone. Then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two threads and extract it.
Then untie the ligature and clean the clotted blood which has formed in the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other ligature above is so that when the thread is untied after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should raise the skin upward so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound, as we said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the extraction of stones from women.
Stones rarely develop in women; if one should appear, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and another is that you will not find a woman who permits herself to a physician.
If she is chaste or a relative, and thirdly, you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially in working with the hands, and fourthly, the place of incision for stones in women is distant from the location of the stone, so a deep incision is needed.
And in that there is danger; if necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, but they are rarely found.  If you do not find one, seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or get a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who knows something of this craft.
Then prepare her and instruct her to do everything you order, first examining for the stone.  That is, if the woman is a virgin, she should insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and presses it under her finger…
then you order her to incise it. If she is not a virgin but a widow, order the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should move it from the mouth of the bladder downwards as far as she can until she reaches the groin, then incise it opposite the middle of the vagina at the groin, whichever side she feels the stone on.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it underneath. Let the incision be small at first, then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision as much as is needed for the stone to come out. And know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small and some large, smooth and rough, long and round, and some branched.  Know their types so you can determine what you need. If the bleeding overwhelms you, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
until the stone comes out. And prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men to assist you in your work. If the bleeding overwhelms you and you know from the throbbing of the blood that it is from a severed artery, place the styptic on the area.
And bind it tightly with bandages and leave it; do not disturb it, and leave the stone; do not remove it, for the patient may die. Then treat the wound. When the severity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until you remove the stone.
Chapter sixty-two.
On the incision for the watery swelling.
The watery swelling is an accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle, and it may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature in some part of the testicle.
So that one thinks it is another testicle. It is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum which we have mentioned, but this is rare. This swelling develops from weakness affecting the testicles, so that this matter settles there.  It may also result from a blow to the testicles.
This moisture is of many colours; it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or black and dirty, or white and watery, which is most common. The signs by which it is recognized are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum which we have mentioned, the swelling is roundish and slightly elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, one imagines that it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum, then it is palpable. But if you wish to know the colour of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe, the image of which has been given previously;  then judge what is inside by what comes out with the probe.
If we proceed to treatment with cautery, you should order the patient to be bled if he is able and you see that his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, and you should place many cloths beneath him, then you should sit on his left.
And you should order a servant to sit on his right, extending his penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the groin. Then you take a wide scalpel and incise the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the pubis.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum in half, until you reach the white peritoneum containing [the testicle]; then strip it back, being careful not to tear it. Your stripping should be more on the side adhering to the testicle, and strip back as far as you can.
Then widely incise the peritoneum filled with water and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and draw the peritoneum upwards, but do not touch the containing scrotum skin. Cut the peritoneum however you can, either completely or piecemeal.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure that the water will not return. If the testicle emerges from its covering during your work, when you have finished cutting the peritoneum, replace it then close the edges of the scrotum skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. If the testicle is found to be corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary to ligate the vessels in the spermatic cord to prevent bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle; then treat it as mentioned.
If the fluid is collected on both sides, know that they are two hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, similarly. If it is convenient for you to perform both operations at once, do so, then wipe away the blood.
Insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose ointment, and apply externally more wool soaked in a potion and oil, spreading it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen, then place folded cloths on top; these are the compresses. And tie it from above with a six-tailed bandage in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffed wool in this manner.  Make the straps with which it is fastened from cotton or wet wool, and gather them tightly in the waistband of the trousers; one strap is taken across the buttocks to the back.
The second is taken towards the pubis, and the two straps are placed on the thighs below, and the remaining two straps on the groins; all the tightening is gathered in the waistband of the trousers.  This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
This is done by taking a small, sharp cautery iron and incising the skin of the scrotum with it while hot, as we described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed; then take another cautery iron of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye; then sear that peritoneum with it while hot until all the moisture comes out; then stretch the peritoneum with hooks and scrape off the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can until you excise it all, and be careful not to touch the testicle with the fire.
Know that this procedure is safer and prevents blood loss more effectively than incision.  If during the incision or cauterization you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or something else, you should treat whatever occurs according to the appropriate treatment previously mentioned.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then use cauterization as I describe, if it is confirmed by the evidence we have presented.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a high chair, and then sear the lower part of the swelling with a wide scalpel. Make the cauterization along the length of the body and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out. Then apply cotton to the area and bandage it.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out when you cauterize it, and this is because the white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the water from coming out,
then you should insert a goose feather or the instrument used to extract water from hydroceles, the image of which has been shown previously, or enlarge the opening of the wound slightly.
Know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it collects, cauterize it in the same way, and the patient should protect himself during those days.
Chapter sixty-three.
On the incision on the fleshy membrane and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this membrane is one of the dangerous things leading to death in most cases; therefore, we see that it should be left alone and kept safe.  I will now mention working on it and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies which are composed of the two testicles, and this is due to many causes; either from a sharp fluid flowing to the testicles, or from a blow.  The color of the swelling is the color of the body, and it does not contain water.
And the swelling is firm, and perhaps the swelling is hardened, its color is dark, and it is insensitive. It may be from the twisting and swelling of the arteries, as has been previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins. That which is from the swelling of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it does not disperse. And it should not be incised at all. As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it disperses when pressed with the fingers. And this type may be incised, as well as other flesh.
And that is to incise the skin of the testicle, then to extend the testicle upwards and bring it out of the white peritoneum, and to free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and to ligate the vessels, and to cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every side of the testicle, if the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh.
Then it is necessary to bring out the testicle and cut it. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritoneums or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is from behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it and bring out the testicle as we said. When your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter sixty-four.
In the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, similar to a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the intestines and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.  The treatment of this condition is similar to what has been mentioned before, and is quite perilous.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to seat the patient on a high chair, then push the intestinal contents downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
And let a servant hold it for you, stretching it tightly. Then, incise with a wide, sharp scalpel, making an oblique incision alongside the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then, dissect from each side as I described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the temples. Then, insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the first place where the hernia appeared and tie it also at its end, then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along its length, and remove what has collected inside of it from the foul, putrid fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, so that it will heal and the vessels that nourish one of the intestines will fall away; this is not a problem. But if the hernia affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the intestines with the vessels, lest the testicle lack nourishment. before cutting the vessels, so that they wither and are of no use.
Chapter Sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a fissure that appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen near the groins from the abdominal cavity, so the intestine descends from that rupture into one of the scrotums.
And this rupture is either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, and the like.  Its sign, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine. Its sign, if it is from a fissure in the peritoneum, is that it initially causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling appears differently under the skin nearby.
That is by the exit of the intestine and its passage outside of the peritoneum.  The omentum may exit with the intestine, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental. It may be with gas, and the stool may flow into the intestine and be retained there, resulting in the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if constricted. Treatment of these types of illness with cautery is dangerous, so one should be cautious about resorting to it. The method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine into his abdomen by hand if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs. Then you extend the skin next to the groin upwards and incise the entire skin of the scrotum lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to emerge. Then you dissect the membranes under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on all sides. Then you insert your index finger into the area next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and you loosen the adhesions behind the testicle. Then with your right hand you pull inwards on the skin of the scrotum, and with your left hand you extend the white peritoneum upwards, raising the testicle with the peritoneum toward the incision.
You instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you completely loosen the adhesions from behind.  You explore with your finger lest there be any twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum; if you find any, push it down into the abdomen.
Then you take a needle with thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotum skin next to the incision. Then you cut the ends of the twisted thread so that there are four threads. Then you overlap them firmly and tie them tightly to the peritoneum which, as we said, is under the scrotum skin, on two sides. Then you also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish them can reach them. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave of the peritoneum under the scrotum skin the amount of a finger bone.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave of the peritoneum under the scrotum skin the amount of a finger bone. And you cut all the rest in a circle and remove the testicle with it. Then you make an incision at the bottom of the scrotum skin from which blood and pus flow, as we described before. Then use wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound and use the ligature which we described.
And the white peritoneum, which we mentioned after its cutting, may be cauterized cautiously against bleeding, for that often happens.  And you leave the ligature until it falls off by itself. If it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with hot water and apply something that will make it sweat until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  I have not seen anyone dare to treat this windy hernia with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a sac, that is, that the vessels should be gently ligated below after incision.
Then you incise in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the vessels fall off, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum, and this happens from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
And it may be treated with an iron instrument in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely to the extent of three fingers, then you loosen the peritoneum which is under the skin.
Until, when the white peritoneum which follows is uncovered, you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the end of the probe and attach one to the other with the suture.
Then you withdraw the probe, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Then if the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this situation because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the scrotum.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  Whoever wishes to treat it should put the patient to sleep on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin over the thick skin, then brings the two lips together; and if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it may be in the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it, and he may know the treatment of someone who suffers from it; and the other, that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like of animals.  So I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  That which is done by crushing, its method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not discernible to the touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the cords and make one incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them after you have skinned them and do not leave anything of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.  This type of castration is better than that which is done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types: one is that which appears in what is behind the scrotum or in the skin of the testicle between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the skin of the testicle.
As for women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male genitals, protruding outwards, one of them like a man's penis and the two like testicles. And the treatment of the three types.
The two types from men and the one type from women, it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type from men, from which urine comes forth which is in the skin of the testicle, there is no action in it nor is there any benefit from removing it at all.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural state, until it becomes large and unsightly, and it may grow large in some women until it is spread like that of men and leads to intercourse.
It is necessary to grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it, and do not go to excess in cutting, especially in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outwards like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the tail-like disease.  It should be cut as the clitoris is cut, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
In the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This may be natural, from birth, or accidental.  The accidental kind results from a pre-existing condition, such as an excessive growth of flesh.
or a thin or thick membrane.  This may be located in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or above or below it. It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and may also prevent menstruation.  Its identification is done by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is apparent and near, but if it is not apparent, then she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then immediately pierce it. This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs of both hands.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread. Then, she forcefully stretches the labia until she pierces the thin membrane and the obstruction opens. Then she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the area. The woman has intercourse every day, so that the area does not close again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, then it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from an excessive growth of flesh, then hook it with hooks and cut it.  Have with you styptics that do not sting, such as acacia, shiyan, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube, so that the wound does not close quickly. Keep it in place for several days and use a wick of dry linen. Then treat it with the usual treatment for healing until it is healed.  Another growth of flesh may appear in the uterus; it should be cut in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor.  A cancerous tumor that is in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the mouths of the veins, so that much blood constantly flows from them. If hemorrhoids persist, they become warts.  I have already mentioned their types and signs in the classification; we will mention them here.
What accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment. I say that if hemorrhoids and warts are deep in the uterus and do not appear to the touch, then there is no treatment for them with iron.  Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and are palpable are treatable.
It is necessary that the woman enter a cool house, then stretch the warts with a scraper or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots. Then apply to them, if blood flows, one of the styptics that stop blood without causing pain.
Such as acacia,  cistus, and frankincense, and similar things. Then she should raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, then seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and similar things. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping to the loins and breasts without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of spurge, or the juice of verbascum, or the juice of the branches of  the  ivy with a gallnut solution and apply it to the place.
If the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pimple, it resembles the heads of millet, rough in appearance. It is necessary to cut what appears of it, according to what I mentioned concerning warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the suppuration which occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, fistulas, the phagedenic ulcer,  fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary that we mention in this chapter the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors which collect for a time, how its suppuration is done with iron.  It is necessary to observe; if the pain of the tumor is severe in its beginning, with throbbing, inflammation and fever,
and you see it red when you touch it, do not hasten its suppuration, and treat it with what aids in ripening, until when these symptoms subside; then it is necessary that the woman sit on a chair with two seats and lean on its back.
and she gathers her legs towards the lower part of her abdomen, and her thighs are spread apart, and her arms are placed under her knees, and they are bound with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the image of which comes later. And it is necessary, if you wish to use this instrument, that you estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
This harms the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that pledgets be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is necessary that the spiral which runs in the instrument be on the upper side.
And you hold the instrument and the assistant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened.  Then, if the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, then it is necessary to incise it at its head with a wide scalpel. Then, when all the pus is evacuated,
it is necessary that a soft pledget soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent be placed in the wound, and the pledget should be outside the incision in the cervix; and clean wool soaked in water in which alum has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and on the pubis.
Then, after two days, treat with the ointment which is suitable for this until it heals.
And the uterus and the wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long rhubarb has been boiled, then return to the ointment; if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but it should be treated with what we mentioned in the section.
Chapter Seventy-Five.
On instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural manner.
The midwife should first know the form of natural childbirth.  Among its signs, if you see the woman straining downwards and yearning to breathe air, and what she is suffering from childbirth becomes easier for her.
And the emergence of the fetus is hastened. Know that this birth is in the natural manner, and its emergence is head-first with the placenta either with it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the fetus emerges quickly.
For if it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it and cleanses itself well from those impurities.  Anything other than this birth is unnatural and reprehensible, for the fetus may emerge feet-first, or its hands and feet may emerge before its head.
Or one hand or one foot, or its head and hand may emerge, or it may emerge folded, and perhaps it turns over onto its back, and similar reprehensible forms.  Therefore, the midwife should be skillful and gentle with all these things and beware of mistakes and errors.
And I am explaining each form and how to deal with it so that you may recognize and understand it. If the fetus emerges head-first, the natural emergence, and this is difficult for the woman and the labor pains are severe for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and instruct women to support her.
And apply a poultice of cooked fenugreek and moist ointments to her womb. Then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and incises the placenta, or incises it with her fingernail, until the moisture within flows out, and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then she should inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with shirāj ointment. Then, after the injection, she should instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then they should be gently returned little by little.
If it is not possible to insert [the hand], then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs upwards, then shake the stool on the ground while the woman holds on so that she does not fall when it is shaken. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, then cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for then it will come out.  The emergence of the fetus with its feet: if the fetus emerges with its feet, then they should be pushed upwards, and then the fetus should be turned little by little until it is straightened, then take one of its legs and extend it little by little.
When they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, for then it will come out. If it does not come out as we have described, otherwise, return the fetus little by little until it is in its natural position, for then it will emerge smoothly. If it is prevented by all that we have described.
Take some henbane saliva, fenugreek saliva, shirāj ointment, and dissolved gum arabic, and pound everything well in a mortar. Then apply it to the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the sharasif.
If you see that her lower parts have softened, make a pessary for her from bitter aloes and let her retain it.  When the pessary has been retained for an hour, seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze, closing her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen; then the fetus will come out immediately. The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, carefully insert your hands little by little; then the woman should lie on her back, hanging her loins downwards while lying on a bed, and she should clasp her hands; then gently press above her abdomen. Then remove the cushions from under her legs so that her lower parts are elevated. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously, then gently press above the perineum until the fetus ascends upwards. Then the midwife inserts her hand and gradually adjusts the fetus.
And instruct the woman to strain until the fetus emerges.  The emergence of the fetus crosswise, hanging by one of its hands. Carefully try to return its hand; if you cannot return it, make the woman stand and walk. If she cannot walk, let her lie down.
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the pessary that I described from the ingredients. If labor pains seize her, seat her on a chair, then treat the returning of the hand and adjusting the fetus into the natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and gently adjust it. Once it is straight, apply what we described of the ointment and pessaries to the vulva.
Then tell her to move slightly. If she does this, seat her on the chair and tell her to lean to her right side. Then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; then it will emerge. The emergence of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your fingernail until it is free of moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the umbilical cord lest it suffocate and die, then push the fetus inwards until it is as it should be.
And instruct the woman to strain repeatedly; then it will emerge easily. The emergence of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live, although this is rare. As for five, it is something outside of nature; they will not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by one placenta, and they are separated by a membrane barrier between them, connected to the umbilical cord of each one. They may emerge like a single fetus, naturally and easily, or they may emerge in a difficult manner as we described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and become as we have described in unnatural forms, treat them as we have described. Let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and patience, and let her devise a solution for every situation with whatever means she can find that leads to safety.
Mention of what is conceived in the womb of fetuses that are aborted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb. It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the will of the Almighty and Knowing. All of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing may occur to her one day, so that she may meet it as is appropriate.
Chapter seventy-six.
In the extraction of the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to use your hand, then you should look: if the woman is healthy and strong, and has none of the symptoms that one fears might cause her death, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is drawn out.
Then her vulva should be moistened with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the dog and fenugreek and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and saliva, and then gently insert it into the womb; then she should seek with it a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and the suitable locations for that.
Look: if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or into the nape of its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its chin or clavicle, or into the areas near the ribs, or under the scapulae.
But if its descent is feet first, then [insert the hooks] into the groin and the middle ribs.  It is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand, and to place its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and to insert the hand gently and insert a hook into some of those locations that we have mentioned.
Until you reach something empty, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the traction is even and does not lean to one side. Then pull with a steady pull; and the pull should not be straight only, but should be moved in every direction.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a molar when it is extracted.  It is necessary, in the meantime, to relax the pull; if it is obstructed from one side, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to rotate what is obstructed. If part of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other locations.
She should do this until the entire fetus emerges. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned because of its compression, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it is entirely emerged, it is cut.
Either at the joint of the wrist or at the elbow.  And thus she should do with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences difficulty in its exit, or if there is collected water in its head, then it is necessary to insert a hooked scalpel between the fingers.
And to incise the head with it so that the water emerges, or to extract it with the instrument called the *mishdakh*, the image of which comes with the images of the other instruments in the chapter which follows this.
She should do likewise if the fetus is naturally large-headed. Then it is necessary to incise the skull or crush it with the *mishdakh*, as we have said, then to extract the bones with forceps. If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, then let it be incised until the moisture in the chest flows out.
For the chest then constricts. If the chest does not constrict and its emergence is not achieved, then cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or if it has a blister, then it is necessary to puncture it so that the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then pulling it is easy and straightening it to the mouth of the womb is simple. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and incise the abdomen or chest until what is in them flows out.
If all the limbs are extracted and the head is retracted and retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, then she inserts her hand into the neck of the womb and seeks the head with it and pulls it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb, then inserts one or two hooks into it and pulls it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has constricted due to a hot swelling affecting it, then it is not necessary to be forceful with it, but it is necessary then to use the pouring of oily, moist things and to use compresses and to sit in waters that relax and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it is possible to straighten it, then let what we mentioned for the living fetus be used. If that is not possible, then let it be cut and removed. It is necessary not to leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all. When you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned of the treatment for the hot swellings that appear in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, then let her descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments.  And I have witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a swelling appeared in her uterus and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus.  I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close, so I placed on it some strong, drawing ointments.
Then a bone came out of the place. Then days passed, and another bone came out. I was amazed by this, since the abdomen is a place where there is no bone. I estimated that it was from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and took out many bones from the bones of the fetus's head.
I continued doing this until I removed many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived for a time afterward, with a little pus issuing from the place. And I have only mentioned this rarity here.
Because in it there is knowledge and help for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are the images of the instruments which are needed in removing the fetus.
Image of a screw to open the mouth of the womb.
This is the binder with which books are bound; it has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binder, and should be either of ebony or of boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width is about a finger, and their length is a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two guides of the same material as the wood itself, which are fastened in them; their length is half a span or a little more, and their width is about two fingers or a little more, and these two guides…
are those which enter the mouth of the womb to open it by turning the screws.  Image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two guides at its end, as you see; the length of each guide is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the womb with it,
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two guides, close together, into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the hooks, to whatever extent you want to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants. Image of another screw mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument which pushes the fetus.
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is grasped.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, it cuts with them and tears.
Image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when the fetus is pulled with it. Image of a hook with two barbs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his reputation among people. Therefore, do not despise any instrument that you have prepared, for there will inevitably be a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
On the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then cause her to sneeze with a [nasal] catheter, and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out in this way, well and good; otherwise, take measures.
And pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, henbane, dill, chamomile, wormwood,  fumitory, and centaury—all of these medicaments or some of them—and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then cause her to sneeze as we said. Then the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in  oil of ceruse or mallow juice.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out little by little. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, until, when you find the placenta, you pull it out little by little, carefully.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, but it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling is increased. Then it will yield and become free from adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described treatment with sneezing and treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, avoid violence upon it in pulling again, but it is necessary to tie what has come out of it to the mouth of the womb to the thigh of the woman, then inject her with the tetrapharmacon ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out, except that if it becomes putrid, a bad smell will rise from it to the stomach and head, and that will harm the patient.  Therefore, suitable fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried the fumigation of rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and so on:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper. The thin end is placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the embers. She holds it until that incense is gone and replaces it with more.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys are born with their rectums imperforate; a thin membrane has closed it.  The midwife should perforate this membrane with her finger; otherwise, let her incise it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she places wool soaked in syrup and oil upon it, then treats it with ointments until it heals. If she fears it will close up, she places a lead tube in the opening for many days, removing it whenever the child wants to defecate.
The rectum may also become obstructed by the healing of a wound or a tumor.  This adhesion should be incised, then treated as described above, with medication and the lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower area.
Fistulas which occur in the lower area are a complication and thickening which occurs near the anus externally or internally, from one side or another. The fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus drains from it. Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the bladder and the intestine, while others do not.  Penetrating fistulas can be identified by the passage of feces and flatus from them when the patient defecates.
Worms may also emerge from them.  There may be fistulas, if they are internal, penetrating to the bladder and the urethra; and there may be some penetrating to the hip joint and the sacrum.  A fistula penetrating to the rectum is also distinguishable from one that does not.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and introduce a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, introduce a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair with your finger. If you feel nothing at all, and nothing like feces, flatus, or worms emerges from the opening as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating, and proceed to treatment.
If the fistula penetrates to the bladder or urethra, the indication is the passage of urine from it and the failure of the site to heal with medication.  If it penetrates to the hip joint or sacrum, the sign is the probe reaching that location.
If there is no tortuosity to the bone, and pain is present in that region, and pus constantly emerges from it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment—all these penetrating fistulas—there is no cure for them at all.
And their treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt them. As for those that are not penetrating and are not chronic, recovery is hoped for with cautery, as I describe and have tested.  The patient should lie on their back between your hands.
Raise his legs and tilt his thighs towards his abdomen. Then insert the copper or lead probe, if the fistula is tortuous, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the rectum, you should insert your index finger into the rectum.
If you feel the probe with your finger, clearly exposed, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not tire yourself with it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
It has been said that it heals in some people rarely. Of the treatments which hope for benefit is to heat a thin cautery iron according to the size of the fistula, as previously explained, and insert it, hot, into the fistula until it reaches towards the rectum, then repeat this two or three times.
Until you know that all that excess, matted flesh resembling a bird's quill has been burned. Then treat it with a pledget soaked in butter, until the burned flesh is removed, then treat it with healing ointments; if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger which is in the rectum, and there was a thick partition of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin at the beginning of the fistula. And as you pass with the incision along with the probe, which is in the fistula, until you reach with the incision where the end of the probe has reached, and the probe is released and falls out. Then cleanse that matted flesh resembling a bird's quill, so that nothing remains of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If blood overwhelms you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, then the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a strong medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with pledgets soaked in butter or sulfur powdered with oil, until the place suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that grow firm flesh.
These are medicines which constrict and dry, for when it is closed, it is healed and there is no fear of recurrence.  If the fistula has reached the depth of the rectum and is far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a membrane of peritoneum or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then the action in it is only by way of hope, and that is to use one of three methods: either to cauterize it as we said.
Or to incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can easily insert pledgets and treat from near, and do not extend the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the rectum, so that involuntary bowel movements occur in the patient. Then treat it as we mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or to penetrate that membrane and pierce it after incising it near the rectum, as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then clean out all the hardened flesh in the incision as far as you can, thoroughly.
Then suture the whole wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it closes, and the fistula remains open inside the rectum, which is easier for the patient. And the fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the rectum toward the surface of the body with the skin and the circumference of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's needle, in this manner:
And insert a twisted thread of five or so threads into it, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is penetrating into the margin of the rectum from inside, nearby.
Then bring the thread out through that hole by inserting your finger into the rectum and bringing out the end of the thread, and bring both ends together and tighten them, and leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is severed and falls away.  Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it however you can, except that it should not be too deep, for you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then proceed as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised: the hook is very sharp, and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not needed, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
Concerning the opening of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them.
And they are single or numerous, and are outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are mostly less moist, with yellow water or a little blood constantly flowing from them, and they are the color of the flesh.
The treatment of those inside the rectum is that you order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you quickly grasp them with hooks or seize them with your fingernail and cut them at their bases; if the hooks do not hold because of their moisture and laxity,
then roughen them with a coarse cloth or a piece of rough sponge, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them. Then, after cutting, sprinkle some sharp powders on them to act in place of cautery, or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not come out, inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the rectum and cause it to come out quickly when the patient strains. As for the hemorrhoids outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and simple.
That is, you grasp them with your fingernail or hook them with a hook and cut them, then treat them as we have mentioned until they heal. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron, it is necessary that he use ligature in this way: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread below the needle while it is crosswise, and pull the hemorrhoid tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one without piercing it.
so that the excess blood will flow from them. Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or kyrioti oil on the rectum and tell the patient to be still, then leave him until they fall off. When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from the dryness of the stool and the retention of the temperament. If they become chronic and medicine does not work, then it is necessary to scrape it with the blade of a scalpel or with your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer, which prevents its healing, is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more severely than the first time until it bleeds well and is skinned, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and the ant.
A nail is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs on the whole body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the nail, grasp it with a hook or forceps, and pull it out from its root, then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as previously described in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, matted, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
They frequently appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it, or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off.  If you wish, cauterize it as previously described with fire or a caustic medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I have described in the treatment of the ant. As for the ant [wart], it is also a small, matted, thick protrusion on the surface of the body, extending very deep; and if it is exposed to cold, one feels a sensation similar to the stinging of ants.
It occurs throughout the body, but most often on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube made of a strong goose feather or eagle feather, and place this tube over the ant [wart] so that the circle of the tube surrounds it on all sides; then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the ant [wart].
Then push it into the depth of the flesh, and the ant [wart] will be removed from its root. If you wish, do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The upper part of the tube should be solid and twisted to make it easier for the fingers to grasp and twist it. If you wish, cauterize the ant [wart] as previously described in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the shapes of instruments used for injections in rectal ailments, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, china, or cast or beaten copper.  These instruments may be made small or large, according to the users. Those used to treat young children should be small, and those whose rectums are narrow or painful should have very gentle syringes.  Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is attached, is wide in this manner; it has a stopper where the bladder is tied, as you see.  Its lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, is solid, very smooth, and slender; on one side are two holes, and on the other, one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of an awl, or slightly larger. The bladder, in which the medicine is placed, should be made from an animal bladder or sheepskin, fashioned like a small bag, its diameter being one cubit.
It is pierced with many holes in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then, a strong thread, made of twisted yarn of ten or so strands, is inserted into these holes, and the bladder is gathered together like a bag. Then, when the medicine is placed inside, it is tightly tied at the head of the syringe between two stones, and then it is injected.  This is an image of the circle of the bladder and the hole:
The method of injection is to fill the skin or bladder with warmed medicine, to a degree the patient can tolerate. Be careful that it is not excessively hot or cold. Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs.
A mat or blanket is placed under him. Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or something similar. Then it is gently inserted into the rectum. Then an assistant takes the bag in both hands and squeezes it strongly until everything in the syringe is emptied into the intestines.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medicine stimulates evacuation, let him restrain himself as much as he can. If he sleeps all night with it, it is more effective. If it is injected for diarrhea and evacuation is hastened, repeat the injection until he recovers.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very gentle and smooth, smoother than those used to inject children. This is an image of a gentle syringe with its skin stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I mentioned in the classification the treatment of things similar to cauterizations, and I will mention here their treatment by hand and by medication completely. I say that wounds differ according to the thing which causes the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things which cause wounds are many, like the blow of a stone, or a cut from a sword or knife, or a stab from a lance or stick or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to locations on the body, like a wound which occurs on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or liver, and similar organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds especially, because the complex ones will be mentioned in the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; and if it is from a blow of a stone or the like, and only the skin has been split, and the wound is large and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then I hasten and incise the cephalic vein appropriately. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength, if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is little; and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side to the injured part.
And warn the patient against fullness, and thick drinks and foods; and if something prevents his bloodletting, let him reduce food and not approach meat or drinks.  And apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with a styptic drink.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not changed it, the vulnerary which I describe to you shortly; but if the air has changed it, apply to it some ointments.
Until pus is formed, then treat it until it heals. And if the wound is large, and is from a cut of a sword or the like, and its edges do not come together by themselves, then join it by suturing, as I describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs down, and its adhesion is only in a small part, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines which produce firm flesh instead of the skin, and order the patient to nourish himself with foods containing strength, such as heads and brains and the like.
If gangrene occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all that is gangrenous and throw it away, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding blood, and the bleeding does not stop with medicines, search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, sever it with the scalpel and tie it. And if necessity demands, if what we have mentioned is not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy and simple; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling on them this vulnerary while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes them. The preparation of the vulnerary is: take one part frankincense, two parts of acacia, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime; crush all together, sift it, and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly so that it adheres well.
It will coagulate with the blood; then bandage it from above with bandages and leave it; do not unbind it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not come off until it heals.  Lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and acacia.
This action may also be done with alum in many large wounds if its application and binding are properly done, and the wounds are fresh and bleeding, provided the air has not changed them; but if the air has changed them somewhat, especially in summer,
then there is no point in applying this vulnerary; treat it as mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments, or apply a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until the pus is drawn out, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is slight, pull it with a splint.  I have described the treatment of fractures of the head in what follows, in the surgery of the neck; if the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound of the head if it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with things that contract strongly, such as verdigris and vitriol and the like, for they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
And nothing cold at all should be placed on the wound because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection is to the brain, which is the noblest of the organs; and what you treat it with should be soft medicines, such as natron washed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or rose oil and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner and moist ointments. But if the wound is large, use sutures or approximate its lips with pledgets, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a depth and a cavity forms in its bottom where pus collects, lance it in the lowest place in it. If an artery has been severed in the wound and you observe its blood flowing, ligate it or cauterize it or tie it off if necessity demands it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx and the windpipe remains intact, approximate the edges of the skin by sutures over the windpipe, but do not touch the windpipe itself; rather, smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, then tighten it firmly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments which have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it; if there are bone splinters in it, extract them all, or as many as you can; and what you cannot remove, leave until the wound becomes foul and heals, and their removal becomes easy.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle upon it the powders we have described. If a bone becomes foul in the wound and suppurates, treat it with what will be mentioned in its chapter, in the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see it has depth, look; if air escapes from it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If it does not have depth and is fresh with its blood, do not at first apply powders to it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth.
Then it will return to the heart and kill the patient. But place on it an attracting ointment and dress it twice a day. If you do not have an ointment, place in the mouth of the wound old lint to absorb the moisture which comes from it, and place the patient to sleep on the wound.
so that what collects in it may flow out. And if three days or more have passed since the infliction of the wound, and the patient has not experienced convulsions, or bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and you see all his conditions are good, know that the wound is healthy, so treat it with cautery and other treatment until it heals.
If it is difficult to see it and the discharge is always continuous, know that it has become suppurating, so treat it in its chapter; the patient on the wound, so that what collects in it may flow out, and if the wound is in the chest or back, treat it as previously described with stitching.
If it is large, with powders; if it is small, if it has affected the bone and broken off pieces from it, explore the wound and proceed to remove those pieces if they are clean; if they are not clean, leave them until...
the wound becomes putrid, for then it is easy to remove them. As for the other wounds occurring in the other members, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.

On wounds of the abdomen, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound which occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  The large one may have one or several intestines protruding from it, and their replacement and suturing will be more difficult and arduous.
A small wound may also be difficult in another way, and its replacement may be more difficult. If the intestine is not immediately replaced in its place, it swells and thickens, making its replacement more difficult. For this reason, the medium-sized wound is preferable, because the replacement of the intestine is not as difficult with it as it is in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types: two are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing other wounds of the body; and the other two are specific, applicable to other wounds, but they are most especially for the suturing of the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and a part of the intestine protrudes from it and its replacement is difficult, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been swollen by the cold air.
If this is the case, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or a damp cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in water in which anise, rue, and spikenard have been cooked, and wiping the intestine with it until the swelling resolves.
A medicament with astringent properties may also do this, and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.  When you see the swelling has resolved, moisten the intestine with water in which alkanet or madder has been cooked, for it makes its replacement easier.
If its return is still difficult after this treatment, then enlarge the wound slightly with the instrument used to open fistulas.  The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision. Incision is only resorted to after necessity and the failure of other methods. This is the image of the instrument:
One side of it is curved and limited, the other side is unlimited. The thin end is not as sharp as a lancet, but somewhat blunter. It is an instrument resembling a small forceps, as you see. When the wound has been widened and the intestine returned, it should be replaced in its natural form.
And its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the wound is wide and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised higher than his head; if it is in the upper abdomen, his head and chest should be raised higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always keep the side where the surgery is performed higher than the other side.  This should be done in major and moderate surgeries.
As for minor surgeries, position the patient as you are able. Then have a skilled assistant at hand, holding the entire wound with both hands, bringing its edges together, and then revealing it to the suture operator bit by bit.
This is the description of a single general suture: take one needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space at the end of the wound about the thickness of the little finger and insert a single needle without thread into the edges of the skin. with the edges of the peritoneum under the skin from the inside, until you pass it through from that side.  Having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, forming four layers, then tie a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then leave a space the thickness of a finger also, and insert another needle, then fasten it with thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as needed until you have completed the entire circumference of the wound. Let the needles be of moderate thickness.
For very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, they should be of moderate thickness, and the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too deeply.
lest the flesh be quickly severed and the wound open before it heals; nor should the stitches be too far apart, lest the wound fail to unite. Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they injure the patient when he sleeps, and make for him pads of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is best suited for small wounds, because one or two needles, or so, may suffice for suturing them.
As for the method of suturing the second type, that is, the common method, it is to bring together the four edges, namely the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle threaded with a twisted thread of moderate thickness.  Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, return the needle from the side where you began.
So that the thread lies interwoven from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of a purse with which goods are tied.  And make the space between each stitch the width of the little finger. This stitching is known to all people.
With this stitching, a wound was sutured which appeared on the abdomen of a man who had been wounded by a knife. The wound was more than a span in length, and about two spans of the small intestine had protruded. The wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
I replaced it after its intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered. He then lived for many years, managing all his affairs, although the physicians had judged that he would never recover.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines. I used to apply old cotton wool to the wound twice a day, and I would wash it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to Galen's words: you begin the stitching from the skin, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.  When the needle has passed through the skin and the muscle, proceeding straight along the whole length of the abdomen…
…you leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle, and you pass the needle through its other edge from the inside to the outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum. When you have passed it through, pass it again through this same edge of the peritoneum from the outside to the inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it into the edge of the peritoneum on its side, until you have passed it through completely.
Then begin again from this same side, and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out of the skin near it. Then return it into that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
Bring it out from the skin on its side, and do that again, and do it repeatedly until you have sewn up the whole wound in that way. The general description of this stitch is that it is like sewing furs together.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of special stitch which Galen also mentioned, this is his exact statement:
That you sew it in the way that some physicians sew it, by bringing each part to its natural counterpart, and joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the muscle to its other edge; and that is as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the muscle nearest to you from the outside, and pass it to the inside in it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from inside to outside in the edge of the other muscle which is on the opposite side. This type of stitch is better than the easy common stitch, which is the stitch mentioned previously. This is Galen's exact words. Some have said that the suturing of the abdomen may be done with two needles. That is, you insert one thread into them both, and begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side, and pass it from your side, according to the seamstresses' stitching exactly.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suturing is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its treatment is the same as for other wounds. That is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestines and sew it and secure it, then apply the medicated lint to it.
If the wound has been altered by the air, then apply some of the ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the threads fall out and the peritoneum and muscle unite, then treat it as you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, apply to it from the time it begins to suppurate, used cotton, and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it heals. For you do not need other treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple.  If you fear that the wound will affect the principal organs with pain,
Then it is necessary to dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines – and this often occurs – then inject him with a lukewarm astringent black drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into his body. And know that what is thick from the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin from them is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs to it at all, because of the abundance of its veins and their size, and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. And as for if what emerges from the wound is omentum and you find it soft, then replace it according to your replacement of the intestine, equally.
If a period of time passes and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for in the omentum are veins and arteries, then cut below that ligature.
And make the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.  Mention of the wound which occurs in the intestine: And as for if a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small…
Then it is possible that it will heal in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind emerged. So I treated him although I did not hope for his healing. So I continued to treat him gently until he healed and the place joined.  When I saw that the place had joined, I feared for the patient that a bad incident might occur to him in his abdomen, but no bad incident occurred to him at all and he remained in the best of his condition. Correctly he eats and drinks and copulates and enters the bathhouse and exerts himself in his service. And some experienced people have mentioned that whenever a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
And it is that large-headed ants are taken, then the edges of the wound are brought together, then one of them is placed, its mouth open, on the edges of the wound. When it has seized and tightened its mouth, its head is cut off, for it will adhere and not become undone, then another ant is placed near the first.
And you continue to do that with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and suture the wound, for those heads remain adhering in the intestine until the intestine heals and the patient is not harmed at all.  And it is possible that the intestine may also be sutured with fine thread.
That which is drawn from the intestine of the animal adhering to it after it has been entered into a needle is that the end of this thread from the intestine is taken, then it is smoothed, then a fine twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is entered into the needle. And in it is the intestine thread, and with it the intestine is sutured, then it is returned to the abdomen. And this type of suturing with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the perforation is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy and no healing at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
In the treatment of the cold and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and longstanding and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus that does not stop, is generally called, in whatever organ it may be, a fistula; and we call it a cold, and a fistula.
It is in reality a complex, adherent, hard, white mass with no pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and it is sometimes moist, constantly discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture is interrupted; and this moisture may be much or little, thick or thin.
And I have already mentioned in the classification, when discussing wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is due to one of nine reasons: one of them is either due to a deficiency of blood in the body, or to its poor quality, or because inside it and on its edges there is hard flesh that prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is very dirty and foul; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material it discharges is of poor quality; or because the medication is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a general epidemic that has occurred in the region; or because of a specific characteristic of the region.
Or because it is very dirty and foul; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material it discharges is of poor quality; or because the medication is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a general epidemic that has occurred in the region; or because of a specific characteristic of the region. As happened in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because there is one or several bones in it. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medication in the classification.
It is appropriate here that I inform you of the treatment of fistulas and abscesses which is done by hand. Know that fistulas may occur in all parts of the body; some of them end in large veins and arteries or in a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the compound joints, such as the hand and foot; and some lead to the vicinity of a principal organ, and so on.
Those fistulas of this kind are among the difficult-to-cure diseases, whose treatment is laborious and requires knowledge. If, however, the fistula has not reached the locations I have mentioned, then there is hope and expectation for its treatment.
And if you wish to know this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula is straight, examine it with this. If the fistula is tortuous, examine it with a probe of thin lead, for lead is soft.
It will thus pass easily when entering and bend towards the tortuous part. If the fistula has many openings which you cannot discover with the probe, inject one of its openings; then the moisture which you inject will pass towards the other openings and flow out.
Then thoroughly investigate in any way possible to ascertain whether there is bone or nerve, whether the bottom of the fistula is near or far, or whether it is a single fistula with many openings.  Ascertain all this to the best of your ability by questioning the patient and observing the pain when your hand probes the area.
And similar signs and causes of the tumor.  When you have ascertained all this with certainty, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  This is to observe whether...
the fistula is superficially near or in a safe place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as previously described and remove any adhesion, diseased flesh, and excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening, such as flesh or a wart, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and straight, you should incise it as deeply as possible, then cleanse it of all diseased flesh.
Then use a pledget soaked in strong medicine and insert it to the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument; do this repeatedly until the strong medicine eats away all the remaining corruption in the bottom of the fistula.
Then dress it with ointments that promote healthy flesh growth until it heals. If it does not heal in this way, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then probe and incise it as I have told you, unless something prevents you from…
a nerve, or a major organ as we said. If the bone is exposed and there is some corruption and blackness in it, scrape it until the corruption is gone, then treat it with something that will heal it until it heals.  If it does not heal and pus continues to form as before…
know that you have not completely removed all the corruption.  Expose everything again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability, then dress it. If it heals, otherwise know that the corruption is in a deep recess. Expose everything again.
and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability. If the diseased bone is small and you can remove it, then remove it with delicate forceps suitable for this.
If there are many bones, thoroughly remove them all and do not leave any behind to the best of your ability. If something like ligaments obstructs you, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and the flesh, if it is there, and remove the bones.
If you are unable to remove the bones at that time, apply something to the wound that will cause it to decay and leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around the bones decay. Keep the wound from closing, the incision you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, apply cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments decay and the bones become loose, it will be easy to remove and extract them.
If it is a single large bone, such as a bone of the leg or thigh, and so on, and only its surface is diseased, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and decay disappears, then dress the wound.  If a large part of it is diseased and the decay has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to remove it.
And cut it all away to where the decay ends; then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about a case of gangrene that occurred in a man's leg, to serve as an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause that moved within his body until the matter reached the leg and swelled into a large tumor, and there was no external cause. Then time passed with the mistakes of the doctors until the tumor opened.
And a great deal of matter flowed from it, and he was mistreated until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and bodily fluids. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them were skilled in the craft of surgery.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in a great stream, and the man's body was emaciated and his color yellow. So I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found that some led to others from all sides of the leg.  So I began by incising one of those openings until I uncovered some of the bone. And I found it decayed, eroded, blackened, putrefied, and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow. Then I excised what was revealed to me.
And I removed the decayed bone, and I thought that there was no decay in the bone other than what I had cut and excised, and that I had eradicated it. Then I set about closing the wound with cauterizing medications for a longer period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again beyond the first uncovering.
And I found the decay connected to the bone. So I excised what was revealed to me of that decay also. Then I attempted to close it, but it did not close nor heal. Then I uncovered it again, and I continued cutting the bone piece by piece and attempting to close it, but it did not close, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I closed it with medications, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition in its operation and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness and his low tolerance, and my fear for his death, for he was subject at all times to severe fainting from excessive vomiting.  Then he recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and in walking he suffered no harm whatsoever. If a bone in a place of the body is broken,
then it is necessary to pull it apart in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it to the end of the protruding bone, and you instruct someone to pull it upwards, and you make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then you tie it to the flesh under the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, and you expose the flesh from the place which you want to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh, and you place a firm board or plank under the bone from below.
For if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the decayed bone.  And it is necessary that the sawing be slightly above the place of decay, lest there be decay in the cavity of the bone which does not appear on its surface to the touch, so that you are compelled to saw it a second time.
If the bone is decayed and is not protruding but its parts are connected to one another, and the decay is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides, then place the board underneath, then saw it from the first side where the decay is.
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the decay, as we said. If the decay is in a joint, cut the decayed joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but excision. If the decay is in the metacarpus of the hand or foot, the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the decay however it appears to you, and excise it and cleanse it in any way you can.
And by any means which straightens itself for you, provided that a vein or nerve does not impede you. And know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the position and setting of the bones, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, and their hardness and porosity. Therefore, for each type of work, one should prepare an instrument suitable for that work.
Know that the operations themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because it is the skill of the craft and the witness to types of diseases. He may devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I am depicting for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.

In the amputation of limbs and the sawing of bones.
Limbs may become putrid, either from an external cause or from an internal cause. If you treat that corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing hindering it,
it is necessary to amputate that member to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great affliction which is greater than the loss of the member. And a sign of this happening to someone is that the member becomes black, until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may become putrid after the blackness, until that putridity spreads to what is next to that member and attacks the whole body.  Therefore, hasten to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some venomous creature, like a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or the sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  Likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, cut it off from the origin of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it attacks the forearms.
Likewise, if it has taken hold in the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption progresses and you see it has reached towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient, and use other treatments as much as possible.
And similarly you do with the leg: if the corruption takes hold in the toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to leave it and surrender the patient to death. The method of cutting off or excising a member is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut and tie another ligature above the place.
And one assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards, and you yourself expose the flesh between the ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or excised; and it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy area, which would cause the patient excessive pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the area or apply some styptic powder, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about an example of this same affliction which appeared in a man’s leg:  that is to say, there appeared in his leg blackness with burning resembling fire.
And that corruption first appeared in his toe, until it took the whole leg.  So the man, of his own accord, when he saw the corruption spreading in the member, with the severity of the pain and burning, cut it off at the joint, and healed.
Then, after a long time, that same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand.  He came to me, and I tried to repel that corruption with the medicines I applied to the hand after cleansing his body. But the corruption was not repelled, and it continued to spread into the other finger.
Until the corruption seized the hand. He urged me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to repel the corruption, and also fearing for his life if I amputated his hand, because the man's strength was failing.  When he despaired of me, he went back to his town.
Then I heard that he himself had cut off his entire hand and healed.  I have recounted this story to be of help in cases of this kind of disease, and to be an example to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter eighty-eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and the method of injecting them with medicines.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy members, and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers matter, then bursts or is lanced, and all the matter that was in it comes out, and the place remains empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a rag, thinned, and its corruption has not reached the point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament.  From this it deserves to be called a fistula, and it is not called a sinus unless its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects something of these members.
Then it is called a sinus or a fistula, and its treatment is to cut all that skin as it goes around, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and its corruption has not reached that point, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection. This is that you look at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and becomes the consistency of honey. Then take what you need from it and thin it with water and honey, and inject the fistula with it, and bind its mouth, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then you remove it by pressing; you do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the foul smell is gone.  It may also be injected with ash water if this medicine is not available to you. This is that you take the ash of grapevine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water on it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and a syrup mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and the syrup adheres to the fistula, especially if the syrup has a binding and drying quality. When you have done this several times and are certain that the corruption of the fistula has gone, then inject it with something that will grow flesh in it.
Such as taking some palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and an astringent syrup, or inject it with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have established in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the fistula is narrow and does not admit the injection tube,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a tent soaked in the Egyptian ointment or the theriac ointment until it widens.  Similarly, if the mouth is too wide, bring its edges together with sutures and leave only enough space to admit the injection tube, no more.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, incise it in the lowest part so that the pus will flow downwards, for if the pus is retained in the depth of the fistula it prevents the growth of flesh there.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as you wish, then raise the limb so that the pus flows easily, in whatever way is convenient, so that no pus at all is retained.
As for the cauterizing medicines which are applied externally to the fistula, and the method of applying them: take one of the cauterizing ointments similar to what you want, and spread it on a linen cloth; let the cloth be large enough to cover the whole fistula. Then cut with scissors opposite the mouth of the fistula a hole slightly larger than the mouth of the fistula; then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, the size of the hole, and place it on, keeping it away from the mouth of the fistula so that the pus may easily escape; do not remove the large cloth until afterwards.
several days; as for that on the mouth of the fistula, remove it at all times so that whatever pus has collected there may escape, and to see what kind of pus escapes from it, whether it is much or little, good or bad.
And also examine the fistula itself: does the patient feel pain in it or not, and is there swelling or not? If your treatment continues thus and you see that the matter which escapes is slight at the mouth of the fistula,
know that the fistula has adhered or is near to adhering; then dissolve it in a day or on the third day; and when you have dissolved the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment; if after a long time thin pus escapes from the fistula, do not despair of its closing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite; if after many days, non-laudable pus escapes from the fistula, know that the fistula has not closed; if the fistula is slow to close,
increase the drying medicines, and let the medicines be moist in consistency and dry in power, like palm ointment if excess of litharge has been added to it; and among the most effective things with which to treat it is to take palm ointment,
and dissolve it with rose oil and sprinkle on it old wine, moderate in consistency, then knead it with it and use it; and he may do this if palm ointment is not available to him: honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it, or take myrrh, aloes and costus, and grind them all together and sprinkle them on the honey while it is on the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and bind it on the fistula, or apply honey which you have cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle on it the drugs, and place on it the cloth and bind it.
Long zedoary, the root of the asphodel,  and powdered cyclamen and centaury may be used in such a case, singly or mixed; grind them, sieve them and sprinkle them on the honey which I have described, and use it; if the fistula persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And if it has affected the bones or the other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it as a fistula, as previously described.
Chapter eighty-eight.
On the treatment of the felon, the injured nail, the amputation of the superfluous finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is an excessive growth of flesh under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and it may grow in other fingers. If its duration is prolonged and its treatment neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it becomes putrid and foul until it eats away the root of the nail, and perhaps the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until it has a foul smell, and the tip of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes livid.  If you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective,
then it is necessary to cut off with an iron instrument all the excess growth that grows from the nail, and then cauterize the wound afterwards, for cauterization is very beneficial in this. But if the bone is sound and the nail is also sound,
and the angle containing the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and is pinching and injuring it, then it is necessary to place a thin pledget under the angle of the nail which pinches the flesh and raise it upwards and cut that flesh gently.
And you should apply to what remains of the flesh of the cauterizing corrosive drugs until it all disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals. But if the corruption has affected the bone, then it is necessary to cut off that bone and remove it, for it will not heal at all as long as there is a corrupt bone in it.
If you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or injury and severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then you should incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from above downwards, and be careful not to reach with the incision to the flesh under the nail, for by that you would cause the patient severe pain, and it would be a cause for the growth of excess flesh in the place. Then treat the area with what relieves pain.
As for the extra finger which grows in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bones in it, and it may have a nail, and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the finger joints. Those that grow in some of the finger joints do not move, and those that grow at the joint of the finger may move. As for those that are fleshy only, it is easy to cut them off, and that is to cut them off at their base with a broad scalpel.
As for those whose growth is at the root of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting them. As for those that grow in the finger at one of the joints, it is necessary first to cut their flesh in a circular cut to the bone, then to saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs to the fingers, some to others, this often occurs, and this is from what a person is born with, and it is at the healing of a wound or a burn by fire and the like.  Then it is necessary to incise that adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural form. Then place between them a pledget or a piece of lint soaked in rose oil, lest it quickly adhere, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
And likewise, if adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is suitable and corrects the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On cutting hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids are twisted, thick veins, filled with black, superfluous blood.  They occur in most parts of the body, most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of blacksmiths, bakers and porters. First, one should use strong rubbing of the body with black bile.
Then bleed the patient in the basilic vein. As for treating them with iron, there are two ways: one is to incise and remove the black blood; the other is to cauterize the vein and remove it entirely. As for incision, it is in this manner:  first bathe the leg with warm water well.
until the thick, turbid blood dissolves. Then bind the patient's leg from above his thigh to below his knee with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one, two or three places with a wide incision.
Then squeeze out the black blood with your hand from the lower leg upwards and from the upper leg downwards, until you remove the amount of blood you consider sufficient or what the patient's strength can bear. Then bind it and instruct him to avoid foods that generate black bile.  Repeat the purging and bloodletting.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient.  As for cauterizing it, it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair. Then take him to the bathhouse and bathe his leg in hot water until it reddens and sweats, or let him do vigorous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, heat the limb. Then incise the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel. Then open the skin with hooks and dissect the vein from all sides until it is palpable.
When it appears, you will see it is dark red. When it is freed from the skin, it looks like a tendon. Then insert a probe beneath it until it rises and emerges from the skin; suspend it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then make another incision near that incision, about three fingers' breadth away.
Then dissect the skin from over the vein until it appears. Then lift it with the probe as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially. Then make another incision, or many incisions if necessary.
Then dissect it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull and dissect it until it emerges from the second incision. Then pull it to the incision above it and do this until you pull it from the third incision, above all the incisions, until when all of it has emerged, cut it.
If it does not yield to traction and dissection, insert a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull. Insert the probe underneath and use it to guide your hand to each side until it emerges. Be careful not to break it, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to dissect it.
And harm will befall the patient from it.  When you have dissected it all, apply wool soaked in a potion and rose oil or olive oil to the site of the incisions, and treat it until it heals. If the varix is tortuous, with twists and turns in various directions,
and is not straight as we said, then it is necessary that you make an incision on it at each part of its twists and turns, then suspend it with hooks until you dissect it entirely.  Be careful when incising it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will be difficult for you to dissect it, so exert yourself carefully.
Image of the incision used to incise the varix:
Image of the blind hook:
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it have a sharp point lest it injure the vein. It should be thick, smooth, and curved, for if it is thin it will cut the vein with its thinness. Rather, it should have a good thickness, as we have said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the removal of the varicose vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the Arab lands, and in hot, arid lands with little fertility.  It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its development is due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
Just as living creatures and worms occur inside bodies, and the gourd worm and the worm that develops between the skin and flesh, the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area swells, and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or an animal, so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped with a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two dirhams, and tied, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
So, whenever something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder; do not cut it from its origin before it has all emerged, for if you cut it, it will retract and enter the flesh, causing swelling, infection in the area, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be carefully and gradually pulled until it is completely removed and nothing of it remains in the body. From this vein, some people may have something that is five or ten spans long.
It has been reported to me that it came out of a man twenty cubits long. If it breaks while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and probe it deeply along the body until all its material is emptied. Then, try to cleanse the area with medicines for a few days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, resulting in many openings.  From each opening, a branch emerges; treat it as we mentioned in the classification and as previously described.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that develops under the armpit, and is called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries "the cow's disease," because it often affects cows. It is a small single worm that develops between the skin and the flesh, and moves throughout the body, ascending and descending.
It is perceptible to the touch as it moves from one member to another, until it breaks through the skin at some point and emerges.  Its formation is from the corruption of some humors, as happens with worms, snakes, and pumpkin seeds in the abdomen.
The danger from its harm is that if it moves in the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it may break through it and emerge, destroying the eye. This occurs frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this should be done when it is moving and is perceptible to the touch.
It is necessary to tightly bind above and below it with a strong bandage, then incise over it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest danger, as we said, is its potential to damage the eye.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it.  The patient should be treated by purifying the body with purgative medicines for bad, corrupt humors, and should abstain from foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the gnawing ulcer.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafir*, is a pain that appears in some organs and then spreads from one organ to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the countryside. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short time, I saw that swelling moving along the ulna like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
When it moved from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that place and settled in the shoulder. Then, after a while, it spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that it circled her whole body, as I witnessed.
I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one organ to another. I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen people whose pain moved from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I could only explain it by the fact that the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and visible veins; therefore, that moving wind was perceptible.  It would not appear in this way in people of comfort, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels pain, and it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then bind above and below it with a bandage and incise it until that congested wind is expelled, and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by means of things that dispel and disperse winds, such as the seeds of the  *mentan* and *sakbij* and similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge. As for their differences according to their types, there are large and small ones; some are hollow glass, others solid glass; some have three points, others four.
Some have barbs, some have splinters. As for those according to the members in which they lodge, they are of two kinds: either the members are principal hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow lodges in one of these organs, and the signs of death which I shall describe to you appear, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for death will overtake its owner in most instances. But if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of a wound to the brain: if an arrow pierces the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, there will result from it a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness.
But if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of a wound to the brain: if an arrow pierces the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, there will result from it a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, mental confusion, vomiting, and sometimes blood comes from the nostrils or ears; sometimes speech is lost and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling gruel flows from the wound, along with a watery substance like serum.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow, if it has not been extracted.  As for the signs of an arrow which has struck the heart: if it is near the left breast, it will be felt as if it has been driven into something solid, not into something empty.
And sometimes the arrow will have a movement resembling the pulse, and black blood will flow from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting. Know then that death is inevitable. A sign that the arrow has wounded the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck swell, the patient's color changes, he breathes heavily, and he seeks to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the lower ribs, and there will be great difficulty in breathing along with severe pain.
He will sigh and all the muscles of the shoulders will move. If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain will follow, and blood resembling liver in redness will flow from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, something undigested from the food may come out of the wound.
And its effect is obvious. If the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes embedded there, and something like excrement, fat, or intestine, which has been perforated, comes out of the wound, then there is no hope of treatment or of extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine will come out.
And if something protrudes from it and the pain intensifies for the patient, know that he is doomed. As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg and similar organs, they are mostly unharmed.
When the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.  And I tell you some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows so that you may thereby be guided in your treatment. That is, an arrow once struck a man in the inner canthus of his eye at the root of the nose.
I removed it for him from the other side, under the lobe of the ear, and he recovered, and no harm befell his eye. I removed another arrow for a Jew, which had struck him in the lobe of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; the arrow had become hidden, and I only grasped its small tip which is attached to the shaft.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with a smooth, square iron head, lacking barbs. The Jew recovered, and no harm befell his eye.  I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian; the arrow was an Arabian arrow.
It had barbs, so I made an incision between the jugular veins; it had sunk into his throat. I carefully extracted it, and the Christian recovered. I removed another arrow for a man who had been struck in the abdomen; we judged that he would die from it.
But when thirty days or so had passed, and his condition had not changed, I made an incision over the arrow and skillfully extracted it; he recovered and suffered no harm. I saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then, after seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh. I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow; the wound had closed, and the arrow remained.  Her condition did not change, nor did she experience any harm in any of her natural functions.
I saw another man struck by an arrow in the face; the wound closed, and he felt little pain.  Many such cases occurred. I removed an arrow for a man from the Sultan's guard; it had struck him in the middle of his nose, inclining slightly to the right.
The entire arrow was embedded. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow. I explored it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. He felt a stinging pain under his ear on the right side of the incision.
I hoped that this stinging pain was from the arrowhead. I applied a dressing with strong drawing and ripening properties, hoping that the area would swell and reveal the arrow's location so that I could incise it. But nothing occurred to indicate that the arrow had reached that location.
I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  In the meantime, the wound closed, and the patient despaired of removing the arrow for a time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He informed me, and I applied a strong, corrosive medication to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it. I felt the thin end of the arrow that attaches to the shaft. Then I further opened the wound with that strong medication until the arrowhead became visible.  This took about four months.
Then, when the wound had widened and I could insert forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it would not come out. I continued to manipulate it and devise methods using various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with forceps, as shown in the last chapter.
The physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound closed, and the patient recovered completely, without any further harm. I tell you how to extract some arrows so that it may serve as a measure and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts and details of this craft cannot be grasped by description, nor contained in a book. Rather, the skillful craftsman infers from the little to the much, and from what is present to what is absent, and devises a new operation and a new instrument in strange emergencies.
If we turn to this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the members in which they are embedded in two ways: either by pulling from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, and those which are extracted from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, in which case it is pulled and removed.  If it does not yield to removal from the place where it entered, you should leave it for days until the surrounding flesh rots, thus making it easier to pull and remove.  The same applies if it is embedded in bone.
If it does not yield to removal, leave it also for days and try pulling and moving it every day; then it will come out. If it does not yield to removal after days, you should pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until you widen the space for the arrow, then pull and remove it.
If the arrow is embedded in the skull bone, and has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms I mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after days.
then attempt to pull out the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and does not yield to pulling, use the drills around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the wound until it heals. And if the arrow has disappeared into a place in the body, and is hidden from sensation, probe it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it with some instruments suitable for pulling it. If you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is neither bone, nor nerve, nor vein,
then incise it until the wound is widened and you can reach the arrow to remove it. If it has barbs, grasp them and free the flesh entangled in them from every side by any means you can.  And attempt, if you cannot free the flesh, to break the barbs and twist them until you free them.
And when you attempt to remove the arrow from any place, use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until you free it.  And be extremely gentle lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out. If you cannot manage it at that time,
leave it for days until the flesh around it putrefies, then return to it; it will then be easier. If bleeding hinders you, use what we mentioned in its chapter.  And take care to avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon and use skill.
By any means you can free the arrow, and let this be done gently and calmly and steadily as I described to you. And it is necessary for you, when you pull the arrow, to position the patient in the same position as he was when the arrow struck; this is more appropriate.
If you cannot do that, use whatever positions you can. As for the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either something of it will have emerged outside, or you will find the tip of the arrow by touch just under the skin, and see that it is protruding.
Then make an incision upon it, and let the incision be only as large as is needed for the forceps.  Then pull it; it will be easy to remove. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand in a circle until the arrow affects the bone and widens a space for itself, then pull it.
Otherwise, leave it for some days, then return to it until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in place, push it with it. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that cavity; the arrow will then easily come out. If the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary that you scrape away all the flesh in which the poison is, if you can, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the flank, and it is near enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision upon it, then make an incision, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then stitch the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like the beak of a bird; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp the arrow or anything, they do not let go.  Large, small, and medium-sized ones can be made, all according to the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.
Image of the hollow pusher:
Image of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like an awl to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and to push it.
Chapter ninety-five.
On the incision of veins.
The veins which it is customary to incise in the body are thirty veins, of which sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins which are behind the ears, known as the "al-ḥasīsayn", and the two arteries which are in the temples, which are apparent, and the two veins which are at the corners of the eyes, known as the "al-nāẓirīn".
And the vein which is erect in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins which are in the neck, and the two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins which are in the lower lip—these veins are known as al- jahārik—and the two veins which are under the tongue.
And as for the veins which are incised in the arm and hand, they are five veins: one of them is the cephalic, which is from the lateral side, and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the median cubital, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the basilic, which is situated on the medial side, and it is also called the axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen; and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, and it is that to which it adheres, and it is that which appears above the thumb clearly; and the "asīlim".
And it is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one of them is that which is under the hollow of the knee from the lateral side; and the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel from the medial side; and the vein of the sciatic nerve, and its place is at the heel from the lateral side.
And in the other leg there are three veins like them. As for the two veins which are behind the ears, the benefit of incising them is for chronic colds, migraine, and favus, and chronic bad sores of the head, and the manner of incising them is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and to rub his head well in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins appear and their place behind the ears in the two low places of the head, then you feel them with your finger, and wherever you feel their pulse under your finger, there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet-like scalpel, which is known as the *nashshāl*, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone, then you raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and you cut the vein with the skin a cut that is severed, and the length of the cut is the amount of two joined fingers.
Or something similar, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal. And it was mentioned earlier in the beginning of the book their cutting and cauterization. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of incising them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors directed towards the eyes.
And the manner of incising them is as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch and their pulse is apparent under your finger, then at that time you mark with ink, then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the *nashshāl* scalpel from below and raise the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need, then you loosen the constriction of the patient's neck and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then you place on it cotton and a bandage and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.  And their mention, cutting, and cauterization were mentioned earlier in the book. As for incising the vein of the forehead, its benefit is after incising the cephalic vein for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and erysipelas.
And the manner of incising it, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears, then you take the instrument called the hatchet, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is in the head of the hatchet on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you leave the blood to flow to the amount you desire, then you loosen the constriction of the patient's neck and bandage it until it heals.
And it may be opened with a wide scalpel, except that it should not be sharp-pointed like other scalpels, but rather slightly wide-ended, and you incise it obliquely, because the bone is near, so the scalpel may break if it is thin.
As for the two veins which are at the temples of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, erysipelas, and blepharitis, and facial diseases. As for the manner of incising them, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you incise them while you are standing over his head, and let the incision be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly wide scalpel.
For the place has no flesh in it; if the scalpel is thin-pointed, it may break. Then you let out the amount of blood you need and place cotton on them and bandage them for one night, then you unbind them. As for the incision of the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and facial diseases such as the red erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  The manner of incising it is that the patient constricts his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long scalpel.
And you insert it into the middle of the nasal septum itself, between the nasal partition, straight, because the vein does not appear to the touch there. Then the blood will emerge immediately.  You should move your hand with the scalpel a little and let out the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it heals quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of incising them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, scabies, and bad ulcers and cankers.  The manner of incising them is that the patient constricts beneath them in his neck with a ligature and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you incise the vein lengthwise, a somewhat wide incision, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see as necessary. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the ligature.
And you tie the veins moderately so that the patient does not suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the temples, the benefit of incising them, after incising the cephalic veins, is that it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracking of the lips, and bad ulcers.
which are in and around the nose. The manner of incising them is that you seat the patient before you and tie his neck with a turban, then you turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left of it, and you distinguish them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins; so cut them with a cutting incision. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, then aim to cut the larger and more obvious ones. And likewise, do in the two veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of incising them after incising the cephalic veins is for the inflammations which occur in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.  The manner of incising them is that you seat the patient before you facing the sun, and raise his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color is toward blackness.
Then you incise them, and be careful not to go too deep in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps bleeding from those arteries will occur. As for the three veins which are incised in the elbow, they are those which custom has established for incising in all people, and their incision is in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, basil-shaped or olive-shaped lancet to the depth, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the *nishal* [and this is its picture], a picture of the wide basil-shaped lancet:
It is wide as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is a picture of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the point, suitable for incising thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is a picture of the *nishal* lancet:
This is the *nishal*, which is suitable for cutting, and there are types of it, wide and thin, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also. And one may infer from this (description) others (types of lancets), and it is well-known among the artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen.  It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when incising it, to be cautious and to be on the neck side of it, for beneath it is an artery; if he errs and goes too deep with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding will occur; therefore, it is necessary that its incision not be done with a lancet for puncturing, but its incision should be a cut with the *nishal*.  If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another (vein) or seek one of its branches.
Or you may incise in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and incise it with the *nishal* lancet as we said. If you wish to incise it itself, then before tightening the arm, it is necessary to feel the place until you identify the position of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you bind the arm and incise the vein with a sharp incision with the *nishal* lancet, as we said, and take care that the incision falls away from the position of the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the ligature, a swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see that the blood, upon incision, spurts like the urine of a boy, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery. Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops—and it often stops—then tighten the arm.
And leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be on his back and not move for days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and overcomes you and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly on the vein with a ligature and pledgets until the next day. If the blood stops, well and good; otherwise, treat it with what was previously mentioned, by placing styptics, and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature in the arm, inform him of that. As for the *akhal* vein, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the upper head and the lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
It is necessary for the one who bleeds him to be on his back when he bleeds him, for there is a nerve underneath. If he exceeds in the insertion of the lancet and injures the nerve, numbness occurs in it which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all. And this nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not discernible, then you should make your incision of it with a lancet, and avoid the nerve as much as you can. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the head.
It benefits from diseases of the eyes, and it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish to bleed it, to make the incision with an olive-shaped lancet or with a wide, basil-shaped lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery nor nerve beneath it.
Except that it is necessary for you, when bleeding, to avoid with the lancet only the head of the muscle and seek the soft place.  It does not harm him if he is not hit with the first blow to be bled again many times, except that perhaps it swells in some people if it is not bled in the first blow.
But that swelling does not harm him at all. As for the method of bleeding, its complications, and what should precede in its treatment, the first of that is that you should know that bleeding is either used only in preserving health.
And it is either used in illnesses. That which is used in preserving health and maintaining it, and in guarding against the occurrence of illnesses, is that the bleeding be in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, the median, and the basilic, and that the bleeding be at the beginning of spring if the signs of fullness appear.
And the bleeding should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed.  As for the bleeding which is used in illnesses, it does not have a limited time, but whenever necessity and need require it, whether by night or by day.
And at every hour and at every time.  And children should not be bled until fourteen years have passed for them, nor should old men who have passed sixty years be bled. If someone intends to bleed for any reason whatsoever,
he should cleanse his bowels before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained excrement in them, lest there be drawn into the veins, at the time of bleeding, foul matter from the intestines which harms the principal organs. And he should not bleed the feverish, the drunkard, or the intoxicated until that passes from them.
And let him also beware of bleeding after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive coitus, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then consider the thinning of the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
by means of foods, drinks, and medicines, if he is able to do so. Then let him enter the bath if nothing prevents him, or let him practice some exercise so that the blood is thinned, and let him make his bleeding in the middle of the day as we have said, and let him intend to free his chest that day from all bad psychological effects.
such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical effects like excessive exertion and labor, coitus, and the like. And let things be prepared for his session which people customarily use, from kinds of perfumes and aromatics and entertainments and the like, each person according to what he is able.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion which is higher than the cushion on which the patient sits, then he extends his arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with the forceps and twists it two or three times, and let the tightening be moderate.
For if the tightening is not moderate, either by excess in tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is towards relaxation, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then after the tightening, it is necessary that the patient rub both his hands together.
until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then he places the index finger of his left hand on the same vein a little below the place which he wants to bleed, lest the vein slips away and avoids the incision. Because some veins you find are like a tendon, they slip away during phlebotomy, and some are full of wind, so when the lancet is placed on them, they sink below the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it opens it, then its opening is narrow.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful and patient in all these matters, then he lowers the lancet; if the vein opens from that attempt, otherwise he repeats it another time a little below or above that place quickly if the place has not swollen.
If the patient swells or is frightened, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, for it may bring a hot swelling, and do not enter the bath, then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes. If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet to the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly, and do that quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you; place something of oil dregs on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood and it is better in this place than the oil itself and other ointments as well.
So use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies of the veins when the flow of blood is difficult.  The theriac and the shakhzanya may also do this, if one of them is placed on the place, for the blood thins and dissolves if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the phlebotomy—and this often happens, especially to one who has been phlebotomized only that once or whose vein opening was small—then act quickly and place on the swelling a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary to do that after the complete exit of blood from the vein itself or from another vein. If something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after days, it does not harm; if you wish, then apply something of aloes and myrrh that have been dissolved.
Or something of the juice of the *fudanj* and the like. Often a swelling and a pustule occur when phlebotomizing the basilica vein; place your hand on it, and if you find that it softens when you probe it, then that is a bad pustule, so beware of putting anything on it that we have mentioned.
For it may bleed arterial blood; but bandage it with something constricting to solidify the place, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.  It is necessary to remove from each person blood in proportion to his strength and what appears of the color predominating in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it come out until it becomes red; and likewise if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness goes away. It is necessary for someone who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood removed all at once…
…to widen the phlebotomy and the lancet to be wide. And for someone who is weak, the opposite. And it is necessary to remove it in stages and the hole to be narrow. And the best thing to use in phlebotomy is that which is sharp, honed, and slit, not punctured.
And this type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; and it is better and safer than phlebotomy across or lengthwise. And whoever is accustomed to fainting at phlebotomy, it is necessary to give him before the phlebotomy something of bread soaked in pomegranate juice or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is removed from him in three or four times, then if he is cold-tempered, let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in a drink of myrobalan or in a drink of honey sweetened with “afāwiyah” or in a fragrant basil drink.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the removal of a great deal of blood, it is necessary to give him meat broth and a light basil drink; and he should use perfuming with galbanum, and rub his chest with it; and use all that we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which is from vomiting. And as for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, it is necessary for whoever had his phlebotomy for copious evacuation and whose strength is weak, to let the blood flow little by little according to his strength on consecutive days.
And as for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again and his body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy. And as for whoever wants to draw the blood from his body to the opposite direction to which it inclined, it is necessary to relax him on the second or third day.
And as for someone whose body contains much blood, which has become hot and sharp and caused fever, it is necessary to remove blood from him in one go, and to remove a large amount, and to widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having observed all the conditions of phlebotomy. And that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, lest death occur instead of fainting; for this often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs.  And it is not necessary, if you want to loosen the arm and let the blood flow again.
And if the mouth of the vein is closed and the exit of blood is difficult, do not prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad; rather, either leave it until you phlebotomize it again, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has solidified of the blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or apply something of salt dissolved in water, or apply something of theriac or  shakhzanaya, and prick it gently until the blood comes out; and if the vein is swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides; and if necessity demands letting the blood flow again, then either phlebotomize above that place, or phlebotomize in the other arm or in another vein.
As for phlebotomy of the median cephalic vein, it is phlebotomized instead of the basilic and cephalic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.  And its method of phlebotomy is that the patient inserts his hand into hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature, a little moderately tight.
Then phlebotomize the vein slightly obliquely, neither across nor lengthwise, and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be a little above the wrist joint; and if the exit of blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer days, you may dispense with returning the hand to hot water, and the use of hot water is most often for making the blood flow in winter.  And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins. Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomy of the median vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the liver. And its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomy of the median vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the liver. And its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very perceptible to the touch. Then phlebotomize it slightly obliquely; and even if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all. Be cautious, do not thrust your hand deeply with the lancet, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, and the location is devoid of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it to flow. For if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will congeal in the mouth of the vein and cease to flow.  And when you have removed the amount of blood needed, place fat and salt on the vein lest it close quickly.
And similarly you should act with every narrow branch.  As for the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen; and you act in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, the same. As for phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit is for the diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus.
And retention of menses, and diseases of the kidneys, and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.  And its method of phlebotomy is that he inserts his leg into hot water and one rubs it until the veins swell, then you tie above the joint of the leg with a ligature, and the vein is located at the heel, on the surface, towards the great toe.
And many branches ramify from it on the surface of the foot. Therefore phlebotomize in its widest branch, or at the heel, where it joins; this is better and safer. For if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, be cautious of the nerves beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And make your incision as if you intend to sever it, and let the lancet be sharp. If the exit of blood is difficult, let him return his leg to the hot water, and leave the blood to flow until it is emptied. If the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt,
let him return to phlebotomize a little higher, for the place is safe, and no harm is feared from it if you are cautious of the nerve, as we said. And similarly you act with the saphenous vein of the other leg, the same.  As for the sciatic vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel, from the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the hip, if that is from excessive hot blood. And its method of phlebotomy is that you cause the patient to enter the bath, and hasten, and bind his leg from the hip to above the heel by four fingers with a thin, long bandage; for it does not appear except in this way.
Then, if it appears, phlebotomize it in any way you wish: either by incision, which is best, or you may sever it completely, or incise it; for its location is safe, and it is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it,
and it does not appear at all to the touch, then phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the dorsum of the foot towards the little finger and ring finger. And be cautious of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood that you desire.
Then untie the bandage, and place cotton on the site of phlebotomy, and bind the place; for it quickly heals.
Chapter ninety-six.
Concerning cupping and its method of use.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, brass, or glass; and cupping is of two kinds: one is cupping with incision and evacuation of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is of two kinds.
And the cupping vessels of the nape of the neck, which are the two sides of the neck on both sides; and the cupping vessels of the chin, which is under the lower jaw; and the cupping vessels of the shoulders; and the cupping vessels of the coccyx, upon the rump; and the cupping vessels of the forearms, which are the middles of the arms; and the cupping vessels of the legs; and the cupping vessels of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh; and for this reason, it does not weaken the body as bloodletting does.  Nor should cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be used in any illness arising from plethora, until the whole body is evacuated.
If cupping is needed because of illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle, or at any time.
That is because some people, when blood increases in them to the point that it needs to be removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache; and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck; and some feel itching in their face and sides, darkness and burning in their eyes; and some itch at the site of their cupping.
And some laugh excessively; and some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood; and some sleep excessively; and some see blood, redness, slaughter, and wounds in their sleep, and things like that.  When we see any of that,
especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water flowing into the eyes.
But it should be after emptying the whole body. This cupping may be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.  It is cautioned against using it for those who are cold-headed or have a cold, for it greatly harms them.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold illnesses in their heads should not use it, and those who habitually use it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the barber-surgeon to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little downwards, for fear of forgetfulness being generated.  As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, cough, and fullness. The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it benefits from pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and toothache. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. You should instruct the barber-surgeon not to deepen his hand with the lancet, lest he cut a vein and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth.  It may take the place of phlebotomy of the veins in the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations which result from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the inner aspects of the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins—the basilic, cephalic, and median—because it draws blood from all those small veins in the flesh, and it draws those small veins from other thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
You should instruct the barber-surgeon not to go too deep with the lancet, because the place is devoid of flesh and underneath are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping performed on the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
You should instruct the barber-surgeon that the cupping glass should be large and made of copper, because the place needs strong suction and a glass cupping glass might break and require many incisions. As for cupping the legs, it visibly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body, it benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it promotes menstruation; it benefits from boils and abscesses; and it takes the place of phlebotomy of the saphenous veins and the veins of the ankles, except that it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people.  The benefit of cupping the ankles is similar to the benefit of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and moderate suction is applied.  Do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but rather place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors may flow to the place evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see the area has reddened and opened.
When the redness of the blood appears, then you make an incision and gently resume suction. Then look at the condition of the bodies; if someone has loose flesh and porous skin, you should make only one incision, lest the place ulcerate.
Instruct the barber-surgeon to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to adjust the suction gently and with a light movement. If the blood is thick, then he should make two incisions; the first to open a path for the thin blood and its watery part, and the second to completely extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, repeat the incision a third time to achieve the goal. In short, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, one incision is sufficient; if we want to remove a large amount of blood, we make more incisions, especially if we estimate that the blood is thick.
It is necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin. What ointments and waters should be used when applying cupping glasses, and what the cupped person should avoid. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are tight,
Then you should anoint the places for the cupping glasses with opening, softening, and resolving ointments. If it is in the summer, then for example, with rose ointment, or violet ointment, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is in the winter, then like daffodil ointment, or iris ointment, or chamomile ointment, or lily and the like. If the waste is thick and cold, then let the ointment be marjoram ointment, or balm ointment, or benzoin ointment, or rue ointment, and the like.
If the cupped person has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided. These people should wash their cupping sites after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or gooseberry water, or pumpkin water, or chickweed water, and the like. As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cupping sites with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumac, and the like. As for someone whose waste products are thick, he should wash his cupping sites with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of rue, or chamomile, and the like. Cupping should be avoided in the bathhouse and immediately after the bathhouse.
Rather, it should be done an hour or two after leaving the bathhouse. No one should sleep after cupping. What the cupped and bled person should take care of before and after cupping.
First, it must be observed whether the cupped or bled person is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation predominate in his blood. Then he should take cooling things like pomegranate and chicory with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, and sherbet, and the like. And he should make his foods of small birds, lamb meats, stews and sour things, and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honeyed drinks and quince drinks, or seed oxymel.  And he should consume moderately aromatic wine, which is between old and new. And he should be instructed to eat little, and his food should consist of small birds, partridges, sparrows, and squabs, stewed. And the drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more than the food.
And it may be necessary to give some people at certain times some of the Faruq antidote, or musk medicine, or  shiltha before cupping and before or after bleeding, to strengthen the principal organs and to thin the blood. But it should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cuppings which are without a condition, they are those which are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, the region of the kidneys, and the hip joint; for these organs do not tolerate the condition being placed on them.  Rather, what is intended by them is either the drawing of blood from one organ to another.
Such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts in a case of epistaxis, or we use it to remove a cold humor which has settled in an organ, as when we place the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel; for it loosens the organ, warms it, and removes pain by resolving that humor.
And it may be placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stone in them, for by the force of its drawing it may perhaps open the obstruction or remove the stone from its place.  And likewise it acts if it is placed on the liver and spleen in the case of a humor which disturbs them. And these cuppings may be used empty, by suction only.
And it may be used with fire, and it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of inflammation; and this is done by filling the cupping glass, and let it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs suitable for that purpose have been boiled.
Then it is placed full on the affected area, held, and removed, and repeated several times according to need. And this is the picture of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its mouth should be the width of two open fingers, as we have depicted, and its depth half a span; and in its side, about the middle of it, there should be a small hole about the size of a needle's opening. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick edge.
Smooth, even, and polished, lest it injure the member when placed upon it; and in its middle there should be a transverse groove of copper or iron, where the lighted candle is placed. And this cupping glass may be made larger than we have described, or smaller, according to the diseases.
And the use of it is as follows: for the cupping glasses of children and thin people are not the same as those of men and stout-bodied people. As for the method of applying this cupping glass with fire to the member, it is that you prepare a burning wick of tightly-twisted linen or a small candle of pitch and place it on the middle of the solid rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the fire may ascend upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest it burn the patient's body. Then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole which we have mentioned; so that when we have held the cupping glass as long as we need, we remove the finger.
And the vapor will come out through that hole, and the cupping glass will adhere to the place. Then you prepare the wick in the same way and replace it if you need to. As for the cupping glass which is used in the disease of the shosha with water, it has neither a solid rod nor a hole.
But it is used by being filled with water and placed on the member only. And this is its form:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold more water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On suspending the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in cases where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of the small size of the member, such as the lip, gum, and the like, or because the member is devoid of flesh, such as the finger, nose, and the like.
And the method of using them is that you should choose leeches which are in fresh, clean water, free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and there is nothing left in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is placed upon it; and when it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, it is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and this is a trickle, then let a linen cloth be soaked in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle upon it powdered vitriol or alum or the like of astringents until the bleeding stops, or place on the affected area halves of peeled lupins.
And leave it until the lupin sticks to the place, for then the bleeding will stop. And it is necessary, if it is needed to reapply leeches, not to apply those leeches if others are available.  If the leeches refuse to attach, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle into the place until some blood comes out, then apply it; for when it senses some blood, it will stick in place. If you wish to make it fall off, sprinkle upon it something of aloes or salt or ashes; then it will fall off in place.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also includes what is needed in the art of medicine, which is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never examined the books of the ancients in it, nor read a letter from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become extinct in our country, and I have never encountered anyone skilled in it at all. And I have only acquired what I have acquired from my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted the knowledge of that from them, then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have drawn for you from that in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has followed upon it, after I have brought it close to you and freed it from the complexities of prolixity, and shortened it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and depicted for you in it many pictures of the instruments which are used in it.
For it is from the increase of explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Almighty.
Chapter One.
In it are summaries and generalities concerning the matter of fractured bones, and it is necessary to present them before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one.  Therefore it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter a summary of speech and sections. You will first be compelled to understand them and stand upon their truth, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that when a fracture, dislocation, contusion, or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him or purge him, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or if the one to whom this has happened is a child or an old, feeble man, or if the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then restrict his diet to cold vegetables and the meat of birds and gazelles; and forbid drinks, coarse meats, and overfilling with food, and every food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and the pouring of matter to the place is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen, which was his custom.  When the broken bone begins to knit, then the patient should nourish himself with foods that provide much thick, strong nourishment, containing viscosity, such as pottage, rice, heads, necks and cow tripe. And eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and the like; for by this regimen the consolidation of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and knit to their first nature.
Because of the dryness of their bones and their hardness. And it may unite and knit, what was of bones in the extreme of softness, in the manner of the bones of small children. But nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something resembling glue, in it is thickness that adheres to it and strengthens it until it binds one part to another.
And binds one part to another until it comes to the utmost strength and firmness as it was at first, until nothing hinders him from his actions.
For this reason it is necessary to give the patient foods which contain firmness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said. And know that fractures differ in their kinds according to the difference of the members, for a fracture of the bone of the leg differs from a fracture of the bone of the head, and a fracture of the bone of the chest differs from a fracture of the bone of the back.
And so are all the other members, each differing from another. And we shall come to the mention of each kind of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed from the others. And the kind of fracture of the bone may also differ in itself.
For it may be its fracture a splintering without fragments being produced in it, and it may be its fracture along the length of the bone and its fracture may have fragments and superfluous parts separated and unseparated. And the fracture may be with a wound and perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each kind there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And of what makes known the fracture of a bone is its crookedness, and its swelling, and its appearance to the sense, and its roughness when you touch it with your hand.
Then when there is not in the place an apparent crookedness, nor roughness, nor do you feel upon touching the bone a disturbance, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is not a fracture, but it may be a sprain, or a slight fracture, or a slight crack.  Therefore, it is not proper to move it at all by pulling or probing.
But apply to it of the medicines, the mention of which will come after a while, what suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is broken and cracked into two without fragments being produced in it except that each part has moved from its companion.
Then it is necessary for you to hasten at once to setting it and aligning it before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then set it in whatever way you are able with gentleness and skill.
And know that its setting and alignment is easier than a bone in which fragments have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned.  If there are fragments in the bone, then it is necessary to pull the broken member from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the member is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand. And let your placing of the member be on a level surface in its natural shape, until when the broken part of the bone is extended, then return those fragments to their places in whatever way you are able with skill and gentleness.
And strive with all your effort that you do not cause the patient pain or suffering by your action, and strive with all your effort to join one of the bones to its companion in the best manner. And it is necessary at that time that you touch and feel them with your hand; if you see there something contrary, correct it and align it to the extent of your ability.
And beware of strong pulling and forceful probing as many ignorant people do, and they often cause by their actions a hot swelling or inflammation in the member, as I have witnessed from their actions repeatedly.
Then after the setting, perfection, and binding, keep that member still and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it while awake or asleep, and when he turns and is restless, and when he defecates, and in all his movements to the best of his ability, and let him seek that the position of the member be a position in which he is safe from pain.
And that is because whenever he feels pain or suffering in the position of the member, he should move it to another position in which he does not feel pain, and he should strive that this position be level and straight.
Lest crookedness occur in the member if it is set, and as for the manner of binding the broken member, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken members differ in their smallness and largeness and their shapes; those which are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm and the like.
Then it is necessary that the bandages of the rags be soft and gentle, and those which are thick, like the thigh, back, and chest, then it is necessary that the bandages be wide and firm, for the wide bandage is necessary for the large member and tightens it from every side with equal tightness so that no defect intervenes.
Then, after you have finished the setting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. With a soft, pliable bandage on the place of the fracture, then you begin to wrap the bandage on the place of the fracture itself three or four times, according to what the member requires, and you tighten your hand slightly with the bandage, then you take it to the upper side of the place of the fracture.
With less tightening than your tightening of the broken place, then you spread the wrapping a little from the place of the fracture and loosen the tightening little by little until you take from the correct place something suitable, then you take another bandage and wrap it also on the broken place.
Wrappings, then you take the wrapping to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the wrapping be as we mentioned in the first upper wrapping, then you place between the wrappings of the soft bandage or rags what evens out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it, then you wrap another bandage around it, then you set on these wrappings the firm splints at once if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply what soothes that inflammation and removes the swelling, and leave it for days, then tighten the splints on it then; and let the splints be from broad, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be from sieve wood.
which are made from pine or palm stalks or willow or boxwood and similar things of what is available from that, and let the width of each splint be in this manner and this shape exactly.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb in its size and smallness.  Image of the splint:
Then you tighten the splints with another bandage, according to your first tightening exactly, then you bind from above with firm threads according to what we mentioned of the tightening, which is that your tightening should be more on the place of the fracture. And the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be moderate in thickness and thinness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant who make their threads from twisted linen strips, this is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you do not achieve with them the tightening you want, and there should not be less than a finger between the splint and the splint.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the healthy areas, then place under them soft tow or fluffy wool so that nothing harms him from that. As for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture in the skin occurs, we will mention that separately.
And know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, and that if the limb is large, then the splints should not be placed on it except after five or seven days or more, depending on your assurance that hot swelling will not occur.
And this is the description of the bandages which the ancients used to bind with, which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains; a description of a general, brief bandage which sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is something which is not overcome by heat or cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the essence of the flour which adheres to the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone, then knead it as it is without sifting it, with egg white, and make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
The description of another bandage which sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  Take of mastic, leadwort, acacia, orris root, gum tragacanth, and sugar, ten drachms of each; and of myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; and of the lote tree, twenty drachms; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything and mix it with the water of the lote tree or with egg white if the temperament of the patient is hot; then use this bandage, for it is good in composition, sets broken bones quickly, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
The description of another bandage which is also useful for fractures and sprains: Take gum tragacanth, mastic, and white lead, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white, and use it.
The description of a bandage for joints and bones which have shifted from their places, and which alleviates the pain affecting them, and for bone fissures and fractures: Take carded wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the affected area. This bandage does not have the power to set (bones).
But it is excellent in alleviating hot swelling and relieving pain in particular. The description of another bandage which sets broken bones: Take the leaves of the black fig and the leaves of wild poppy, and pound them together and apply them moist. The description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is healing.
And if you want to resolve the rest of the swelling, take of the root of white lead, chamomile, violet flowers, and crushed acorns, one part of each; pound everything together and knead it with white of egg if the member is not hot; but if it is hot, then knead it with coriander water or with water and use it.
The description of another bandage stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs during the healing of a bone: Take of the root of white lead, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, germander, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound everything together and knead it with vinegar or with fresh water or with white of egg, all according to the heat of the member and the stillness of its fever. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when setting it.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he saw that things which contain dryness with some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and the like that we have mentioned, should be placed on the broken member when setting it.
The description of a bandage which is useful for weakness and pain: Take of myrrh, alum, human hair that has been cut or bird feathers, white lead, and salt, equal parts; pound, sift, and knead, and bandage with it. As for the amount that the bandage should remain...
Then it is loosened; that is to say, you should look: if there is no pain or itching in the afflicted part, and the broken bone has not moved from its place, do not loosen it for many days. But if there is severe itching or distressing pain or swelling in the place.
Then hasten to loosen it at once and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the place with it until the itching and pain subside, then let the member rest for an hour.
Then apply to it carded wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night, until you are safe from hot swelling, and the swelling of the member subsides, and its pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as you did at first.
And treat it gently until it heals.  If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and inflammation, and all the symptoms have gone completely, and you need a bandage and tightening, then renew it as you did at first, the same. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the member.
Then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days; and it may be left for twenty days; all this according to what appears to you of the condition of the member, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh begins to knit around it.
Then also increase the tightening more than your first tightening, and also increase the nourishment of the patient more than what was mentioned before. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried out and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and lessen the tightening a little. For by this action, nourishment will flow to the member, and it will heal quickly. As for what the ignorant among bone-setters do, of breaking the member again,
if it is not set properly at first, and is set crookedly, that is a mistake in their action and a great deception. And if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it, and I have seen no trace of it at all from any of them. And the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
Concerning accidental fractures in the head.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and this may either sever the bone entirely until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone. As a wedge does in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a wedge fracture.  Alternatively, the sword may cut some of the bone and sever only its surface, without the cut penetrating to its end; this type of fracture is called an absolute extraction.  The wound in these two fractures may be either large or small.
Some fractures are comminuted or contused, caused by a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, nearly reaching the membrane under the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound in these two fractures is also either large or small.  Some fractures are hidden in the bone, fine as a hair, being a slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairline.  Another fracture is caused by a fall or a blow from a stone or the like, which drives a section of the bone inwards, creating a depression in the area, similar to what happens to a copper pot when struck, causing a portion of it to cave inward.
This occurs most often in the soft bones of the head, such as the heads of children. All these types of fractures may have loose or non-loose fragments. We will discuss the treatment of all of these in their proper place, and we will identify all these types of fractures by examining them.
And examining them with probes and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hairline type, it is identified by examining the bone, wiping it, and applying ink; the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of the fracture, first look at the patient's symptoms.
If you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, sunken eyes and redness, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable with these symptoms in most cases.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.  If the injured person comes to you immediately after the injury, and this is during the winter…
you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case.  If it is in the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone is corrupted and those symptoms we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and bruising, you should cut away the crushed and bruised part as I will describe to you.  This is to shave the head of the injured patient.
And uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, when you uncover the bone, you find bleeding or hot swelling, treat that as necessary.
This is to pack the area with cloths soaked in a potion and rose oil, and cauterize the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then you begin to rasp away and remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
The first method is to cut the bone with a fine saw with a narrow blade.  This is its image:
Then you use another saw, slightly wider than the first. This is its image:
Then you also use another saw, wider still than the second. You should have several saws of different sizes, some wider and some shorter than others, and their edges should be extremely sharp.  Let them be made of Indian steel or good quality steel.
Use gentle pressure on the saw so as not to shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, it is necessary to drill holes around it before using the saws, with the drills called non-penetrating drills.  They are called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not go beyond the skull bone to what is behind it, since the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, preventing it from penetrating and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that for every skull you have a drill whose sharp point is appropriate in length and shortness to the thickness of that skull. This is an image of three types. Of the drills: large, medium, and small.
As for how to drill around the fractured bone, you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the drill to another place, making the distance between each hole about the thickness of an awl or similar.
Then cut between each two holes with the cutters, doing so with the utmost gentleness as we have said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with another instrument prepared for that purpose.
Such as rasps and delicate forceps. You should be very careful that the drill or cutter does not touch anything of the peritoneum.  If the bone is scraped clean and freed from the peritoneum, if it was attached to it, and you have removed it, then you should cleanse it.
And smooth the roughness remaining on the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be finer and more delicate than the other cutters. If anything remains of small bones and splinters, take them gently with the instruments you have.
Then treat the wound afterwards with lint and the ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other method of treatment, it is a very easy method, far from danger; Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly. This is what he says: First, you should begin by uncovering the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious, until, when you have uncovered that part, you place under it the tip of this lenticular cutter, and this is its image:
Its lenticular part should be smooth so that it does not cut anything, and its sharp part should be on its sides extending lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the sharp edge of the cutter is against the bone; then strike the cutter from one side.
With a small mallet, until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, with nothing frightening happening to it at all, even if the surgeon were the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If anything of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular cutter itself and carefully remove it, for it will be removed without harm or fear.
But if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane, and what is broken of the bone is its surface, and roughness and small fragments remain in it, then you should remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, several of which have been made of different sizes, so that you can use the most appropriate and suitable ones for each place, according to what the work requires.
And the same broken bone and its shape.  You should first use the widest of those forceps to clean the bone, then use a finer one, and continue to do so successively until you come to use the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like cracks and slight fractures, you should use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its healing; this is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the least skill in this art and has understood what we have written and explained about larger fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do this as gently as you can, so as not to weigh down the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure the hot swelling has subsided, then unwrap it and afterwards use medicines which have a drying effect, such as iris roots, crushed costus, powdered spikenard, zedoary, and the like.  You should make a powder from these medicines.
And sprinkle it dry on the wound. In short, use a medicine that cleanses without stinging, and make every effort during your treatment of the wound to keep it clean, free from grease and dirt, and do not let pus collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, causing great harm to the patient. This may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If blackness appears on its surface, and the patient shows the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he will inevitably die. However, if the blackness is caused by a medicine applied to it, and it was in the nature of that medicine to cause that blackness,
then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, and smear a cloth with them, then apply it to the peritoneum and treat it with the appropriate types of treatment until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the reduction of a fractured nose.
Know that only the upper two parts of the nose, or one of them, can be fractured, because they are bone; the lower part is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but rather is subject to bruising, bending and flattening.
If one of its parts is fractured, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and set the fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until you restore the nose to its natural shape.  Let this be done gently, taking care that your actions do not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, it should be set with the end of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do likewise.  And let it be set on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after seven or ten days when the acute inflammation has subsided. Then insert a pledget of linen into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two pledgets if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the pledgets be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early bone-setters mentioned that the pledgets should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not think so; rather, the pledgets should be moistened with egg white mixed with ground barley.
Then leave the pledgets until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  Goose quills, wrapped in soft linen, may be inserted into the nose at the site of the pledgets; this will provide stronger support for the fractured nose and prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not necessary; you may do it or you may use pledgets. If acute inflammation develops in the nose during treatment, apply a compress of  kyrios  or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or some diachylon ointment.
If no acute inflammation develops, dress the outside with fine semolina and powdered costus mixed with egg white, and then apply a soft bandage. Do not bind the nose at all if the nasal bones are only slightly fractured.
Or if they are shattered, you should incise, remove the fragments with an appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with appropriate ointments that promote healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, treat it with pledgets and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of lower jaw fractures.
If the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then if the fracture is only external and not broken in two and is not depressed inwards, its identification is easy.
If the fracture is in the right side, then the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is in the left side, then the index finger of the right hand should be inserted and gently lift the prominence of the fracture from the inside outwards.
With your other hand outside the bone, control and straighten it. If the fracture of the jaw is broken into two, then traction should be applied from both sides to straighten it until it is set. If a displacement has occurred in the teeth.
Or if they are separated, then tie what you expect to remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread. Then place a pledget on the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth over the pledget, and then place over the cloth a tight, large splint, or a piece of leather the length of the jaw. Then bind it from above according to what seems suitable to you and agrees with its setting, so that it does not become dislodged, and instruct the patient to remain still and quiet, and give him soft liquids as food. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then hasten to unbind it on the third day.
Then bind it from above according to what seems suitable to you and agrees with its setting, so that it does not become dislodged, and instruct the patient to remain still and quiet, and give him soft liquids as food. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then hasten to unbind it on the third day. Then repair the dressing with mill dust mixed with egg white or semolina flour after removing the pledget, and place a soft pad over the dressing. As long as the dressing adheres and the condition of the bone does not change, leave it.
Do not unbind it until it heals and the fracture consolidates; this fracture often consolidates in three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during that time, use what we have repeatedly mentioned to calm it until the swelling subsides.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, look: if a bone splinter or splinters have separated from the bone, gently remove those splinters with whatever instrument suits you for removing them. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as you need.
Then, when you have removed those splinters and none remain, stitch the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for it. And suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of a fractured clavicle.
The clavicle most often fractures anteriorly at the acromial end, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks into two without splintering, which is easiest to set;
or splintering occurs in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound. If the fracture is without a wound, the treatment is to have two assistants, one to hold the arm on the side of the fractured clavicle, the other to extend the neck toward the other side.
Then set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is no prominence or deformity. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.
The size of the ball should suit your needs. Extend and elevate the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set properly. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward because it is deeply impacted, the patient should lie on his back.
A moderately sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downward until the impacted clavicle rises. Then set and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle is broken and moving, you should incise over it and remove the fragment gently. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, try to cut it with one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument that protects the pleura, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a handle.  Its width should be according to the size of the bone, and its length according to what is convenient for the procedure. Let it have two ends, as you see; one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound made when removing the bone fragment is wide and you are certain there is no risk of inflammation, close the wound edges with sutures. If the wound is small or you fear inflammation, treat the wound with lint and pledgets according to the size of the incision.
If inflammation develops, wet lint in rose oil and vinegar or syrup and apply it. As for setting a bone without incision or wound, apply a plaster made from mill dust and egg white. Place a soft pad over it, then place a ball under the armpit if necessary. Then take a very long bandage, about a cubit wide, and apply a folded pledget over the pad and plaster.  Then take a splint of thin wood. Let its width be three fingers and its length the same, then wrap it in a cloth. Then insert that cloth with the splint into the part of the bandage that lies over the fracture, then tighten the bandage over the fracture as you would wrap it. And pass it over the neck and under the sound armpit and under the affected armpit, and repeatedly pass it to each side, as you see fit, so that the binding firmly fixes the fracture, which is not hidden from you.
The whole point is that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then have the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit at night.
So that his arm is raised from his side, thus raising the clavicle fracture with the raising of the shoulder, or bind his arm to his neck, and do not untie the bandage unless an incident occurs in the area such as itching or swelling, for twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. And leave it bandaged until the clavicle fracture heals and consolidates, and it becomes stronger; this takes about twenty-eight days. And in some people it may be less than that.
Chapter Six.
On setting a fractured humerus.  The humerus rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, it fractures at its extremities.  If a part of it is fractured or it is fractured in its middle, this is known by touch, and the method of setting is according to the nature of the fracture.
Set it and restore it to its natural shape by every means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft tow, and place over it a pad of folded cloth; then apply a broad splint of wood.
Thin enough to encompass the whole shoulder or slightly wider. If, under the splint, there is a prominence in any part of the shoulder, level that prominence with soft tow so that the splint lies evenly, then bind it above with a long bandage.
Bind it firmly and ensure that the splint does not move from its place. Examine the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place. Let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days.  When this time is completed, unbind the bandage, for you are then safe, for it is among the bones which are not to be feared for shattering or displacement. If a splinter of bone protrudes and is pressing under the skin, incise over it and extract it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle to calm the hot swelling, if anything of that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of a fractured rib.
The rib may be fractured in its middle, though this rarely happens; but its ends are more often fractured and shattered.  Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there is intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And perhaps blood is expelled, and the depression in the broken bone is apparent and not hidden from the touch. Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed down, and the ribs are gathered together by the hands from both sides, and he is gently straightened in every way that is possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be, then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint made from a thin, light board of willow or elm, or something similar, after wrapping it in cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone lest it shift, and pass the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it firmly, then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity dictates its removal because of suppuration that occurs in the area, or pain, or swelling, then proceed immediately to its removal, and take off the bandage and treat what has occurred, according to its treatment, then reapply the bandage if you see fit. And face [the patient] and keep him firmly bound until he heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of broken ribs. Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick parts which are next to the spine, and their extremities in front are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous, and the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense upon examination with the fingers.
And set it by straightening the fracture with the fingers in the best way possible, until the shape is as it should be, then bandage and bind the broken bone with a splint if it is needed. If the fracture of the ribs is inclined inwards, then intense pain occurs to the patient.
And it is depressed like the depression which occurs to one who has a puncture wound, because the bone depresses the diaphragm, and there also occurs to him shortness of breath, coughing and the ejection of much blood, and this is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many stratagems for it.
And some of them said that it is necessary to give the patient foods which generate flatulence and wind so that the abdomen swells and expands, and the fracture is driven outwards. And we dislike this lest it be a confirmation of the occurrence of hot inflammation, if it has not occurred; and if it has occurred, then it increases it and confirms it.
And some of them said a cupping glass should be placed on the place, then sucked strongly, and this is more like the reasoning, except that it is feared that the cupping glass draws humours to the place in its weakness. And some of them said that it is necessary to cover the place with wool which has been dipped in hot oil.
And a pad is made between the ribs until it is full, so that the bandage is level when it is wrapped around in a circle. Then the patient is treated with the treatment of a puncture wound, with regard to food and medicine, if a severe matter burdens the patient which he cannot bear. And the bone was depressing the diaphragm with a harmful depression, and we feared for the patient; therefore it is necessary that we incise the place and uncover the broken rib, then we place under it the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which has been previously described, and we cut the bone gently and extract it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and we treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot inflammation appears in the meantime, then act quickly, and wet pads in rose oil and place them on the place, and treat the patient with what calms the inflammation from the inside as well.
And he lies on the side on which sleep is easier for him until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
In the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens to them, and what most often happens to them is a contusion, and so too the vertebrae of the back—then if this happens to someone and you want to know whether it will heal or not heal, look; and if you see that his hands have become relaxed and numb and dead, and he is unable to move them or extend them or flex them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that in most instances he will not heal, and he is doomed.
But if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the marrow of the bone has been spared and that the patient will heal with treatment.  If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you want to know whether it will heal or not,
look at his legs; and if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and feces pass involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine passes involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed, so do not trouble yourself with his treatment.  If nothing of this happens to him, the matter is less serious, and the treatment of what has happened is that you seek to alleviate the hot swelling.
by placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks; apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply one of the strengthening, drying poultices to the area, bind it tightly, and order him to rest and remain still.
He should not sleep except on the side where he feels no pain, until he is healed. If, at the time of the injury, a splinter or something has broken off from the bone, then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with sutures, and then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the end of the sacrum, is broken, then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
and set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as you can manage and the setting allows; then apply a poultice and splint if needed, and then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound as described above until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is in such a way that the ends are shattered and the bone is split lengthwise, leaning inwards.  The patient experiences pain at the site, swelling, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then set that fracture according to whatever setting seems suitable to you, until its shape resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has leaned inwards, lay the patient on his stomach so that you may set the fracture.  Once you have set it, apply a bandage, then place a splint of wood or leather over it and bind it tightly.
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or the splint coming loose. Fill the hollows in the hips with something to make them even so that the binding is straight. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his sound side. If he develops a hot inflammation,
desist from setting it until the hot inflammation subsides. Apply something to soothe it as described above, then return to setting and binding it as appropriate. If there are splinters or shattered fragments of bone at the ends, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched, but smoothed from the outside as we have said, and the binding left in place until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth, curved splint of moderate thickness, in this manner:
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is suspended from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the splint until his armpit is touching the middle of the curve of the splint, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with his two hands until he reduces the fracture as it should be. The other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is suspended from his neck with a bandage.
Then you instruct two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, each pulling in his direction. And if you wish the traction to be stronger, then tighten a bandage below the fracture and another above it, and each of the servants pulls in his direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other end below the fracture towards the elbow.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then you bandage it if there is no hot swelling. If there is hot swelling, then leave bandaging it until the seventh day, and apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bandage it. The method of bandaging is to apply the compress to the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the compress, then bind the forearm to the arm itself, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And you apply the cloth and bandage to the arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as splints, if nothing prevents you and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something will change, then use splints.
And that is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint. And let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then you bandage the splints with the bandage I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your bandaging should be tighter at the site of the fracture.
And the farther from the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be. If you see that placing the splints and bandaging as we said is suitable at the time of your setting the limb, then do so.
And if you fear hot inflammation, leave off the bandaging and splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there be chafing or swelling at the site, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive tightness.  Amend all this as we have mentioned.
But if you are confident that none of this will occur, do not unbind the bandage except after many days.  The patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a moderately full bolster of wool should be placed under the armpit.
And examine at all times, night and day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disarranged, or the bandage become loose.  Amend all this with your effort. And let the patient's diet be in the order we presented, that the food should be light at first, until the bone begins to knit.
Then it is proper to strengthen his diet. For it is the habit of the arm and leg to knit in forty days. Then it is proper to unbind and use the bath and treat with ointments suitable for this. If the fracture is severe and comminuted,
do not unbind the bandage until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
In the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the ulna. One is small, which is next to the thumb, and the other is large, which is situated beneath the small one from below. Perhaps the larger ulna is broken alone, or the smaller alone, or perhaps both together.
If the smaller upper ulna is broken, then its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. If the lower ulna is broken, then its fracture is bad and its healing difficult.  The worst is if both bones are broken. If the bone that is broken is the smaller upper ulna,
the physician, when setting it, should make its extension easy and gentle until he straightens it. If the larger ulna is broken, then he should make its extension firmer. And if both ulnas are broken, then he should make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, be placed on a pillow; and the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient should sit squarely upon himself.
And let the pillow be in front of him at the right height, lest the patient suffer hardship.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends it from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he restores it to the best shape he can. If there are fragments in the broken bone, then they are removed.
Return each fragment to its place to the best of your ability. If a fragment appears that is detached and is piercing the skin, and you have no hope of setting it, then incise it and extract it in the manner we described before. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then it has been given a separate chapter.
Then take its treatment from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a cloth with qirūṭī mixed with rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the cloth on it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the qirūṭī and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints; and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture was in one forearm or in both forearms together, then make your binding on the place of the fracture stronger and tighter. And whenever you move the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding somewhat looser, as was mentioned before at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, and not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of special linen, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we described. And examine the limb and the binding after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as itching that appears in the limb, then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water until that itching subsides. And leave the limb unbound for a night so that it may rest, then resume the binding.
If the binding has become loose and the bone has shifted or something like that, then correct all of that with your effort. And look also, if the nourishment prevents reaching the limb because of excessive binding, then it is necessary to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
If nothing of what we mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be undone except after twenty days or so. Then, hang the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight. And let him carefully avoid agitated movements, and let his sleep be on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that depends on the states of the temperaments and the states of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
Fractures rarely occur in the metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers; rather, contusions frequently occur.  So when a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand…
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a chair directly in front, level with him.
Then he places his hand upon it outstretched, and then the bonesmith straightens the broken bones, and the physician sets them until they are properly set. Then a bandage and splint should be applied, unless a hot swelling occurs. Then a splint is applied over it to fit the area.
And it is inserted into a soft rag. If the fracture is towards the bottom, towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball from a rag and tell the patient to grasp it with his broken hand; then tighten it with a long rag.
And let the splint be of supple leather, so that it conforms to the skin with the bending of the whole hand, and tighten it as necessary. If the fracture is outward, then the splint should be placed above and another splint below in the hand so that the hand remains open and upright.
Then the bandage is applied as the hand rotates, and the fingers are interwoven with the bandage. If the fracture affects one of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as necessary, then bandaged with the hand; and if you wish, make a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, then straighten them and bind them with the next sound finger, or bind them all together, which is better, or place a small, upright splint on them.
As we said for the thumb, and examine during and after your setting for hot swelling; then counter it appropriately whenever anything of that occurs, as repeatedly described.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the setting of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone frequently breaks and is perceptible to the touch because it moves forward and backward. Its setting is done by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, the patient lying on his face.
Then each assisting bandage is extended to its side evenly. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  But if it is near the head of the femur, then it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either of wool or similar.
At the head of the femur towards the pubis so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well. Then it is necessary to apply the bandage and tightening, if a hot inflammation does not occur in the limb. But if inflammation occurs, leave it for some days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for its tightening, it is necessary to wrap a firm, wide turban around the fracture two or three times, and what remains is left. Then the leg is twisted until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and a long thread is passed between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread are brought up from both sides.
Then wrap what remains of the turban around the leg and thigh. Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and place one splint on the leg bone. Then fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.
Then begin strong tightening from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns. And the further the bandage is from the site of the fracture, let your tightening be less, gentler, and looser.
Then take the ends of the thread that you had passed between the thigh and leg, and tie with it the splints above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot, and with them also tighten the ends of the splints from the other side.
Lest the bandage shift from its place. Then leave the tightening on it as long as no inflammation, swelling, or puffiness, and the like, occurs in the limb. If any of that occurs, quickly loosen it and correct whatever occurred, as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a protruding splinter in the bone, it should be set if possible. Otherwise, incise over it and extract it, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals.  This fracture of the thigh may be tightened without the leg being added to it with splints.
As we mentioned in the case of the humerus and forearm, except that its setting in this way does not result in lameness for the patient. But if it is set alone without the leg being added, the patient will inevitably be lame.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less, all according to the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but contusion occurs frequently. If a fracture does occur, it is either a fissure or a shattering into fragments, and this occurs with or without a wound.
You ascertain all this by touch, and you treat it by aligning the separated fragments with your fingers until they are joined and united, as far as the alignment, gentleness, and skill allow; then you apply a bandage and a circular splint if needed.
And you tighten the appropriate bandage above, then you treat all the conditions which we described in other fractures, such as hot inflammation and the like, by countering each symptom with what is suitable for it until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula; and they are subject to the same types of fracture as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as the treatment of the arm, and the procedure is the same. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, and this happens in the lower part, then this is something that is not hidden from you.
So use traction and alignment, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the fracture of the leg is a severe one with many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and you should take great care in its treatment.
And in the treatment of the leg there is something in addition to that of the arm: when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two splints of pine wood, the kind used for smoothing rooms, which are placed between the cracks of the boards, or they may be made from palm leaves or something similar.
Choose those that are of moderate thickness, not thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one with two layers of cloth along its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side.
Let them extend from the knee to the bottom of the foot, then bind the splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle. By this means, the leg is prevented from tilting to the right or left, and it is well supported. A wooden gutter along the length of the leg may also be used.
It is placed in it to keep it from moving, and it is most necessary to do this in fractures when there is a wound, especially. Then examine the leg every day and treat it with great care regarding swelling, inflammation, or anything else. When anything of that sort occurs, counteract it appropriately until it heals.  The bone of the leg knits together in about thirty days, or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the fracture of the bones of the leg and toes.
As for the heel, fracture never occurs there at all. As for the bones of the leg, fracture may occur to them.  The toes also rarely fracture; rather, contusion occurs to them in most instances.
If a fracture occurs to the bones of the leg and you see that some of those bones have overlapped, then let the patient place his foot flat on the ground upright as when walking. Then you should place your foot on what has risen of those bones, then press down on it and align it.
Until they return to their places, then apply a bandage and splint from above, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot.  Then bind the foot firmly after wrapping it with cloths and whatever else it needs.
Then if three or four days have passed, untie the bandage. You will find the bones straight, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure, as you see, is as follows. As for if one of the toes is fractured, set it and align it according to what I described to you in the setting of the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured toe along the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it. Then place under the foot the board that I described to you and bind it firmly. If what was fractured of the bones was two or three or more,
then make for each toe a splint of its size, wrapped in soft cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot.  Let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we mentioned to you in other fractures, from the symptoms that we mentioned, and treat each symptom as it should be.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then gently incline her backwards. Let her be held from behind, then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball within her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her loins are raised little by little.  That cotton will come out until it is at the entrance of the vulva like a ball, and the fracture of the bone will return [to its place]. Then a pad is placed on her back. When she wants to urinate, the cotton is gently removed so that she may urinate.
And it is returned in the manner in which it was first inserted, then she returns to her first position.  She does this for seven days or so, then it will knit together. And if you wish, you may take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube to its mouth, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; then the fracture will return [to its place]. Then pack it with cotton and remain as we have described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this is used in its setting.
And its setting is as we described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure for these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for one who has some experience and understands this book well, will not be hidden from you, for the fracture itself will indicate to you, in most cases.
Understand the correct way to set and bind it. As for the penis, if it is fractured, take a goose's gullet, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it, bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the setting of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, like the thigh bone or the humerus or similar, should immediately be bled at the appropriate time if the conditions for bloodletting, as we have previously mentioned, allow it.
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available. Then set the fracture that very day and do not delay it.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if a hot swelling does occur, delay setting it until the ninth day, until the hot swelling subsides, and do not touch it at all on the third and fourth days, for it will lead to bad consequences.
If the broken bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, you should try to gently reduce and align it with your hands with a slight pull. If you are not able to reduce and align it with your hands, reduce it with this instrument, which is made of iron and is seven or eight finger-widths long. And its width is according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture.  Let them be rounded and slightly thick, so that they do not bend when pushed during use.
And let the tip be sharp, with a curve at its end, and let the upper part be thicker, and from its middle to the lower part much thinner.  This is its image:
And it is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  Its sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone, and it should be pushed with it until the bone returns and is somewhat aligned, then align the ends of the fracture with each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then the end of that bone should be cut until the instrument can grasp it. If you are not able to reset the bone in the way we described at all, then cut it with a similar cut to those we mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, however you can. Then remove any roughness and thin scales remaining on the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient experiences severe, persistent pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, then do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have completed the setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any ointment or anything containing fat to the wound.
Lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it. Then apply the splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
And beware, with all caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death, or gangrene, or tetanus. Let your tightening be gentle, loose, and contrary to the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels disturbing pain in the place, then you should not apply splints, but make bandages for him from strong cloths in the place of the splints, and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you placed on it with the drink, then use lint and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and the like. You should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and is cured.  It is necessary to position the limb so that the pus flows downwards easily. If many days pass and the wound does not heal and the pus does not stop, then know that there are small fragments of bone.
Then you should probe the wound with a probe; whatever of those fragments is loose, remove and extract it; and whatever of them is not loose, and is causing pain and injuring the limb, remove and extract it by any means you can.
If the wound shows signs of gangrene, or ulceration, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should counter each symptom with a treatment similar to that described in its chapter.
And what you should note and keep in mind is that if a large bone is broken and is sticking out of a limb, such as the femur, humerus, and similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or remove it. For death often results from such an action; rather, leave it until it putrefies, and perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see there is a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of complications which arise after some fractures.
This complication often arises after the healing of a fracture, especially one near the joints, and disfigures the limb and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
Observe; if the complication is fresh, use astringent medications such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gum tragacanth, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, or with egg white, or with vinegar.
Apply it to the complication in a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then unbind it and reapply another until, God willing, the complication disappears. Or bind a tight lead plate to it.
For lead has the property of removing all that is superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has become hardened and severe, and necessity compels its removal, incise it from above and cut away the superfluous growth, or scrape it off with some scraper until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the treatment of a fracture if it is set but the limb afterwards remains thin, contrary to its original nature.
If a bone fracture is set, but the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, this is due to many causes. One [cause] is either from excessive loosening and tightening of bandages, or from excessive tightening of the bandages such that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, or from excessive and repeated rubbing, or from excessive movement at an inopportune time, or from a deficiency of blood in the patient’s body and weakness.
The treatment of this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until his blood increases, and to use the bath and to make him happy and joyful and so on; then apply pitch to the limb, for the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or continue rubbing it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of fractured bones which have been set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a projection of the fractured bone, or a complication appears, and the appearance of the limb is thereby disfigured, unless the limb is prevented from its natural function; then it is not proper to accept the opinion of those who claim that the limb should be broken from the head, as many ignorant physicians and bone-setters used to do in our country.
And this action is greatly blameworthy, leading to great danger, the least of which is injury; but if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be softened with water in which emollient herbs have been cooked, such as mallow leaves and root, and rosemary, and the like.
And it should be bandaged with emollient bandages, like well-made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and beaten with chicken fat and lard, and bandaged with it; or ripe figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon dung and the like of medicines which are called resolvents.
And sometimes the complication is resolved by constant gentle rubbing with the hands, and the movement of the limb in every direction at all times is employed; but if the crookedness is old and severe and hardened, and the necessity for its treatment with iron arises,
then it should be incised above and the connection of the bone loosened, and what remains of the complication or bone should be cut with delicate cuts, and gentleness should be employed therein with effort and care; then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, which hinders movement, disfigures the limb, and causes the patient severe pain and suffering.  If a dislocation occurs, one should immediately attempt to reduce it.
One should not delay at all, for if delayed, the area will swell and become inflamed, making reduction of the dislocation more difficult.  Therefore, one should not delay, nor move or stretch it while it is swollen, because this often causes the patient spasms and harmful pains.
But if this occurs, one should immediately bleed the patient, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat, then bathe the limb in warm water and oil, then gently reduce it, and treat each limb as described in its appropriate section.
The chapters on dislocations are also arranged, as with fractures, from the upper body to the lower.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
It is rare for both jaws to be dislocated. Their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced and relax a little, or they are completely dislocated and relax completely. toward the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot restrain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue is impeded in speech.  But if its dislocation is slight, it often returns of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, it should be reduced quickly and not delayed at all.  A servant should hold the head of the patient, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
or he should insert both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from outside to adjust them. He should instruct the patient to relax and release his jaw to go to every side, while the physician adjusts the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, apply warm water and oil compresses until their reduction is facilitated. Do not delay their reduction at all, as we said. When they have returned and are straight, and the patient's mouth is closed and they are not relaxed, then apply compresses of cloth with a poultice made of wax, oil, and rose water.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head raised between two pillows, lest he move it to the right or left, and let him not attempt to chew anything, but let his food be soft gruel.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is firmly set, then let him eat whatever he wishes, but let him do so gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is firmly set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they become dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, fevers and persistent headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's abdomen will become distended, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile. If you see this, then know that it is damaged.
And many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On the reduction of a dislocated clavicle and shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate inwards because of its connection to the chest; it may dislocate outwards, and this is apparent to the touch.  Its reduction is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Then press the area firmly with your hand, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and supports and tighten them. As for its end which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it rarely dislocates; but if it does dislocate, it should be reduced and set as we have described and as seems best to you.
Then apply a bandage and supports and tighten them, and instruct the patient to remain quiet and still until it heals. By this same treatment, the head of the humerus is also reduced if it leaves its place.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one, towards the armpit and downwards; the second, towards the chest; and it may also dislocate upwards towards the shoulder, but this is rare.
It does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder blade, nor forwards because of the nerve; most often it dislocates and goes downwards towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, because it quickly exits and quickly enters in them.
But as for those whose flesh is abundant, it is otherwise, that is, it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.  And sometimes a blow or a fall happens to some people, so the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, and they think it has dislocated. It is necessary to examine this until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed to its treatment.  And the dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit, for if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find the head of the shoulder in it twisted, and under the armpit, on palpation, the head of the shoulder like an egg.
And the patient cannot raise his hand to his ear nor move it in all its movements.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that clearly evident on palpation, not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place your thumbs under his armpit and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place, and the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lowers it downwards, and it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been for many days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use things that relax and soften, such as cooking the root of marshmallow, fenugreek, and rue in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool which is moderate between soft and hard. Then the physician places his heel on the ball and grasps the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, then it returns to its place. And if you wish, reduce it in this way: you bring a taller man than the patient and position him on the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards his belly. If the patient is light, then something else should be hung on him to weigh him down, then the jaw returns immediately.  It may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to fix in the ground a long piece of wood, its head round in shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin. Then it is placed under the patient's armpit after placing a soft rag on the head of the wood, and the patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he also extends his body from the other side forcefully, then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: you take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers, and its thickness is about two fingers. It has a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit in this manner:
Then a soft rag is tied to the round head so that the wood does not hurt the patient. Then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a horizontal beam. The arm is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. Then the joint enters immediately.  If it enters in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder as it rotates from above. Then the ball is firmly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is rotated over it from above, and his hand is suspended to his neck.
He is left without moving his hand for seven days.  The patient's food should be limited so that the limb may strengthen, for this speeds its healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is untied and exercised. If it is stable and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three cautery irons should be used as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days and the joint is not stable,
the bandage and binding were repeated many times, but it did not stabilize, and it fell and relaxed, and you could not raise it upwards, then know that the nerve in the head of the shoulder has been severed, stretched, or relaxed. Then know that the joint will never stabilize in its place.
As for the fracture that occurs towards the chest and breast and towards the back, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.  All the binding and treatment are used until it heals. If after healing there is stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement,
the patient should use the bath repeatedly until that stiffness softens and returns to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of a fracture of the elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty also. It dislocates in all directions, especially forwards or backwards. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is under sight and touch, to whatever form it dislocates.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, that will be clearly apparent to you by the deformity of the joint, and he cannot bend the arm nor touch his shoulder with it.  And you should hasten and reduce the dislocation at once before a hot inflammation occurs to it.
For if a hot inflammation occurs to it, its reduction is difficult, and perhaps it will never heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards, for that is the worst of all types of dislocation, and the most painful, and often death follows it.
And its reduction, if it is something that can be reduced, is that a servant extends his hand with both his hands and his arm extended, and the physician's hands are above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both his hands, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And as for if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the hand once until the base of its palm strikes the corresponding shoulder.  If the dislocation does not return to its place, then use very strong traction, which is that two servants extend the arm.
And two servants also hold the patient so that he does not move during the traction, then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around his hand. And when the physician touches the joint with his hands, he should lubricate them with oil so that it will help in easily sliding the joint.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns. After its return, a bandage should be applied to it, which contains constriction and drying, along with egg white, and it is tied tightly. The arm is then suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is untied. If the joint is stable in its place, then untie the bandage and leave it. And if you see that the joint is not yet firm, then reapply the bandage and leave it for some days until it becomes firm, then untie it. If swelling occurs after the return of the joint and its unbinding,
and difficulty in movement, then use moist applications in the bath and gentle massage and manipulation until it softens, or place a fat ram’s testicle on the joint, then bind it and leave it there for a day and a night, then remove it and have him enter the bath. When he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the testicle once, twice, and three times with the bath until it softens. And if you wish to apply a moist, light ox-bladder with fat and bind it, do so repeatedly, for it will soften and return to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, except that it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it dislocates, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot inflammation appears.
To reduce it, place the patient's wrist on a board, and have an attendant extend his hand; the physician should place his hand on the prominence of the joint and push it until it returns. However, it is necessary to observe whether the dislocation has moved towards the palm of the hand.
Then let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, let the palm of the hand be placed on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the prominence of the joint itself. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, bind it with a bandage that is soothing to the inflammation.
And leave it; do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after several days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked, and it will not harm the patient except if the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised; there is no remedy for it except cauterization, which may or may not help. When the reduction of the wrist is completed, apply the bandage that we described, then tighten it and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and there is any stiffness in it, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter twenty-nine.
In the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction. If a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns. Then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day. If it is at night, bind it in the same way, but continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals. Do likewise if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death quickly overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's stool is involuntarily passed; he is unable to retain it, and often some of his limbs, either his legs or his arms, or one of them, become relaxed. But if only one vertebra is displaced, it often returns to its place.
And its displacement is in four directions; that which is displaced backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, if the hump has occurred from infancy, there is no treatment for it, nor is there any recovery at all. But that which has occurred from a fall or blow, or the like…
The ancients have mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are not beneficial. I have abridged this, taking what is sufficient from their many approaches, drawing closer to the meaning and explaining it, and depicting the instrument differently from what they have shown and described.
I say that a hump which occurs in the front of the chest is incurable, and so is one on the sides. Only that which occurs in the back is treatable, in the manner I shall describe. It is to extend the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a wet cloth beneath him so that his chest is not hurt. Then place a vertical wooden post fixed in a hole in the ground at one end of the bench, towards his head, and another wooden post towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the post—let it not be firmly fixed in the hole—and another servant holds the other post in that manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, strong bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the post at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips and above his knees and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other post at his feet. Then each servant pulls his post with the bandage, and the two posts do not move from their fixed positions.
except that they are not firmly fixed, as we said. And the physician places his hands on the hump forcefully until it returns, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three cubits long.
and make a hole in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, into which the end of the board is inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until he presses the hump.
and it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a hand-turned screw, then you drive two posts into the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop, a cubit long, and at his feet at the end of the shop also two posts.
Let the distance between each post be a span. And a hole is made in each post through which the screw passes, and all the wood is firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. And insert a round stick, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two posts.
And at its end is a hole in which a stick a span long is firmly fixed with what is twisted, and in the other two posts the same. Then you tighten the bandage which you tightened on the chest of the patient in the screw at his head, and the bandages which you tightened on his legs in the screw at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, turning his hand with the wrench with which he turns the screw, and the physician straightens the hump as we have explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then after the vertebra returns and the place is straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying bandage with egg white, then lint, then place on top of the bandage a splint of wood whose width is three fingers or so, and its length is as much as the hump takes up.
And on some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he is healed. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with using the splint we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used for that. And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it may be thought to be a dislocation, and it may be an extra bone that has protruded. Do not treat it with this treatment, for death may result.
Chapter thirty-one.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to other joints of slight displacement and depression. The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
That is, it dislocates inwards, outwards, forwards and backwards. Most often it dislocates inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards. The sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the diseased one, it will be longer.
And the knee will be more bent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area near the groin will be noticeably swollen, because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation outwards is that its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms. And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he wants to walk, he cannot do so forwards.
And he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking, his weight is on his heel. And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin. As for the reduction of this type of dislocation, you should look; if the dislocation is old, it has become chronic with its owner and he has not attempted to reduce it, and it remains in its state, then there is no treatment at all.
Then you should not attempt it.  As for one whose dislocation is recent, and whatever its type may be from among the four types of dislocation, hasten to twist the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; perhaps...
it returned and did not need other treatment. If it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong, capable assistant who will extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant who will extend it from above.
so that he inserts his hands under his armpits, then tightens a soft bandage on the root of the thigh, and another third assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the extension will be either from the front, from the side of the groin to the side of the clavicle, or from behind to the side of the back.
And their extension will all be at once, until the patient is raised from the ground with his body and remains suspended.  For this type of extension is a common type for the four types. If the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type needs the special treatment that I will mention.
As for its special reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, then the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage is applied to the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the place under the groin.
Then the bandage is extended upwards from the groin towards the upper body to the clavicle, then another strong, capable assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced. If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then you should bind both legs of the patient with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees.
And the distance between each one and its neighbor will be about four fingers, and the affected leg will be extended more than the other by about two fingers. Then the patient will be suspended by the head from a wooden beam in the house, and his distance from the ground will be about two cubits.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy will hang onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the thigh pushes forcefully, then the joint returns to its place quickly. As for its special reduction, if the dislocation is outwards.
The patient should lie on the bench as we described for the humpbacked person, and the bandage is tightened on his affected leg especially, and on his chest. Then the two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head. Then an extra piece of wood is placed in the middle of the bench, firmly secured.
A wet cloth is wrapped around it so that it does not injure the patient. The wood is placed between his thighs so that he does not slip downwards when pulled. Then each servant pulls towards his side, and the physician adjusts the hip with his hands; if it responds to reduction,
otherwise, place the board on him and compress it as we mentioned in the case of humpback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended once while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand. With that, he makes the pressure extended downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backwards, the patient should not be extended downwards.
He is raised off the ground, but rather should be placed on something solid, just as it should also be if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench on his face, with the bandages tightened.
as we said before.  It is also necessary to use compression with the board on the place to which the joint has gone. When the hip joint is completely reduced as it should be—and the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you; it is that you extend the patient's legs—
If you see them even, and the patient bends and straightens his leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should. Then bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and bind it firmly with a turban so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days. Then loosen the bandage and dressing, and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in size, know that the reduction is secure, and allow the patient to walk. If you see some laxness in it,
then re-bandage and tighten it as you did before, and leave it also for three days. Then unbind it, and let him walk slowly on it for days until it is strong, God willing.
Chapter thirty-two.
On the treatment of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards, that is, backwards; it is never dislocated forwards.  The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all types of its dislocation is that you seat the patient sitting with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and bend him slightly backwards; then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands, interlacing your fingers on his knee; then you press with your hands strongly on both sides of his knee, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly and without force. Then bandage it and bind the leg to the thigh, and bind them both together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  He should only walk a little for a few days until it strengthens.
If you are unable to return it by the method we described, then use strong traction with the bandages that I previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be slightly dislocated, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inwards or outwards. The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent towards the side to which it is dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight dislocation, it is easy to reduce it; this is done by gently stretching it with the hands and straightening it until it returns. As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, then the patient should sit, and a strong servant should hold him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand and then with your left hand twice, then stretch it with your left hand and push the front of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without force.
Do this twice as we have described, then push the front of the foot to the leg on the third occasion while you pull at the heel. If it returns in one or two times in this way and you see the foot is straight, otherwise repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and plant a strong, firmly fixed peg in the ground so that it lies between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it so that it does not hurt the patient, then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant stretches the leg, either with his hands or with a rope tied around the leg's neck. Then each servant stretches in the opposite direction to his companion, with the peg standing between the patient's thighs, holding it so that his body is not pulled downwards when stretched, then the physician straightens the joint with his hands.
And another servant holds the healthy leg downwards, for the joint returns quickly. When the joint returns and you are sure that it has returned correctly, then apply the bandage and splint, and tighten it with firm bandages, and tie the foot with the bandage below; and you should be wary of the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
lest the bandage be too tight and hurt him. Then leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day, and the patient should abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be certain that the joint will not become dislocated and spoiled and will not then accept treatment. If a hot swelling appears, you should use what we have previously described in other places of treatment and poultices to soothe it until it disappears.
Chapter thirty-four.
On the treatment of a dislocated toe.
You should set what is dislocated with a gentle pull without force; this is not difficult, but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the joints of the instep, the patient should place his foot on a level surface.
Or on a board while he is standing as if walking; then you should place your foot on the dislocated joint and press down firmly with your foot until it returns and you see that it is straight and there is no prominence in the area.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot that encompasses the whole foot and has two ends, then bind it tightly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and the return is prevented, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
When something like that happens and you attempt its treatment and setting, it frequently results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skillful in the art, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, not rash nor impetuous, and that he should use in the beginning only medicines which calm hot swellings, and leave the patient alone.
To the extent that God wills, except that which you hope for safety from harm, with mildness of the disease and you see in it some hope, then restore it at once at the first, before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to what you intended, then use the treatment that calms hot swellings and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments.  If the dislocation is with a fracture and splinters are detached in the bone, then remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases, which preceded in their places.
And strive your best and refrain from entering the path of risk, according to my previous advice to you; that is more secure for your reputation and safer for your honor, God willing.
