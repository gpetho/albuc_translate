of the pain that comes from flatulence This disease is called in our land "wandering pain", and it is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb; and I saw what I tell you.	On incision for the disease known as 'flitting disease'. The disease known in our region as 'the flitting disease' is a pain arising in a limb and then passing from limb to limb.	0.8000517
I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm; and a little after, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another; the pain left that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm; then she told me that it always turned around the body, as I saw it.	I have personally seen it as I shall describe to you: I was called to a woman patient in a country district, who uncovered her arm and showed me a small inflation of the cephalic vein. After I had waited a while I saw the swelling creep like a worm along the forearm, ascending towards her shoulder, with the greatest possible speed, as of quicksilver running from place to place. Then the pain left that place and settled in the elbow. Then I waited a while and the pain ran through the whole body until it reached the other arm.	0.8930565
I was very surprised how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this disease in this manner.	I was amazed at the speed with which it migrated from one part to another, as I had never before seen this disease in this form, though I had seen many who had a pain that passed from limb to limb; but never with my own eyes had I seen anything like what I saw in this woman.	0.76703954
However, I had often seen that pain could move from place to place, but I had not seen it like I saw it in the woman; and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins prominent, and because of this, this constrained flatulence appeared; and it does not appear in this way in those who are overweight and who have moist bodies and hidden veins.	The only opinion I could form of it was that it was due to the woman's being of the dwellers in the wilds, dry of body, with outstanding veins, and hence that moving vapour was perceptible. But it follows then that it does not appear in that manner in people leading a leisured life, with humid bodies and hidden veins.	0.73831314
And when you want to treat this disease, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then tie it above and below quickly, and then cut on it until this constrained flatulence comes out of the place; and cauterize the place; and if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with that which expels flatulence, such as fetid pills, and pills of sagapenum, and other similar things.	When you want to cure this, and the patient feels the pain of it, and if you observe the appearance we have described, then tie a bandage round above and beneath it as quickly as possible and cut down on it so that the vapour enclosed there may come out; and cauterize the place. But if there is nothing visible to you then treat by purging of the body and by medicines dispelling and getting rid of flatus, such as foetid pills and pills of sagapenon and the like.	0.8924539
