Of fleshy hernia
Watery hernia is nothing other than an accumulation of moisture or white syfac, which is under the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg; and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is actually in the tissue of the egg, so one thinks it is another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white syfac we mentioned; and this rarely happens.
And the generation of this hernia is from the weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either it is a color leaning towards jaundice, or it is red blood, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often;
and these are the signs to recognize this accumulation, because if it is in the white syfac that we mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because it has moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the actual tissue, the abscess is round with part of the egg, and therefore one thinks it is another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white syfac, it can be felt well; so when you want to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, the form of which is mentioned before.
According to what comes out after the probe, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with surgery, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body; then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and place many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and command the assistant to sit on the right, and stretch the penis to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles;
then take the blunt spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles along the length until near the base, and make the cut straight dividing the skin of the testicles until the white syfac, and peel it gently according to your ability;
then pierce the syfac full of water with a large opening, and extract all the water, and then use your forceps, and stretch the syfac upwards; and do not touch the skin of the testicles, but only the syfac; cut it all or in pieces, especially the side of it gently, because if you do not cut it well, the water will return;
and if the egg comes out during your work, put it back in its place when you have completed the work on the syfac; then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture, then treat it as other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted with another disease, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood; then cut the testicle with the suspensory, and extract the egg, and treat it as we have said.
And if the water is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two hernias; then cut the other part as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
and put outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it on the two testicles, and put over doubled cloths, and tie it all with a bandage in this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with teased wool according to this design and sew them together at the waistband of the pants, and one end takes the area from the perineum to the back, and the other to the base; and the other two ends on the two sides, and all the tightening should be assembled in the buckle of the pants;
and sometimes this hernia is treated with a cautery instead of an iron cut, and it is that you take a subtle knife-shaped cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and heat it as we have said, so that the white syfac containing the water is exposed;
then take the cautery in this form, and pierce the syfac with forceps, and peel it with this fine hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you scrape it all; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg; and know that this procedure is safer; and more protective against blood flow, and better than the cutting procedure;
and if anything opposes you, whether it is a hot abscess or blood flow or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what is said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not want to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I told you, and it is that when you are very sure by the signs we mentioned that the watery hernia is there,
then make the patient sit on a raised chair; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation along the body; and the opening should be large, so that all the water flows out;
then put cotton on the place, and tie it, and let the rest of the water flow out, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white tissue does not let the water come out in the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a pen or the instrument with which one extracts the water from dropsy patients, the form of which is mentioned before; and enlarge the wound a little, and know that the water will return, and will gather again after six months or so, and thus the patient will pass his days.
