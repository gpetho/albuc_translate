Chapter thirty-three on the treatment of dislocated heel.
The heel bone may be slightly displaced.
It may also be completely dislocated.
Its dislocation can be either inwards or outwards.
The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding towards the side to which it has been dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to reduce.
This is done by gently extending it with the hands and straightening it until it returns (to its place).
As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated
the patient should be seated
and a strong assistant should hold him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you take hold of his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below his foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand then with your left hand twice.
Then extend it with the left hand and push the dorsum of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without force, you do this twice as we have described.
Then push the dorsum of the foot to the leg on the third time while you pull at the ankle.
If it returns (to its place) in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot leveled
otherwise repeat the procedure, it will return.
If its return is prevented using what we have described
then lay the patient on his back on the ground and plant a stake firmly in the ground so that it falls between his thighs, having wrapped cloths around it so that it does not harm the patient.
Then an assistant secures his thigh.
Then another assistant extends the leg either with his hands or with a strap that he ties to the ankle of the leg.
Then each assistant extends opposite the extension of his companion, and the stake is standing between the patient's thighs, holding him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands and another assistant holds the healthy leg down.
For the dislocation will return quickly.
So when the dislocation returns and you are certain of its return, apply the bandage and the splint and tighten it with firm bandages and tie the foot with the bandage downwards.
It is necessary to avoid the tendon that is above the heel from behind so that the bandage is not tight on it and harms it.
Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it.
Then release it on the third or fourth day.
And the patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not recur and be ruined and will not accept treatment after that.
If he experiences a hot swelling, it is necessary to use in its soothing what we have previously described in another place of treatment and softening until it disappears.
