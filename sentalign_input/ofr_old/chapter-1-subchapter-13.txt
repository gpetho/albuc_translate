of the flow of tears
When the tears from the eyes are old and habitual and are on the veins, or next to the arteries that are on the outward appearance of the head; and it is seen that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries in the hinder part below the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize lightly above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
