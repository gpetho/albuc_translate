of the coldness of the head It is necessary that the head be cleansed with purgatives and what we have mentioned before; afterward shave the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each corner, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is enduring, and the disease is strong, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the core is burned, then lift your hand; afterward treat until healed, and use the cautery called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.	Purgation of the head should come first, with electuaries and the other things we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head; and then burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head and one on either frontal prominence and one on the occiput, and three on the vertebrae of the neck. And if the malady of flaccidity of the body require still more and the patient be fit to bear it, and his disease be severe and have a strong hold on him, burn him with four more cauterizations on his dorsal vertebrae and carry the cautery to burn almost through the thickness of the skin; then remove your hand and treat him in the aforesaid manner till he is healed. Let the cautery be olivary.	0.9052456
