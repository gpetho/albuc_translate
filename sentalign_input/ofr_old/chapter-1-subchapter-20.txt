of the movement of the teeth
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth become loose, and you treat it with medicines and it does not help, then place the patient's head on your lap; afterward heat the cautery whose shape will be mentioned later in such a way that you place a ring on the tooth; and place the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold it until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth; afterward lift your hand and repeat the cautery as you wish; afterward, have the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this way, the loose tooth will be firm, the softened gums will be strengthened, and the corrupted moisture will be dried.
