Chapter eighty-one on the perforation of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE. On cutting and incising piles that are bleeding, and the treatment of fissures.	0.813889
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters, or like grapes, and they are small and large, and blood flows from them constantly, and they are single and multiple, and they are outside the anus and on its edges, except that those that are outside the anus are mostly dry, with yellow water or a little blood flowing constantly from them, and they are the color of the skin.	Haemorrhoids are of two kinds: either internal, resembling red bubbles or grape-seeds, small or large, with blood perpetually flowing, and they may be single or multiple; or they may be external, round about the anus. External ones are for the most part fairly dry; a little yellowish fluid or blood constantly oozes from them, and they are of the colour of the body.	0.90921265
And the treatment of what is inside the anus is that you order the patient to defecate and strain until the anus comes out and the warts appear to you, then you quickly hook them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, then cut them at their roots.	The treatment of internal piles: bid the patient open his bowel and bear down until the anus opens out and the swellings are disclosed to you; then quickly take hold of them with hooks or with your finger-nail and cut them off near the roots.	0.75405324
If the hooks do not hold in them because of their moisture and looseness, then scrape them with a rough cloth or a piece of rough bread or pull them with your fingers, then cut them, then sprinkle on them after cutting some sharp powders so that it takes the place of cauterization or cauterize them as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.	If the hook does not retain its hold on them because of their humidity and softness, then cut them with a piece of rough material or a rag of goat-hair, or draw them out with your fingers and cut them off; and after excision sprinkle some caustic powder on to act instead of the cautery; or cauterize them as previously described in the book on cauterization; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.89214504
If the anus does not respond to coming out, then inject the patient with an enema that has a little sting to wash what is in the anus and it will come out quickly when the patient strains.	But if the anus will not open out for you then give a slightly corrosive enema so as to wash out what is within, and then, the anus will open out quickly when the patient bears down.	0.820264
As for the warts outside the anus, their matter is easy and simple, which is that you take them with your fingernail or hook them with a hook and cut them, then treat them with what we mentioned until they heal.	Now the treatment of external piles is easy and simple: take hold of them with your finger-nails or catch them up with a hook and cut them away; and treat as before mentioned until cured.	0.7326223
And whoever dislikes cutting with iron, it is appropriate to use piercing them in this way: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle, then pull the wart up and pierce it with the needle at its root from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is crossed, and tighten the wart tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle.	But with the patient who refuses excision with the knife, this manner of removal should be practised: thread a twisted thread into a needle, then draw the piles upward and run the needle through the root of each, from one side to the other, and wind the ends of the thread round beneath the needle as it lies crosswise, and bind the pile firmly; then knot the thread and remove the needle.	0.8318585
Do this with all the warts and leave one of them unpierced so that the excess blood flows from it.	Do this with each pile, but leave one not destroyed so that the superfluous blood may flow from it.	0.8417375
Then put on the anus a cloth dipped in rose oil or cerotti and put it on the anus and order the patient to rest, then leave it until they fall, and if the warts fall, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.	Then apply to the anus a piece of material soaked in oil of roses or wax; apply it and bid the patient lie quiet; then leave him until the piles fall away. When they fall away, dress with ointments and the usual dressings until healed.	0.7956164
As for the treatment of fissures, it often occurs from dryness of the stool and constipation, so if it becomes chronic and no medicine works on it, it is appropriate to scrape it with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents it from healing is removed, then treat it until it heals as it should.	The treatment of fissures: these often arise from dryness of the faeces and from constipation. If they become chronic, and medical treatment is unavailing, you should scrape them with the edge of a scalpel or with your finger-nail until they become soft and the upper layer, that prevents healing, is removed; then dress until they mend as they should.	0.8109714
If it does not heal, then repeat scraping it more severely than the first time until it bleeds well and peels, then treat it, and it will heal.	But if they do not heal, repeat the scraping more strongly than at first until they bleed freely and become raw; then apply dressings and they will heal.	0.74223876
