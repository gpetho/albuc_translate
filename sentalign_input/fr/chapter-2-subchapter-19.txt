About the fistula of the eye
The doctors call it "arissati" fistula: when you treat it with cautery and sharp burning medicine as I have described before, and it is not healed, then the procedure is that you cut above the abscess, where it should heal, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which this is the form; and it is called "rough head," and is made of Indian iron with one round head, and is pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the area of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is scraped; and do this several times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and it remains so for forty days, and it does not renew and is not abscessed, and bad occurrences do not come, know that it is healed; if not, there is no other method but to return the fistula to the hole of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of the iron have three angles, and let the shaft be thin to the end as you see here:
Then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the air comes out if he holds his hand on his nose; and then restore the area with dry medicines, as I have instructed you, and when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the material will go to the nose; this is an easier thing for the patient.
