of the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen as we have mentioned in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three ways of cautery that are all good.
One method is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cautery we mentioned earlier; do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient lie on his back;
Another method of cautery is to heat the cautery with two nerves, as we showed in the dislocation of the shoulder; lift the core that is at the spleen, where the patient's ribs come on the left side, and the elevation where you lift the core should be along the length of the body, and the cauteries should be along the width of the body.
Then insert the two burning nerves until the core is pierced on the other side, and then remove the cautery, and there will be four. And if you wish, cauterize with the cautery with three nerves. Afterward, treat when it has expelled pus for a long time, and this is much better than the other treatments mentioned earlier.
