When this consolidation occurs in many men so that the upper eyelid is joined with the white of the eye, and its movement and natural functions are hindered, then you must insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook.	This adhesion happens to many people, the upper lid sticking to the white of the eye and hindering its movement and preventing its natural functions. You should introduce the end of a probe beneath the lid and raise it upward; or stretch it with a hook.	0.8268446
Then you cut the adhesion with a fine instrument, which should not have a sharp point, but be somewhat blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the instrument without damaging the eye with its sharpness.	Then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel; it should not be so sharp as a cutting scalpel, but somewhat blunt, lest during the operation the patient should shake, and the scalpel slip, and the edge injure the eye.	0.80835265
And let your incision scrape away the adhesion easily until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and all the adhesion is healed.	Let your incision be as if peeling off the adhesion. Wait until the lid regains its natural shape and the adhesions be wholly healed.	0.7306197
Then put salty water in the eye and wash it; or drip into it fennel juice dissolved in water.	Then rinse the eye with saline and cleanse it; or instil into it drops of a watery solution of eye-lotion of verdigris.	0.7922735
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white, and on the third day use consolidating treatments until it is healed.	Then separate between the eye and the lid with a linen pad and put over the eye a piece of wool moistened with white of egg; and after the third day employ healing eye-lotions till it is better.	0.9094664
