On extracting thorns and other things stuck in the throat.	On the extraction of a fish-bone or anything else that sticks in the throat.	0.67615044
Often a bone or fishbone or something else gets stuck in the throat, so you should remove what is visible and can be seen after pressing down the tongue with the instrument in sunlight.	There often sticks in the throat a bone or fish-bone or something else. After you have depressed the tongue with the instrument in the full light of the sun, so that what is stuck in the throat is made as conspicuous as possible, you should then remove whatever can be seen and comes into view.	0.89104295
What you cannot see and is hidden in the throat, you should have the patient vomit before their food is digested in their stomach. Perhaps the stuck object will come out with the vomit, or the patient can swallow a piece of turnip or the root of chicory.	But when it is not visible to you, and lies hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food in his stomach is digested, for often the object comes out with vomiting.	0.7030028
Or they can swallow a bite of dry bread, or you take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and then they swallow it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the string quickly. Do this several times.	Or let him swallow a piece of turnip or a heart of lettuce or a morsel of dry bread; or take a marine sponge, dry, and tie it on a thread; then let him swallow the sponge and when it reaches where the sharp body is then quickly pull on the thread.	0.7859206
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:	Do this a number of times; for often the sharp body or bone will stick to the sponge and will come out. If it does not come out by the methods described, in this case employ an instrument made of lead, thus.	0.7871242
It should be slightly thicker than a probe and have a hook at its end.  The patient inserts it gently into their throat with their head raised upward, taking care not to touch their larynx so as not to cause coughing and dislodge the bone or thorn further. Or the physician inserts it with their hand.	It should be a little thicker than a probe, with a crook at its extremity. The patient himself should introduce it into his own throat gently; he should raise the head backwards and take care not to touch the larynx lest coughing be aroused. And let him remove therewith the bone or sharp body.	0.8881638
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the embedded object. They push downward or pull upward with the instrument, as they are best able, until it comes out.	Or else let the doctor introduce it with his hand (although it is better if the patient himself introduce it, since he knows the site of the obstruction) and push it down and then draw up his hand with the instrument; all this according to the way it presents itself to him, till it is removed.	0.6821995
