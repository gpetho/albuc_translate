 CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE.
On cutting the clitoris and fleshy growths in the female genitalia.
 The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.
You must grasp the growth with your hand or a hook and cut it off.
Do not cut too deeply, especially at the root of the growth, lest haemorrhage occur.
Then apply the usual dressing for wounds until it is healed.
As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.
