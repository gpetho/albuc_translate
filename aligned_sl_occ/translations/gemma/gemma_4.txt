O sons, I have finished this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, in order to perfect your faith in it, and for the praises of its works, and for the declarations of its secrets, it seems to me that I must complete this work for you, which is a part of my art, so to speak, surgery.
For our region and our time, surgery is a perilous art, so that the science of it is almost lost; and its signs are few; and it remains only for a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which change all things and even makes void the greatest knowledge and strength of it
I declare that I have composed this treatise in such a way as to follow the way of exposition and declaration, and to abbreviate; and that I have added to it the forms of the cautery instruments and other instruments of the work as well as for the addition of the declaration, and for the preparation of the patient, which is necessary
The greatest cause why you will not find a good surgeon in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that it covers many actors who have not exercised in the science of anatomy, who do not know the joints and the shapes of these, and the connection and separation of these; and the knowledge of bones, nerves and lacerations, and the number of these, and their colour; and of the pulse veins and their sounds, and the places of their sensation.
And as Hippocrates said, I have no name in small works, but I have it in the art of the hand.
Indeed, as I said at the beginning of this book, he already mentioned that anyone who is not learned in anatomy will fall into an error which will cause the death of men, as I have seen many of these fall into this error, for they are formed in this science but they throw away this science and these experiments
I have seen a foolish doctor and expert who has incised an abscess of scrofula in the groin of a woman, and has cut some arteries of the groin so that there flows great blood within her, and the woman died between her thighs.
And I have seen another doctor who believed that he could extract a stone from a man who had suffered from it for a long time, and the stone was great, and he went to him and cut out that stone with a piece of glass, and the man died on the third day
I have already mentioned this, and I see that because of the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient I know that he will die from this.
And I have seen another doctor who took the stipend of a duke from our land for surgery, and he owed it to a black slave who had been injured in the thigh; and in his ignorance the doctor, without taking any precautions, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with pins and needles, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And thus he left him according to his desires, and he relieved him, and he left him for a few days and commanded that he be unbound; and thus the thigh and the foot festered postoperatively and he came to his death
I went to him and found that he had unbound him, and he was peaceful and calm and relieved of his pains
But indeed corruption was already confirmed in the limb, for that I could not restrain it, and I could not stop the corruption of the limb until the patient was in danger of his life
And I have seen another doctor who pierced an abscess of cancer, and he made an ulcer nearby for several days, until the malignancy of the disease increased and overwhelmed him
The cause of this is that cancer is pure melancholy humor, and it does not suffice for it to overcome the whole of its effects, but that it should be applied only to the limb which suffers, so that it should be host to all the rest
Therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the art of surgery be divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which is dangerous in the greatest precautions.
And I have already mentioned this throughout this book in which I have discussed the art of surgery in which there is error and fear; for it is necessary for you to preserve this and to leave that which may cause fools to speak and deceive you
Therefore take up the sacred arms in the request and in the protection of God, and the sick minds in their facility and firmness
And thus, through the mercy of God, you have overcome adversity and achieved salvation, and praised the blessed succession; you have banished the terrible diseases that were difficult to cure, and finally overcome the weapons of that which you were afraid; so that your faith and your name remain in his sight, for your might rests in his glory.
Indeed, I have already mentioned several times: “There is no cure for a bad disease, so that no doctor will be called a liar”.
And I have already finished this book according to three chapters.
Let us begin the division of the book, and first of all from the first part. The first chapter is arranged from the head downwards, concerning the forms of instruments and cautery utensils, and what is necessary for the operation
The division of the second part. The second chapter deals with swelling and perforation, windbag, ulcers, and extraction of arrows, all categorized and arranged in terms of the forms of instruments
The third chapter deals with restoration and dislocation, treatment of fractures and similar cases; the chapter is arranged from the head downwards, concerning the forms of instruments
Since I have spoken of the qualities of the instruments of that cautery and the documents of them, and in what completion it is prohibited to make incisions
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the instruments of that cautery and the document of them is a long and profound one, subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and many great scholars have spoken of it, and they have disagreed with each other, and I believe that a small part of their sermons suffices for me, fearing a lengthening of the discourse
Therefore I say that incisions comply with all universal completion except for two completions, which are caudal completions of its matter.
In the caudal and dry completion of the matter disagreement arises; for some say that cautery is useful for that, while others say that it is harmful. For indeed, the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a disease which is cold and dry should be treated with something that is also cold and dry
And they say that the opposite is true, that cautery is useful in all cold and dry diseases that are seen in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of his body to the completion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this discourse that I have already experienced several times in my practice
I do not say that I have explained all that has been said about that already exists and is practiced in the chapter on cautery after practice, and knowing the diversity of the humors of men and the disposition of diseases in them, and their causes, their accidents, and the passage of time in them
In other completions, it is not a matter of fear for you, and especially in cold and humid diseases, for all doctors have already agreed on that, and they do not disagree concerning the use of cautery in those diseases
And you know, children, that the secret of treating cautery with fire and the gentleness of it is that fire is simple, and its action reaches only the part that is cauterized and does not affect the other part that is adjacent to it except for a small document.
And the action of treating with fire for inflammation reaches only that part of the limb from which it is cauterized, and it makes the painful part of the disease of difficult healing come out more easily
Therefore fire, for its sublimity and its gentle nature, does not do anything other than what we already know through experience and through the length of our studies concerning the art of truth about the causes; and for this reason I am excused from the length of this discourse because it is not legible to me in this place in this book the secret which is hidden with fire, and the quality of the operation of it in the bodies and the expulsion of the disease which it expels, as it is demonstrated in philosophical discourse.
And you know, children, that they disagree about the time when it is convenient to make incisions and when it is best to wait.
And I say that the cautery is convenient at all times, so that for the accidental time it is immersed in the nourishment of that which I call the cautery, which is shot, and more so if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, strong and fiery, which do not suffer delay so that it is feared of those which come with malice, which is greater than a small nourishment entering for the time.
And I say that it is not necessary to burn other parts of the body, or, fools, those vulgar people and foolish doctors, so that to that disease which is cured by the cautery, it is not ridiculous all the time, and they stop that consequence.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not thus that they say, because the cautery is nothing but a remedy in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of these pains.</end_of_turn>
More however the cautery surpasses medicine by its delight and worth and greatness of its operation.</end_of_turn>
And it is possible that your disease will return at some time, according to the complexion of the disease and the location of the disease, and the worth of them, and what is prepared in the body of them by the gathering of the superfluities in them, and what is obtained by them in their acquisition in food and the like of those causes; but the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in a few superfluities and humors, just as if it were cautery of a tooth for pain and the like of that, possible is that in them the said pain does not return, even though it is made small.</end_of_turn
And it may be said vulgarly that the cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and is a miraculous thing, not as those understand it, because they grow that it is not a cure that makes use of either medicine or any other cause except the cautery itself.</end_of_turn
And the cause is contrary to that; and the understanding that the cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when they administer the methods of healing in certain diseases, and those medicines do not confer, and therefore in the end of the cause they administer man cautery, and make use of that.</end_of_turn And indeed it is said that the cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and fools doctors have of it.</end_of_turn
And I say that the ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron, and I do not say anything but for the equality of the gold and the fineness of its substance.</end_of_turn
And I say that the place of the cautery does not make it weak, as it is not absolutely true, for I have already seen that it does no harm to any other part, and that the cautery with gold is better than that with iron, as they say; however, when you make cautery with gold and fire, it is not your will that is the cause, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the roughness of the gold, and that prepares to receive heat; and if you mix them over the fire the gold will be consumed by the fire, and if you do not mix them well some plates will be left unburned because the artist will take up the space of that.
And for this reason the cautery with iron must be made more lightly and more cautiously of the operation.</end_of_turn
And I have already ordered this chapter on the cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head downwards, so that I may relieve the seeker of what he demands of me.</end_of_turn>
The first chapter.</end_of_turn
This cauterization confers on coldness and humidity about the accidental cause of which it gives rise, so it is the cause of soda and multiple fluxes rheumatic, applied to the head to the flanks of the heels and the swelling fluent, and multiple sleeplessness, and toothache and swelling of the tonsils, and universally of all diseases that come from coldness, even as paralysis, hydrophobia and apoplexy, and it is similar in these diseases.</end_of_turn
The way of this cauterization is as follows: first command the patient to evacuate with laxatives for three or four nights, according to the excess of the virtue of the disease and the age of the patient and his custom.</end_of_turn
And then command him to raise his head on a razor, and do that between his thighs on a fallen bench and that he rest his hands on his feet.</end_of_turn
And then stop the shaving of your palm near the bulge under the nose between the knees.</end_of_turn May it be so, since the physician has said of the said limb that it has arrived, signify that limb at the source of the pain, and immediately apply the cautery with olive oil of the kind mentioned.
And immediately suspend that over the limb which is causing the pain, in such a way that it descends gradually, with your hand tightly clasped around it, and you rotate that
And immediately lift your hand slightly and support the limb, and if you see any quantity of bone exposed whatever its quantity, as much as a grain of wheat, elevate your hand, and if you do not turn your hand back at that point, at another, if it is cold, until the bone is seen again as I have said to you
And immediately take a little salt and dissolve it on the limb and keep it there for three days.
And immediately suspend over the wound the edge bound by a border and keep it there until the burn mark of the fire is destroyed. And immediately treat the limb with tetracycline until it is healed.
And I say that when the wound remains open, take honey from the brace, because it is better and more helpful
I say that the bone must be cauterized until it reaches the bone, and that the cautery must be kept on until all parts of the substance of the bone are solidified.
And immediately let there be rest that is appropriate for the bone, and immediately cure it.
And I say that the cautery must reach the posterior part of the limb, so that in front of the bone it should strengthen the price in front of the bone rather than weakening it. This is the form of small alphbetization: And they consider that from that limb the vapor of the head escapes
And if the wound remains open for a long time, and immediately cure it when it is solidified
I do not see these two kinds of cautery in all my life, except for a few fools according to their way of thinking; and leave that, for me, is better for health, when it is; because the head is developed by the solution of continuity of its like in other members, and especially when the head of the patient is of fiery nature.
The first kind of cautery is better and more helpful for me; and from that one here and from that work I find health.

Of cautery of the head.
When in the whole head chronic pain occurs for a long time and the disease is prolonged, and it uses herbs, poultices, cataplasms, plasters, butter, millet, garlic, vinegar, and radish, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery which they count on and which does not benefit it from those causes, then consider that if the head of the disease has great fiery nature; and it is not fiery nor does it find great cold, then cauterize with another cautery leaving a little space between them. And immediately cauterize that over the joint of the heel with the cautery until the bone is fractured Cut the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted and cauterize that with a cautery in the posterior part of the head in the area where wind is stopped. And move your hand away from there, and do not uncover the bone, because the disease from this will find great pain other than the pain of all the other cauteries of the head
I say this cautery in its place, because the cautery of the corn of the head and the occiput is more subtle than that of the middle part of the head; and this is its form
End of document
Of ancient cauteries.
When there is pain all over the head, or widespread pain in the heel, evacuate with medicines the head slightly flexible, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the sections on diseases; and all this without benefit, for the cauterization in this case is in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with a burn
The cautery with burning medicine is that you take a spoonful of alum, and sprinkle that on and remove the extremities of it from both heads And immediately prick the area of the pain in the temple with a lancet so that the bone is left visible
And now stretch over them and stop the constriction, and leave it for three hours; then remove it and bring it close, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and then rest over it until the limb makes a brace.
And do the same until it is healed
If you wish, faith that many medicines which I have written in the previous treatise of medicinal remedies will combat these.</start_of_turn>
May the cautery be performed according to this manner: fire for the cautery of which this is the form:</start_of_turn
and it is called closed nails, because its head is like a nail with a curvature, and in the middle of the limb there is a small protrusion.</start_of_turn>
And rest upon the place of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the wound which is left does not adhere — and slowly withdraw the needle little by little.</start_of_turn
And if the quantity that is adhered by the property of the ointment is as much as the majority, elevate your hand so that the artery is not adhered which is left, so that there is no obstruction of the flow of blood.</start_of_turn
And soak the limb in salt water and rest it upon the limb, and leave it for three days; and then rest the limb liberally with a border, and do the treatment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If you wish, cauterize at the extremity of the cuticle according to the cautery, and keep the incision of the artery in this place properly not antique.</start_of_turn
Chapter four.</start_of_turn>
Of the cautery of antique embolism.</start_of_turn
When you have cured the embolism as we have said of the preceding treatment, and as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and you do not take advantage of the treatment, and sometimes for the disease that does not reach that which we have said of the first cautery with medicine or of the cautery with fire, when you light the cautery of the cuticle until it is whitened, since it signifies over the limb where the pain is in the line of length of which is the majority of the finger, or whatever; keep your hand still for a moment and stretch it until you have incised the artery and reached the bone.</start_of_turn
But it is necessary that you take care of the continuity of the mandible, which is bad for chewing, and that the nerve is not adhered and that the muscle which has that is not affected, and that no spasm occurs.</start_of_turn
And if it is about the custody and caution of the flow of blood of the absected artery, which is feared, and more so to that which ignores what is done and is negligent; leave the operation in them at the beginning.</start_of_turn
And I come to remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood in accidental embolism according to the custom of this book.</start_of_turn
And if you see this disease that does not support this cautery and you see the limb of the disease tolerable, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter of stretching of the artery with two nails, and this cautery is better and more convenient.</start_of_turn
Chapter five.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the pains of the heel.</start_of_turn
When in the heel there is pain due to cold and it is cured by means of lacative causes and by the other treatment which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, when the fire is lit, this is the one which has no point, of which this is the form:</start_of_turn
And bring the point close to the ignition, and let it be surrounded by the entire heel as if it were rolling, or in the circumference of any limb if the pain is in any limb.</start_of_turn Along with you the cautery of the root of the heel a little at a time because you have seen that it bears.
And if you cauterize ten points throughout the heel, and which are those, and do the treatment of the wounds until they are healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter six.</start_of_turn
From cautery of the torus.
The torus which is cured and by cautery is nothing other than the specious things which cause swelling, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.</end_of_turn>
Avoid cautery of the specious thing which must be dry or which causes spasm of the nerve.</end_of_turn>
When you have cured that specious torus of boils and carbuncles and abscesses, and you have completed the treatment, do not touch the cure, for at that time you must cauterize the patient three times: the first to remove the root of the abscess, the second a little beyond the temporal bone, and the third to join the two lips together.</end_of_turn
And leave the cautery point untouched for the opposite of the affected part, for it does not matter except for the part that appears to be well.</end_of_turn
And the way of cautery is that you cauterize that which is at the root of the limb above a small amount over the head of the toe, and in the temple another, the length of which is according to the length of the finger which you are pointing to, and withdraw your hand from the cautery until the quantity of the matter of the species of the heel has been consumed.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is of the surgeon, the form of which is like a table.</end_of_turn More importantly, it is better to leave a little less rather than too much; and cover with it of excessive thickness a little.</end_of_turn
And then treat the area like that which is denant proceeds until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter VII.</end_of_turn>
Of cautery of ancient apoplexy.</end_of_turn
When the apoplexy is ancient and you have cured that which we have said and it does not have fever, then cauterize that which is four times: over all the toes of the foot; at the heel and the middle of the foot, as we have said; and in the heel.</end_of_turn And the manner of the cautery is sufficient as has been said.</end_of_turn
And it is already cauterized at the mouth of the stomach; and it is better later; and do treat like that which proceeds.</end_of_turn
Chapter VIII.</end_of_turn
Of cautery for painful forgetfulness.</end_of_turn
Cover that the patient has given to the disease at the beginning with large doses of castor oil and pills that serve to soften it.</end_of_turn
And then uncover the head of the patient throughout the whole illness and keep him from spitting, applying the plaster as is described in the treatise on plastering.</end_of_turn
And withdraw any herbs, for that is the manner of the cautery.</end_of_turn And do thus according to that method which I have already said.</end_of_turn
And thus if for those who are well it is good; and if not, then do three cauteries at the back of the foot, which are dependent from the most superior part of the head to the most posterior part of the heel.</end_of_turn And withdraw between each cautery the thickness of the finger, and do treat the cautery like that which proceeds.</end_of_turn
More if you are addicted to it and the patient is tolerant, then do cauterize at the middle of the foot; and if you wish greater addiction, then cauterize that over both toes.</end_of_turn
Like that when it is healed; and the cautery olive oil like that which is described in the preceding manner.</end_of_turn
Chapter IX.</end_of_turn
Of cautery of nails and of softening of all the body.</end_of_turn
Cover that you are processing in the softening of the head with large doses of castor oil and as we have said; and uncover the head of the patient, and cauterize that which is cauterized in the middle of the head, and over all the toes of the head, and over the posterior part of it, and three cauteries over the vertebrae of the heel.</end_of_turn
And if it is necessary in the disease of softening of the body of the limbs that the patient be tolerant and the disease is strong, then do cauterize that which is four times over the vertebrae of the buttocks, and immediately cauterize until it is consumed by the matter of the heel, and remove the hand.</end_of_turn And thus care for the one who is well, and this is the cautery of olive oil.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Of cautery of olive oil.
It is not cauterized which is epileptic, but that which is for flexure
And therefore modify the head of the patient at the beginning and at the end of the treatment and the other care that we have dictated in the division when the disease is great and tolerates the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not suffer from medicines, then give Guarantees and masticators to him, giving him this for a few days, for the benefit of the foods.
And thus remove the head of the disease, and then cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head according to the preceding manner, and on another side cauterize in the occiput of the head, and over every joint of the head if necessary And if the disease is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize that which we have said, having paralyzed and softened the body over the vertebrae of the loin and the vertebrae of the thigh
And let olive oil be cauterized as aforesaid
May be if the disease is a child, then pause the cautery slightly according to this manner

Of cautery of melancholy
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and great inflammation, then cauterize that which we have said is to paralyze
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive liquid that is declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is humid, then give him to drink that which softens the head of him according to what has been said in the division
And thus remove the head of the disease, and then make a gentle turning of the head downwards, and remove that which is in the middle of the head
And the patient is to sit down fallen, and is to be held entirely apart
And thus stop the liniment; and it is more worthy to border against the edge of sheep And smear that over the fire for temperate heat for measure, which says suffer when it is more in it And thus put that in the middle of the head of him in the circle, and keep it until it is inflamed
And give him to drink every week a quarter of a pint, with the other rule of him be well until he is healed; or if you will, cauterize that which makes little points according to the most of him, but keep your hand over him in this order: this is the kind of cautery which humps the head equal.
And thus stop that swelling inwards in border or in gray of gutta

Of cautery of water descending in the sweat
When it is declared to you at the commencement of water in the sweat for the symptoms which I have said in the division, then commence and give him to drink the patient that which softens the head of him, and keep away from him all humors.
And make him sweat in bath in lukewarm water for a few days
And thus command him that he raise his head, and cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head; and cauterize that which is like two cauteries over two temples if it is the commencement of sweating of water in two sweats, or of one half if it is the commencement of sweating of water in one sweat
Incisions are to be made over all the veins and arteries which are left to the root of the codena; and let the cauteries be made in that length in the breadth of the temples
And keep your hands away from the blood when it is cauterized; and if you see that there is blood, stop any medicine that is to you possible
And I saw that the knowledge which is in the extraction of arteries and the abstinence from those and caution of fluxes of blood.
And each vein is cauterized at the root of two bones with two cauteries that are produced immediately.
Chapter XIII
Of the cautery of ancient tears
When tears of the eyes are ancient, that is to say when they have been accumulating for a long time through veins and arteries that are in the visible part of the head and it is confirmed that these are useless fatty drools, then cauterize that which we recounted in the chapter on the commencement of water concerning the veins in the eyes, and at the middle of the head and at the two temples, and two cauteries at the root of two bones And if you disagree with the addition, then cauterize that in all the breadth of the heel on the edge of the nail with a small cautery
Chapter XIV
Of the cautery of the smell of the nose
When your physician has said what we have said in the division and does not benefit from your medicine, then you appear and give to the patient to drink for three nights; and approach his head and cauterize that which is between the two humps and the olive And approach cauterizes that which is between the two nails with two cauteries over the two nails of the hair a little.
And take care that you do not burn the vessels that you do not burn those
And concerning the cautery of the nail this is the form
Chapter XV
Of the cautery of the softening of the eyelids of the eyes
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery of this kind; and this is the way to do it:
And if you do, cauterize that over the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries throughout, and let them stretch from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the quantity of the eyebrow
And do not press too much your hand with the cautery, but as much as the third part of the eyelid is adhered
Chapter XVI
Of the cautery of the eyelid of the eye when it turns to black spots and turns the eye purple
When the spots of the eye are converted to black spots even if you prick the eye, cauterize in those two ways, that is either with the cautery or with medicine that burns.
If you do the cautery with fire, command the patient to drink something that softens the eyes as those which cause them to swell up, until they are prolonged and equal; and if you prick that, you must strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that they are not painful until the spots disappear
Therefore when they are prolonged and equal, the physician should remove the patient's head from the bed and approach the eyes of the patient with the tweezers, with a signal that is like the figure of a dead fern, and let the beginning of the signal be near the spots
And approach pause in sponge soaked in vinegar or in mucus of herbs on the eye.
And approach cauterize in this way.
And approach cauterize over the signal which you have given, little by little, in soft veins, until the surface of the wound which is like a dead fern is completely consumed, that is to say like a fern leaf, all in appearance properly
The sign of the healing of the wound is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and the spots of the eye already raised beyond the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand and leave it there for three days, and approach pause over it with a border until the scar is healed And approach take care of that until it is healed
But if it returns for any reason approach strengthen the eye again and the eyelid is softened, then do another cautery over that all just as you did at the beginning.
May it be so that if they are pressed in the palm of their hand, then cauterize that which is elevated to the natural locus and is equal, and that they may not put out the smell.
May the cautery be as with medicine, for it commands the patient to rest the pain within that it is prolonged and equal, and then make a burn of paper like the shape of a myrtle leaf.</end_of_turn>
And take from saffron with wine a little bit. namely.</end_of_turn> Or what, mix those things together, and make a fomentation so that it is not heated; and spread that on the paper which is made like a myrtle leaf, and put a cover over the smell or both; put the patient's head in the gut in a basin of water, and the chief of the patient is in the belly.</end_of_turn>
And say about the medicine and put a little on it so that the patient does not feel the bitterness of the medicine, for the bitterness is in them like fire.</end_of_turn
And when you perceive that the other bitterness has passed, then read the medicine and do not put it on the belly as you were told; when the bitterness has passed, then remain the medicine and wash the smell with water; and when you consider that the palm is already lifted like that which is washed after the constriction with fire or incision, for the palm is thus good; and if it does not return from the medicine on the place where you did not put the medicine and did not burn it until the operation is complete and the smell is contracted.</end_of_turn>
And so rest over the wound until the swelling of the wound has passed away, and care for that which is painful in the morning or at another time until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary for you to know that you must keep an eye on the wound so that no more medicine falls out of the wound, and if the palm is somewhat bruised for several days, that any cause of the pain in the palm is softened, the doctor shall repeat the medicine on that place where the palm is softened, just as you did at the beginning, and in this way you will do away with the cause of the pain.</end_of_turn
This is the shape of a myrtle leaf.</end_of_turn>
And you know that the humors of men are diversified according to their magnitude and their smallness, and therefore according to what is useful for your contraction.</end_of_turn
And do not be ashamed of the way things are done in this art.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVII.</end_of_turn>
Of cauterization of the fistula which is in the tear duct of the eye.</end_of_turn
When you cure the fistula with that which we have said in the divisions of the diseases and you do not confer your care, then you must know that you must cauterize that in the following manner: command the patient to rest their head on the belly, and keep their head supported by any attendant between the thighs in such a way that it is neither too tight nor too loose on the head.</end_of_turn
And do so put the heel in a basin of water or in mucus on the palm of the hand.</end_of_turn
And so burn with the cautery which is like this:
which is convex, like the shape of a tube or like a scorpion's tail, from one extremity to the other where the cautery is applied.</end_of_turn
And if you want, penetrate through to the other extremity.</end_of_turn And if you wish, come out like that which is trying.</end_of_turn
However, that which is convex is better for the work.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is open, then press on it to bring it to health and dry that.</end_of_turn And if it is not open, then open it up and extract the pus from it.</end_of_turn
And so rest over the wound for a little while after you have cauterized, so that your hand does not become numb or the patient is not disturbed, and then remove the cautery from the palm of the hand and cover the wound.</end_of_turn
And so if at the beginning of the treatment the cautery went through the bone, that is well; but if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice more, if necessary; and leave that for three days, and then rest over that wound near the border and send for it to be dried until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If he has remained ill for several days and is not cured, then immediately suspend aggressive treatment until the bone is exposed and treated as you deem appropriate in the chapter.
Another method of cautery for fistula is as follows: enter the fistula and cut through it, then immediately stop at the root of the fistula. The amount of blood that escapes is insignificant; hold your hand firmly over the wound to prevent further bleeding, and do not cause the patient additional pain by causing more bleeding. Cover the wound with a cloth soaked in urine or water, as the blood will adhere to the fistula and promote healing.
If the fistula is healed with the cautery and care described previously, that is sufficient; but if not, it is necessary to administer treatment through the nose and reduce the fistula to its proper location

Concerning the cautery of the wound.</start_of_turn>
Motes of blood often accompany wounds, especially in children.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when you treat those wounds as we have said in the divisions and do not neglect your care, it is necessary to make a small incision according to this method:
And the curvature of the incision according to the thickness of the skin.</start_of_turn
Immediately stop the bleeding around the wound as soon as the cautery reaches the bottom of the wound.</start_of_turn
And take care of the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Concerning the cautery of a fistula in the mouth.</start_of_turn
When in the wisdom of the uvula or on the palate or on the wisdom teeth there is an abscess and the swelling is great, and it is ruptured, and it is softened, and the fistula is formed, and you do not neglect the treatment, then you must ignite the cautery according to the amount of pus received in the fistula, and put that flame into the cavity of the fistula, and hold your hand over it until the flame reaches the bottom, and after that remove it with some blood clots; and take care of the wound as we have said concerning the treatment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if the abscess is simple and the wound is healed, that is sufficient; but if not, it is necessary to uncover the location and remove the corrupted bone as we will explain in the chapter.</start_of_turn

Concerning the cautery of the teeth and the softening of the veins.</start_of_turn
When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth are blackened, and you treat them with medicines and do not fear them, then immediately suspend the treatment in the bowels of the patient, and immediately ignite the cautery in the shape that will be useful, while you keep your hand over the tooth until the flame reaches the root of the tooth.
And immediately remove your hand, and repeat the cautery a few times as you wish.</start_of_turn
And keep the patient's mouth filled with salt water and keep it there for an hour, and then remove it, because the blackened tooth is calmed and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupted humidity is dried up.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXI.</start_of_turn
Concerning the cautery of toothache.</start_of_turn
When the toothache is caused by cold, or if it is hot or does not respond to treatment with medicine, then the cautery can be performed in two ways: either by cautery around the tooth or by cautery with fire.</start_of_turn
Cautery around the tooth is to take the edge of the cow and put it into a crucible of iron, and take hold of the tooth with your hand and cover it with the edge of the cow, and immerse it in the cold, and immediately stop the bleeding around the tooth until it is cooled.</start_of_turn
And repeat the process a few times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn
Or if you wish, immerse cloth or cotton in the blood of the said limb and put it on the painful tooth, and keep that over the flame until the flame reaches the bottom of the tooth.</start_of_turn
The fire of the cautery must be strong enough to consume the quannula of fat or iron, even if there is any roughness in the body of the patient, for the intensity of the flame should not reach the patient's mouth.
The fire of the cautery must be strong enough to consume the shape of which it comes, and keep that over the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery is cool; and do whatever vegetables are necessary so that the pain may subside on this day or on another day.</end_of_turn>
And so it must be commanded that the patient open their mouth wide with good will and keep it open for an hour, and then close it; this is the way of the cautery.</end_of_turn>
And burn as much as you can of the extremities according to your ability.</end_of_turn>
This is the way of the cannula:</end_of_turn
Chapter XXII.</end_of_turn>
Of the cautery of extrusions.</end_of_turn>
When extrusions are caused by cold humors and do not obey digestion by medicines, you must cause digestion of those lightly by fire. The fire must consume the shape of this, having two limbs covered so that the smoke does not reach the other limb, and keep the flame over that limb for a while, and do the same with the other if necessary, until the pain has passed the root of the limb.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling is slight, keep the cautery away from the quantity of the swelling, and apply pressure to it for three days and keep your hand over it covered in fat until it has subsided the amount that the fire has consumed.</end_of_turn
And take care of that which is burnt and tense and wrinkled until it is healed.</end_of_turn

And burn that which is beyond the other burn beyond the joint of the colon at the back of the vertebra of the spine.</end_of_turn The burn of the spine must be like that described above.</end_of_turn

When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors and the patient has no fever or sweating and is old disease, then burn twice on the furcula in the recessed parts around the tonsils and below; and once in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and do the burn like that described above.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, make the burn with the cautery that is called punctate, the form of which you will find in the puncture of pain of the heel.</end_of_turn

Then ignite the cautery twice without covering its head; this is the way to do it.
Then ignite the cautery twice without covering its head; this is the way to do it. And when it penetrates to the other side, the cautery figure will be that of four cauteries.
Every burn is adjusted according to this count and because they are eight cauteries
Then place your hand over the cautery immediately with salt, and then adhere the patient to tranquility, and do not move the limb for any time until it is comfortable
And if the dislocation is at the base of the thumb and it is necessary to do so, then cauterize over the muscle under the thumb or over several points of the thumb, so that the joint is stabilized and the moisture is reduced and the patient is healed

Of the cautery of the stomach.</end_of_turn>
When there is cold and moisture in the stomach due to the excess of its digestion and if you continue your treatment methods and do not confirm, then it is necessary to place the patient on their side two steps up, extend their limbs and thighs, and then cauterize with three cauteries: on one cautery leave the toes for the quantity of one thumb under the thumb, and on two cauteries leave the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular figure of the cautery appears; and lengthen between those that are not adjusted that will make the pain less painful.
And if the depth of the burn is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the nail of the thumb
And the figure of the burn should be as follows: thus proceed with the addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach as follows; and this is a burn in the shape of a circle as follows:
And cauterize the stomach punctate where it is sensitive from this burn. And that you mark on the stomach point according to the quantity that you wish on the thumb, and then cauterize at those points; and care for that which precedes until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

When there is pain in the heel due to cold, moisture or excessive wind compared to the normal expulsion of the bowels, and it is cured by what we have said and without confirming, then it is necessary to place the patient supine on their neck, and mark with three cauteries as follows and with this quantity on the heel beyond the hip bones, between the heel bone and the malleolus.
And the space between each cautery should be according to the thickness of the thumb, and the cauteries should be according to the length of the bone to be treated
Do not press on the cauteries too much.</end_of_turn>
And if the quantity of the liquid that is poured out is equal to the amount of the nail of the thumb, do not adjust it further; and if the patient is standing on their feet, if it is not standing, then be still, which has already extended their thighs, and lift the knees high.</end_of_turn
And you may possibly cauterize these cauteries with a pointed cautery, when it is in your skill and prudence in the art.</end_of_turn
And beware that you do not process too much in the cautery, and that you cover the entirety of the stomach so that the whole body is cauterized and reaches the intestines, for the stomach is subtle here; and take care that you do not burn it.</end_of_turn

When there is an extrusion or abscess in the heel and you wish to know if that abscess is in the bone of the heel or in the membrane of it, then if it is in the bone of the heel, the pain is intense and the swelling is increased.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the membrane of the heel, with great pain which often exhausts the doctors in their care of it.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover the patient with a sheet; then touch his foot with the thumb; and with the cautery ignite the portion which is like a rag, as is described in the other page. And burn until the whole area is covered, until it reaches the cartilage, until the wound is healed.
And take care of the other wounds until they are healed
And do not use this method of cautery except for those whom we have studied in the art of medicine, and in whom many bad diseases have been overcome; for in this case, if you experiment too much with this operation, you will cause more harm than good.

Of the cautery of the sole of the foot.</start_of_turn>
I say that the ancient cautery of the roots of the aristology towards the sole of the foot is done in this manner; take from the roots of the aristology a long dry stick which is found, and which is of the thickness of the finger.</start_of_turn
And immerse that in oil and put it in the fire, and then cauterize for a little in that place which is between the continuation of the heel bone and the ankle; and with two small cautery needles leave two guides, one slightly declining towards the side which is beyond the beard, and two cautery needles in that which is declining between the fifth rib and the hip, declining slightly towards the back; and another cautery needle in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cautery needles from the back parts; and one cautery needle in that place which is between the two buttocks, and two cautery needles from the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery needle which is between two buttocks.</start_of_turn
And do not put your hand over the cautery, but rather in the manifestation of the heel in work.</start_of_turn
And I say that the ancient people used cautery of iron similar to a ray and fire, and put that in that place which is between the ribs, until we reach that cartilage and it is healed, as we have said concerning the heel of the foot.</start_of_turn
Moreover in this perforation there is no fear, because we often do this in the fistula where there is no healing.</start_of_turn

Of the cautery of the heel.</start_of_turn
When you have cured the disease of the heel according to what we have said in the division, and you do not confer your care, then the hour of cautery comes in three ways, which are all useful, namely that you make three or four lines according to the length of the heel according to the figure of the cautery needles of the foot, the figure of which has preceded.</start_of_turn
And between each cautery there should be the thickness of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cautery should be the manner which we have said concerning the cautery of the foot equally.
And do not put your hand over the cautery; and the patient should be even on the side of the two thighs.</start_of_turn
And another manner of cautery is that you ignite the cautery having two supports, which causes we have said in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and lift the heel which is in the end of the heel the bone to protect the heel of the disease.</start_of_turn
And let your elevation be such as to lift the heel according to the length of the limb, so that the cautery is made according to the breadth of the body.</start_of_turn
And bring together the two supports, ignite once, in that place where we have pierced the heel of the other side.</start_of_turn
And then take out the cautery; and thus there are four cautery needles.</start_of_turn
Or if you wish, cauterize with three supports.</start_of_turn
And keep your care of the cautery longer than it has lain without moving for a few days, because it is different from the other preceding causes in the treatment.</start_of_turn

And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be in proportion to the spiciness of the wound
And then apply oil to the cautery so that it does not burn for a long time
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment until after the cautery has closed so that they do not become infected, and give them food to eat with the help of the healer.
The form of the cautery which should be used to cauterize the abdomen is the claw, according to the shape of that which is precedent, and that which is precedent to its form is the olive

It is cauterized thus: and make two cauteries on each side of the thigh, and in each part make a cautery at the extremity of the cautery cut And the cautery must be of the length of the thigh: leave the nail on the upper part and the other put the middle of the foot in the place of the thigh; and make two cauteries on each thigh

On the cautery of the sciatic vein.
When there is pain in the ankle area, caused by cold and humidity, the disease is cured with what has been said and not confirmed, and when it is old, then you must keep the patient away from humors which come from solid pills or artificial pills or something similar; and then cauterize that.</end_of_turn>
And the manner of cautery in this case is according to two manners: either with medicinal substances that burn, or with fire.
The second manner is as follows: you make three triangular cauteries on the ankle area according to this form; and do it with good depth.</end_of_turn And the space between each cautery should be the quantity of the thickness of the toe, and if the cautery is of olive oil or great.</end_of_turn>
Many people say that the cautery should be made over the middle of the ankle for that there are four cauteries.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize around the circle which precedes the formation of the dislocation of the ankle, which is a continuous circle and burns the spiciness of the whole codena.</end_of_turn
This is the manner of cautery in sciatica when the pain is attached to the ankle and does not extend into the thigh.</end_of_turn
If it extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauteries on the surface of the thigh over the area where the pain is felt; and one on the hip for four fingers a little beyond the navel.</end_of_turn>
If the cautery is to be repeated, and the depth of the cautery is according to the quantity of spiciness of the codena.</end_of_turn
If the patient reports that the pain extends to the area below the toes, then cauterize here where you made the cautery for three points or four or more if you desire.</end_of_turn
If the patient reports that the pain is still there despite the previous treatment, then cauterize here with one repeated cautery.</end_of_turn
And keep this in mind in all cauterizations that you do not finish with the cautery while you burn nerves or great vessels, and that for this reason it is over the patient neither damage nor contraction.</end_of_turn
And I have seen others who have cauterized on the hip and finished with the cautery, and the limb was so swollen that the tumor reached the foot, and the limb was perforated and corrupted throughout.</end_of_turn And give a strong solution of vinegar, and do the same with death.</end_of_turn
And if the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this manner.</end_of_turn
And the wise people say concerning the cautery of the ankle that the cautery which is like a circle of iron whose circumference is the length of a palm; and be deep enough to reach the marrow according to the thickness of a date seed or less.</end_of_turn
And draw that circle a third time; and let the space between them be the quantity of the nail of the thumb; and let those circles be closed with two fingers; and let the length of those strokes be a nail or two nails, and make in those grooves of iron properly placed in the circles; and this is the form of them.</end_of_turn
And let the fire be lit in the firebox until it is covered in smoke and sparks, and let it be covered over the ankle area, the patient resting on his side.</end_of_turn And so cauterize with three cauteries around in one go.</end_of_turn
And so keep this for three days; then apply a plaster to the border and leave the wound open for several days; and take care that there is no inflammation until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Doctors say: or, children, of this kind of cautery few have used for the terror of the patient, and for that reason few have found that which please them concerning it.</end_of_turn
May these burns be applied to those who suffer from it, and find relief at that very place.
May the cautery be performed with two circles having an opening pierced in them, through which the fat should be squeezed out like the seeds from a pomegranate; let the length of the incision be as big as two hazelnuts or as many as those seeds.
And if the space between their thighs is of such a quantity as to contain the thickness of a finger; cover them with cushions and support them, so that they rest against each other in this way:
Then place your hand over the ankle and support the limb over the bone, compress your hand over the ankle; take cold water and pour it between two circles, and let the heat gradually decrease. The quality of that should be like that of a small flame. Keep it like that for the quantity of an hour, and endure the pain of the disease and the swelling of the limb — for indeed every other pain is like fire — until the pain ceases.</end_of_turn>
Then raise your hand towards the instrument and wipe away the cold water from the entire ankle with clean water.</end_of_turn>
Then leave it like that for three days and support the limb until the swelling of the limb has subsided; leave it like that for several days, and when the swelling has gone down; this is the end of the treatment.</end_of_turn>
And take care of those who are suffering from it until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
And if the pain extends to the thigh or the hip, make them sit in a position where they can contain water as is done for the ankle swelling.</start_of_turn>
This is the method of cold water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</start_of_turn Recipe for alkali and caustic not extinguished of both parts, take one part each, grind them and suspend them in a new liquid from which the part remaining is pierced with a small hole according to the quantity that enters into it.</start_of_turn
Then suspend the remaining liquid in another liquid and pour it over that alkali and caustic alive. Take hold of those with the thumb of your hand and compress them well, and see what comes out of the acute water in the limb towards the sent liquid.</start_of_turn
And adjust all that water, and take another live caustic and another renewed alkali, for that every hour that this is not done will cause great acute suffering, which is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, for that operation is like fire.</start_of_turn
And so of many medicines which are cauterized widely, some are quick and coarse and others are slow and gentle, and caus with sulfur added to them are more effective.</start_of_turn
And this is the story of an ancient man who underwent an operation for ankle and sciatica pain, and who praised the treatment, saying that no other treatment was necessary, and that he was healed by a mere glance as recommended, for that he recognized that this treatment was of great efficacy.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary to have certain herbs green, and if they are not found green, take fresh figs; take some of them crushed with a little gray and apply it to the ankle where the pain is, or in the thigh or hip, and bind it.</start_of_turn
And leave it on for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the disease allows before the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn
Then put it in water and when the limb is inflamed, take it out into the sun, for the pain will cease and it will be healed.</start_of_turn
Remember that no one should use these medicines without first evacuating the limb.</start_of_turn
Indeed I say that when a goat has a wound of the vein of the heel that is cauterized, take advantage of that opportunity; and perform the cautery in this manner: take wool and soak it in oil against the cold, and apply it between the toes of the foot and between the heel bones.</start_of_turn
Then take dry goat hair and burn it with fire until it is black; then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extended.</start_of_turn And repeat this process, and do not stop until the sensation of pain disappears and the pain is relieved.</start_of_turn

When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</end_of_turn
And therefore gout caused by excessive cold is cured with management and not by remaining idle, for the pain will remain until the cautery is made.</end_of_turn

And if more than these cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that and do not burn too much your hand with the cautery before, be it only for the sake of the code.</end_of_turn
And if the pain arises inside the bone and the two limbs, then administer the cautery which we have said in the preceding chapter.</end_of_turn

When there is a rupture in the joints and saying the bones are loosened from the skin towards the genitals, and when this is imminent, then you must order the patient to lie down and use soft cushions so that the wound coming from the belly will stop bleeding.
And immediately follow the patient between your thighs and order them to keep their thighs inside until the wound is closed or the skin or the bones reappear.
And immediately return that which is in the bowels and secure the rupture on the fifth bone and signal the limb which appears like a circle from the buttocks to the groin.
And immediately grasp the cautery which is like this:
until it is smooth and gets hair-like bristles. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn>
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn
And immediately stop the cautery when you put your hand over the sign which is on the hand, and when you have placed it until you see the fifth bone enter the middle of the heel; and repeat this until you have achieved it in the first attempt on the bone.</start_of_turn
And observe diligently the color of the intestine during the cautery, that you do not burn that intestine so that there is no death or other great harm to the patient.</start_of_turn
And remember that when you are performing the cautery you must not touch the bones, do not endanger your operation.</start_of_turn
And you must take care that the cautery of the children is subtle according to the great and the measure of them.</start_of_turn
And take care of the area of the cautery for three days with borders until the wound of the fire is healed.</start_of_turn
And take care of those who are with you until they are healed.</start_of_turn
And the patient should rest on the thighs for forty days until the wound and the swelling are sealed.</start_of_turn
And you must abstain from food for them according to the length of time of their cure, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort of healing.</start_of_turn
And when you want to take them away after forty days, the hour administer them food properly made, and keep them for other forty days.</start_of_turn
And be mindful of work and of the replenishment of food and drink, and of harsh speech, for when you use this regimen of treatment the whole woman will be healed.</start_of_turn

And I have already said that the first ruptures must be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this way, because it is signaled by a touch.</start_of_turn

Capital xlvii. - From the cautery of leprosy.
The books many times cauterize with a great instrument, and indeed if the species of leprosy that is caused by putrefaction of fat and melancholy.
And therefore when you want to cauterize it, consider if the leprosy is common or rare and cured by what we have said in the division and do not burn, neither this, and fear over the illness that the corruption comprehends all the body of the patient and all the entirety of it, for when you cauterize it over the head with two cautery instruments: one in the middle of the head, and the second at the back of the head, over the eyebrows; and two over the ears; and one behind, over the nape or servant.
And finally put your hand over the cautery a a little distance from the bone so that the scales are loosened from it, so that the exhalation of thick vapors is alleviated from it; and cauterize over the belly as much as is necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the illness and appears obvious, then it is necessary that you cauterize that with those same cautery instruments which we said on the head; and cauterize over the root of the nose, and two cautery instruments over the two big toes, and two cautery instruments over two vertebrae of the collarbone, and six cautery instruments over the vertebrae of the chest, and one large one over the vertebrae close to the navel, and one over the navel, and two over the ankles, and two over the muscles, and two the nails of the fingers; and cauterize that over all the joints of the fingers and toes, and over each nail of the fingers and toes, and over the hair of the head.
And guard yourself from the nerves which are over the heel that you do not burn those.
And many are cauterized with a cautery instrument over the bone of the thumb and another over the mouth of the stomach, and another over the heel bone.
And you know that when you adjust many cautery instruments, it is more beneficial and safer; and you know that the illness does not feel pain in the cautery, just as before, for the body is already stupefaied
And you know that the cautery instruments must be large or small according to the limbs and joints as it precedes the qualities of the instruments
And take care of the cautery with flour of barley and oil and another care that it is healthy.
Capital xlviii. - From the cautery of wounds of the body
From the cautery of the stupor of the body
When any limb is stiff or sleeping and is cured with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healthy, then you cauterize that stiff limb with a cautery instrument as it deserves the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it
And the testicles must be cauterized within the hardness of the testicles a little. And take care of that which is in the wound within that it is healthy
And many are cauterized any stupor which is due to the fingers and toes, and to the vertebrae of the chest and sometimes the sensation of the nerves which are inside that limb, and it is appeased the stupor.
Do not presume anything except that which is known in the anatomy of the limb and the exit of the nerves throughout the body

And take care of that with flour of barley and lentils with olive oil and rue leaves, and columb or heron's blood, give each a part and mix them all together, and put a bandage on it and keep the area still until it is healthy

When cancer is beginning and you want to remove that bone, then you cauterize that with a circular cautery instrument around its circumference as it is twisted
They say that it is cauterized behind the cautery in the middle area; however, I do not see that here, for I fear that it is ulcerated. Indeed, I have seen several similar cases.
It is better that it be cauterized in a circle around the area as we have already said, or at the most with a cautery.

From the cauterization of the diseased parts.
When any diseased part is delayed in maturation, and this is due either to excessive fatness, or for the state of the disease, which is old in decrepitude, or for lack of strength, or for the time, and you wish to expedite the maturation of the diseased parts; then cauterize in the circumference of them with small punctures; and thus you will make her expedite her maturation.</start_of_turn>
However, if you wish to perforate them with the cautery, then do so with the cautery of which this is the form: and stop that in the middle of the diseased parts until you have pierced the membrane.</start_of_turn

From the cauterization of the corrodents.</start_of_turn>
A corrodent is a wandering corruption in the limb, which consumes that as if with fire it consumes dry wood.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if sometimes that corrodent is in the place where you suffer from the cautery with fire, then you must cauterize with fine needles many or few according as is convenient in that place where it is corroding.</start_of_turn
And thus cauterize throughout the whole area until you have eradicated the whole corruption and there remains no cause of it.</start_of_turn
And thus leave it for three days, and suspend over the cauterized places until three days have passed with olive oil mixed in until the scabs are all eradicated and the whole corruption has gone.</start_of_turn
And take care that there be no wound left behind.</start_of_turn
However, if after three days the wound does not heal in the place where there is no corruption, it is not so; but if so, then repeat the cautery over that which is still corrupted.</start_of_turn
And a corrodent is treated in various ways with acute medicine, which is half in the place of cautery.</start_of_turn However, fire cautery is of greater utility together with other remedies.</start_of_turn

From the cauterization of nails and of the other like them.</start_of_turn
Many veins become swollen in the lower part of the foot which is called claw, and this is a great cause, making the foot swell; and it is cauterized in two ways, namely with fire and with lukewarm water.</start_of_turn
However, fire cautery is that you ignite the cautery cautiously resembling punishment, which is made of iron according to the quantity of the claw which you must cauterize throughout, and of fine stripes.</start_of_turn
And thus suspend the ignition over the claw, and with the other hand hold your hand over the cautery in the circumference of the claw until the cautery has reached the depth of the claw.</start_of_turn And leave it for three days until the limb gets well.</start_of_turn And thus cover that with coarse salt saved from the fields, and leave the plaster on that for a night, for that will be eradicated from its root.</start_of_turn
And take care of the place where the nail was generated until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if it does not heal, and many veins swell on the surface of the limb, mainly in the foot and ankle, then you must administer on those cauteries with lukewarm water, that is, take a little piece of lead or iron or punishment and put it on the claw; and pour a little lukewarm water over the piece, and hold your hand over it, and press the margin of the canula against the root of the claw, and keep the lukewarm water away from the root of the claw; and wait for the patient a little while for the biting of the lukewarm water for an hour, and then remove it, for the claw will have been eradicated from its root.</start_of_turn
And thus we must make an incision over those and approach the other from within, until we reach all of those which are within the body.
And thus we must take care that the root of the nails is eradicated with those incisions which the flesh sees engendered.</end_of_turn>

When boils appear on the body, and pus-filled wounds appear which are caused by corrupt thick matter; therefore at the beginning when they appear, it must be cauterized over the head of the fistula with a fine needle and thread, or over the root of the eroding long vessel; or with a slow cautery.</end_of_turn
And some physicians cauterize immediately at the beginning of their discharge according to this manner; and they do not hesitate, and by breaking up the excess they make them harmless, and heal them from those.</end_of_turn

Concerning the cautery of a wound of infection caused by an incision of the artery.</end_of_turn
Many physicians must deal with an arterial fistula which arises from the ulcer which must be excised, or from the incision of boils or cautery of the limb, and in such cases it is difficult to close that.</end_of_turn
Therefore when such an accident happens, you must immediately place your hand over the opening of the artery, and pause until blood flow from the wound has ceased, and that no more blood comes out.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop the bleeding with fine and coarse cauteries, several in number, and cool over those until they are no longer ignited.</end_of_turn
And immediately take from those a little or a great one according to the place and the ulcer from which the artery is broken, over that vein tightly hold back the bleeding until it has been closed and that blood flow has ceased.</end_of_turn
And if the wound is extruded from the opening of the artery when you have closed the vein and squeezed the cauteries, then take another cautery immediately alongside the previous ones which are prepared in the fire, and do not cease until the wound is closed.</end_of_turn
And take care that you do not burn the nerves that are here, and that you go on to another illness over the patient.</end_of_turn
And you must know that when an artery bursts, it is not possible to restrict the wound, and more so when the artery is large, except for one of four methods: either a cautery as we have said, or an extirpation when it is not extracted, or when it is extracted the limbs are burnt and the wound is closed, or that it is bound with thread or ligature to make a strong structure, or that it is held with medicines which have the property of restricting the wound; and that it is bound with powder or constriction downwards.</end_of_turn
But indeed those who administer decent restriction downwards with thread and stricture with cloths or by position of the causes burn rather than comfort.</end_of_turn
But if this happens when the physician is not present or the medicine is not available, then you must order the opening of that vein immediately as we have said, and understand with great attention the extent of the wound until the wound has completely separated from the ulcer, and that the artery is not clotted; and that over the artery you should sprinkle with cold water of great coldness until the wound is closed and hardened; and indeed do everything that is necessary for the cautery or the medicine.</end_of_turn
Concerning incisions and perforations and wounds and phlegmas and their similarities.</end_of_turn
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases in which the cautery is convenient and helpful, and the causes and occasions of these, and the instruments necessary for them, are to be set out in their proper order in the following chapters up to and including the feet.
And I shall proceed in this chapter concerning that matter which has been requested, so that what is desired may be relieved, as regards that concerning which demand has been made
And since I am about to speak of it, know that in this chapter is to be feared that which is in the first chapter of cautery.
And for that reason it is necessary to take great care, because in this operation there are many things which may cause evacuation of the intestines or the loosening of the bowels, which is dangerous for life, because of the bursting of a vein or incision on the abscess or opening of an ulcer or emptying of the plague or extraction of a splinter or incision of a stone. All these things are accompanied by fear and trembling and in most of them death is imminent.<end_turn>
And I admonish you that you should not attempt anything in this matter which is beyond your capacity, for there are many things which may cause you to behave like madmen or like those who are mad with diseases.</start> Therefore, it is better for you to depart from your disease than to die from it, and to help the gentleness of what you find in your disease, and for the length of your disease, and for the fear of the disease which signifies death.
And these are the things which I have said to you before and will say, hoping for your salvation, and your speedy recovery from your disease.
Therefore you should not consent to anything which is beyond your power; and your caution should be greater than your desire and your presumption about anything should not be made except for that which has certain knowledge which is useful to you and for which you have good reason to believe it will be successful
And use in the treatment of all these maladies the prognosis and the indication of them to which health is converted, because in that is to you the helper in the acquisition of fame and glory, of love and praise, and of lasting fame
Oh, children, God is with you and will teach you and direct you and protect you, for he is in your hand.
And I have ordained this chapter separately from the chapter of cautery, concerning the care of the head up to and including the feet, so that what you desire concerning what you need from what is above and what is below may be relieved
First Chapter.
Of the care of water which is contained in the head of children.
It is known that this disease is not without danger to children, for it is when the wet nurse opens the head of the child that life is taken from him.
And many times the cause of this is a hidden one which is not known
I have not seen this disease except in children; and in all those whom I have seen it, death has been imminent, and for this reason I have been left desolate in this matter
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and whose head was always so swollen that he could not support himself, even when carried, until he died, and that the moisture increased until death.
Or it is accumulated between the marrow and the bone, or between the bones over the cartilage
For if the moisture is between the marrow and the bone and the abscess is slight, then you must make a wound in the middle of the head with a fissure two fingers wide, until the moisture runs out, and this is the form of the cautery
And if the moisture is greatly increased and the abscess is large, then two wounds must be made according to this manner:
If the moisture is outside the bones, this is an indication that you have eaten too much of the head and the water is squeezed out when you press with your thumb against the parts around it, and this is not the moisture which is hidden away You must make three wounds in the middle of the head according to this manner:
And remove all the moisture from the incision; and strengthen the wounds with strips and cushions; and pour wine and oil over the wound until the fifth day; and then remove the ligature and care for the wound with sponges and compresses, and strengthen the head equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the limb is healed and healthy
E es otra manera de incisión, que consideras hon la magnitud del apostema y la colección del agua, porque algunas veces la vejez es mayor en el occipicio, o en la parte denante, o en la derecha, o en la izquierda; y por tanto atención a la incisión donde aparece el apostema y la repleción del agua, y fén aquo según que a tú es más posible.
Observe that you must not cut the artery, and that when the blood flows out freely from the wound, it brings relief to the patient by evacuating the humidity.
Chapter III
When there are boils or carbuncles on the heel or foot, and it has been a long time, and one does not trust in the healing power of medicines, then the best cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
Therefore cover when you want to make the incision so that the patient does not feel pain, and bring a rough sponge to the area to expose the arteries, and strengthen the patient's chest against the pain; and consider where the vein is located.  And the places where any of these are close to the heels depressed, and do not uncover anything except for a few bones.
And do the same with regard to the surrounding area, and make the incision of each part that is acutely painful at the incision to reach the bone, and do this for the width of the head.
And if you wish, you can remove the surrounding tissue and tie off the artery at the incisions of the parts above
And the length of the incision should be two fingers wide, because when any vein is incised the blood is ejected with a pulsatile flow, which leaps up frequently.
More if the artery does not appear at the incision, however cover that you measure the heel to determine the amount of space of three fingers, and do the same with regard to the surrounding area, and do this until you reach the bone
And what you must gather of the blood is the amount of a thumb and a little finger.<end_turn> and do not take too much or too little, but as much as appears from the virtue of the patient and the replenishment of the artery in them.<end_turn>
And consider the plague, and therefore if anything remains on the bone of any cause of swelling, then do the incision so that no abscess arises from the cautery.<end_turn
And strengthen the swelling with sponges and with silk thread of silk, and care for that which is within until it is healed.<end_turn
Chapter III
Regarding the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples<end_turn>
When ancient or acute boils or abscesses occur due to agricultural humidity or for the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or so ancient and resembling those, and when these cannot be cured by the methods of medical treatment, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples or to the cauterization of those in this way as we have shown.<end_turn
And the manner of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient should support those that are in the temples; and understand that the artery that appears in the temple is the one that you have shown by the mark, and that it is hidden except for a few bones due to the intensity of the heat.
And if it is hidden, then strengthen the patient's chest with some support; and bring a rough sponge or evaporate the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly. And then you take hold of the sponge in this way: And you grasp the thumb with your thumb and index finger and grasp the skin with your middle and ring fingers, and extract that which is above until you extract that from the heel and uncover that from the tunic which is left behind, from all parts.<end_turn
And if the artery is small, then you wrap that around the end of the toe, and make an incision of that part according to the extent to which the toes are swollen and contracted, and do not cut the blood supply, for if it is not cut it will not cure the blood of all the parts.<end_turn
And evacuate blood from the thumb and a little finger. End of book.
If the wound is large, it is necessary to ligate it in two places with strong silk or strong thread, and do not close it up until the pus has dried up and the wound has consolidated.
And immediately reduce the excess which is between two ligaments; and do so at that moment or at another convenient time.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, cauterize that which is within the bone within the bone cavity before the extremities are incisions are made, and stop that work in place of that matter.</end_of_turn>
It is better work when the patient has a fever or is suffering from scalded complexion; because the cautery is of those causes which aid the drying humors, and therefore is better in judgment.</end_of_turn
Cover also the extraction of the arteries that you see in the place of the old wound, and keep them covered with fine powder adequately made, and do so either with herbs or dry medicines which cause the flesh to swell and become soft until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if while working another one sees the flow of blood from the artery, then in that hour you must restrict that blood, or the cautery, or that which fills the wound, and hold your hand over that place until the bleeding is stopped.</end_of_turn And if for no other reason you are not present, then suspend the bleeding from the wound until the blood has congealed, and cover the wound with lukewarm water until the acute pain has ceased, and strengthen as much as you can.</end_of_turn
And what is more curious in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein at this point having two hooks, because you have marked the two places at the attempt, and you have stopped any other, except for fire, until the bone is reached and the vein is divided in two places, so that it is elongated what is between the extremities of them, which are not consolidated at all by this cautery.</end_of_turn>
This is the form of the cautery:</end_turn
And the sharpness of the two hooks is equal.</end_turn More importantly, if their sharpness is less than two hooks, it is better, because if their sharpness is too great near any part of the body, it will burn the flesh too quickly.</end_of_turn
Therefore when there is any thickness, keep the fire's heat in those places and the flesh will be gently separated.</end_of_turn
This work is better in all work and lighter.</end_of_turn
And the space between the two hooks is the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</end_of_turn
Chapter four.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of the limbs affected by the acute and acid humors of the bones.</end_of_turn
When the humors are acid, and the veins which are above the head of the tibia are affected, do not consult for any reason about the treatment of medicine, for the face of the patient will already be swollen and will be sitting in the chair like ants, and the bones of that limb will be extended, softened more than they were known to be, and the nails will be scaled by the sharpness of the tears, which is an old custom in the treatment of these operations, and now that treatment is done without space.</end_of_turn
And you command the patient to raise his knees towards you, and immediately make three incisions equally distant according to the length of the face.</end> And if the length of the incision is two fingers: one incision should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the face, and the second according to the length a little bit below the tear ducts, and the third at the other end.</end_of_turn
And guard yourself from the cutting of the arteries which are in two places, and lengthen your hand from the continuation of both mandibles.</end_of_turn And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers adjusted.</end_of_turn
And if you have a piece of sponge or dry cloth moistened with these which you will use to absorb the blood.</end_of_turn
And immediately between the two sharp extremities, this is the form of the incision: that is from the root of the temples to the second incision.</end_of_turn> Excise at that whole the cord which is between two incisions over the bone, and do so with the point which is over the bone in the middle of the incision.</end_of_turn And so, after having scraped this space and having put in the first incision, another instrument is introduced, which is called the cutellar, blunt at one end and sharp at the other.
Then stop the flow of blood from that blunt end towards the fatty part, and the blood from the loin does not reach the bone.  Close up that which has reached the middle fissure, and ligate all the blood vessels that go down from the head to the feet
Maybe the incision should be continued until after the loin, and so make the other incision in the middle fissure enter the other fissure.
And when the amount is sufficient has gone out, press the parts of the body of the patient with a cloth.
And so stop in any old wound of the knee, and stop over those dusts covered in oil and vinegar and oil agar, which must not be left behind after the cautery.
And on the third day remove the ligament and administer a great effusion of cold or tepid water, and so care that there is ointment of beeswax with olive oil and other things that the wounds may be healed

The care of the eyes for the care of the limbs descends from the parts around the head.
When to some extent of acute catarrh continues, and sometimes the limbs of the patient extend little, and already with regard to them it is necessary to take care, ulcers appear on the eyelids and their edges become rough, and in the front of the head there is sharp pain and subsequent vomiting, the hours of greatest danger for these accidents are when the matter and the catarrh do not descend from the veins of the parts surrounding the head
And the best care for these is this: that you order the patient to rest his front, and so make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a little for the width (and begin with the incision at the left temporal vein going to the right temporal vein; and let the incision be inside the bone; and lengthen your hand from the lacerations of the temples which are bitten by the chewing).
Drain all the blood with sponges or dry gauze and so fill between the two lips of the incision with wax or cloth of lead And so keep away from the wound with dust covered in oil and vinegar to prevent it from leaving behind after the cautery
And when you have drained it and you see that the swelling has already diminished, the hour is that you should harden the bones until they begin to yield, and so care for that which regulates the evacuation which makes the bone yield as if you took from flour two parts and from barley four parts and mixed them, or like that make plaster and administer it to these wounds of the newly born bone

The care of that which is in the ankles.
Every cause which comes to be in the ankles is of four kinds, either mineral stone or that which seems like stone, such as iron and ivory, or that which is of plant origin such as thistle or bean, or that which is due to flux, such as vinegar and oil agar or something similar
And therefore when the stone comes to be in the ankle or any other cause similar to these does not adjust or does not grow in the ankle, and stops the ankle from the sun, and if sometimes the stone is ejected in any of these causes of oil and vinegar or something similar, and so administer the extraction of it, and make it vomit with condiment, and pack the wound from the event of vomiting. And so stop in the circumference of the ankle some parts of fat or bandage, and extend the ankle to the parts above, because the matters which are swollen are forceless with these causes.
And if it is not forceless, the hour administer the extraction of it with the instrument called gesti epicicarios subtle of which this is the form:
And if it is swollen with the thumb, well; and if not, the hour administer the extraction of it with an instrument of little duplication.
And therefore if it is not swollen by this, the hour make a canula of gutta and insert the extremity of the canula into the cavity of the ankle and close around the canula with wax and oiled material to prevent it from being torn except for the canula itself And so extract with the belly well drawn with great attraction, because strong matters which have been mentioned are seen.
Maybe if it is not swollen in this way, the hour takes hold of the limb with a cold or wet cloth which has been taken from the armpit, and places it on the extremity of the ray, and so covers over that part conveniently stopped And thus we draw out the one in the ankle with ease, and expel the ankle from the moisture.
And if it is not necessary for all of the causes which we have mentioned, then you should restrain the one biting or spitting that is causing the pain of apostema, whether from cautery or spasm.</end_of_turn>
And the way to treat that is to touch the patient’s pulse and extract the cause according to the virtue of the parts, and thus do that which causes the fissure between the bones of the ankle to appear, and make a small incision in the heel of the ankle where the bone is black and soft.</end_of_turn> And if the fracture is of a crescent shape until it reaches the heel, and the heel is grasped, hold that if possible with appropriate instruments; and do so with speed, and care that it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the cause of the pain in the ankle is one of the humors that grows and inflates, then administer the antidote and extract it; even if you do not obey my orders precisely, take some sponge from this way: And administer that which is the abscission of that humor which is causing the pain in the ankle.</end_of_turn>
And do not delay when you think that one has already been moistened by the vapor of the ankle, and keep it in soft parts, and thus expel it from those with nails or with a sponge, or as we have said, relief is found in the expulsion of it.</end_of_turn>
But in the water that enters the ankle, use that the patient should perform a sternutation at the beginning, and fill the ankle with a little bit of old cloth, and place your hand over that ankle in which the water is, and if by this means the pain is not expelled, it is not necessary; but if not, take hold of the patient’s toes and knees according to the length of the finger, and clench them in the fire for a while, and the patient put one of those in the opening of the ankle and jumps on the other foot beside that limb and strikes with the other foot on the foot that is causing the ankle to bend.</end_of_turn> Therefore do not stop until all the water has been expelled.</end_of_turn>
Therefore do not stop until all the water has been expelled.</end_of_turn> And indeed when the water has been expelled in this way, take paper or sponge.</end_of_turn And put one extremity in the ankle and extend the other extremity in the fire until the majority of it is burned.</end_of_turn
And thus put on another sponge and do so until all the water has been expelled, and draw out that which is said to be the external bone.</end_of_turn
But in the extraction of the beast that enters that ankle, if it is little, do so with care and hold it still, as we have said in the division; but if it is of great size which causes fear of immediate damage, then administer the extraction with nails and nails, and the cause of the pain is less severe than all the other causes that cause pain in the ankle.</end_of_turn
But in the extraction of worms that are engendered in the ankle, when you have cured that which we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and you do not suffer the antidote, then you must cover the ankle with the sun.</end_of_turn
And thus if any cause of the worms appears, then extract that with nails or fine nails, even if no cause appears, then take a needle from behind and pull it wide open from which this is the shape of them.</end_of_turn And draw out the limb slightly from the ankle according to the quantity that the pain suffers; and thus apply pressure with that which is useful for pressure, and do so until all the worms have been expelled.</end_of_turn
But if you do not obey my orders precisely, then take hold and close the hole of the needle as we have said; then administer distillations which have already been proved useful in the cure of worms, and find out in the treatise on distillations.</end_of_turn
And be your effusion with which oily medicines are applied to the ankle with this instrument of which this is the shape.</end_of_turn And do so with silver or lead, from behind, with a small hole, and put on the palm of your hand.</end_of_turn
And thus be as when you are grasping the circumference of the needle here where it is necessary.</end_of_turn And if you wish, take the sponge and wrap it around the limb adequately with a coat, and pour oil into the hollow of the limb, or juice of any herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines in the needle – and that is in the ankle – and then draw out the sponge with your hand and press with your hand that which is the temper of the limb until the oil has been expelled from the hollow of the limb and the pain has ceased to feel the oil within.
And that which is infiltrated in the heel has already been scorched with fire for a little. Keep in mind that the cause which you will distill in the heel should not be too hot, because the medicines for the heel do not tolerate it.</end_of_turn>

Care for the ointment of the heel.</end_of_turn>
Some mothers of children who have eaten large amounts of food without perforating their bellies, and that which has already happened to some men, should be oiled in the meat of the heel for the plague or for nothing in particular; and this oiling of some is useful in the preon of the heel which does not succeed at once, and some in the outer parts.</end_of_turn
And that which happens in the preon of the heel, which does not succeed at once, is in the greatest degree of difficult healing.</end_of_turn
And in that in which you succeed at once, cover that you stop the heel of the patient towards the sunlight and rest in that.</end_of_turn And therefore if sometimes the ointment appears, open that which is the cause of it, which is the fine sand from which this is made.</end_of_turn
If the limb in which it is small is of which one part is acute and the other not; and the sand is of two lions so that it does not make a wound in the heel.</end_of_turn
And therefore if the ointment is for nothing born in the heel or in the meat of the limb, then do so with those sharp nails and prick that with great ease until all the meat is gone.</end_of_turn
And if the ointment is in the preon of the heel, then take fine sand from a lion and burn that little fire, and then put that in the meat of the heel.</end_of_turn
And therefore if you smell ointment in that with which the patient finds it easier, for gravity to help, try to press the oppression of it easily; and keep in mind that you do not touch the nerves of the heel.</end_of_turn
And thus leave the heel covered with lint according to the quantity of the breadth of the wound which you have enveloped in Egyptian unguent; and do this for several days until you are certain of the consolidation of the plague; or that you take some and bury that under vinegar and powder over it and use it; and if sometimes the heel has already become softened, then cover that which you have taken out and replace it with another which you will cover in fat that is useful for oil rubbing, until the swelling has gone down; and then care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Or if there is a flux of pus, then immerse sponges or cloth in cold water and put them on the heel, and use another remedy which restricts the flow of pus, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with several lines of medical advice, but the provided portion does not contain any further translation.)</end_of_turn
Care for the paleness which is caused by the eyes.</end_of_turn
The paleness which is caused by the eyes of the heels is sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.</end_of_turn
Therefore keep those which have nails or claws, and burn those which have hair or bristles, and quickly stop on the places where you have scratched.</end>
Or if there is pain with a flux of pus, then you cauterize those which are like lancets on the surface.</end_of_turn>
And the best cauterization is when the incisions and troops go away when any cause of those bristles has gone away; and when they are cauterized with fire, those bristles are consumed and do not return.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with several lines of medical advice, but the provided portion does not contain any further translation.)</end_of_turn
Care for great swelling which occurs in the eyes of the heels.</end_of_turn
Many causes arise in the eyes of the heels which are assembled to cause swelling in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called great swelling.</end_of_turn
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the inner eyelid and outside.</end_of_turn
Therefore the operation in them is that you consider whether the swelling is due to the inward part of the eye and is widespread throughout; and the cause is light.</end_of_turn
Therefore, perform a flank incision over that fissure for the width, and then drain that from all parts easily as it escapes, and suspend that which remains once the other has gone.
If the figure is large, adjust it with sutures; and care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If it is small, do not be excessive in that which may aggravate it; restore the limb and leave it be cured.</end_of_turn
If the greatness is declining at the edge of the wound, you must stretch the wound; then remove the greatness entirely, suspend it once more, since if you have cut too deeply, you will not cause any damage.</end_of_turn
Then close the incision, wash the area with saltwater; and care for the area until it is healed.</end_of_turn
End of text.</start_of_turn>
The care of the wound is complete after the washing of the wound area.</start_of_turn
Grayness is generated in the tunics of the wound from the children, more so in the young, because they cause the hair to fall out and darken it; and it does not prevent the brilliance of the sun because the fat covers them.</start_of_turn
Therefore, at times those who are working on the faces do so at all times, and over the faces they sleep; and over their faces they leave their eyebrows wet, which have already covered the inflammation, and the imminent appearance of swelling is on the heel; and that when you press the area with your thumb, you will find swelling within them.</start_of_turn
Every manner of operating is in that in which the physician suspends the patient’s head over the belly and grasps his limbs and makes a circle according to the amount of air contained throughout, and suspends that which is above and presses on the thumb of the area to bring about an increase in swelling in the middle of the circle, and then performs the flank incision over that moisture which has descended from the surface of the wound for the width, and the incision is not to be greater than the incision which is made in phlegm.</start_of_turn
Therefore, before you complete the incision, that you should have made the swelling throughout reach the swelling, because in the meantime there proceeds swelling of the wound according to the shape of white fat.</start_of_turn
Therefore, extract that which you have enveloped with the draps between the thumbs and index fingers and rotate between the right and left hands until it is dispersed.</start_of_turn
And take care that you do not press too tightly in the incision so that the moisture does not reach the wound and remove the covering.</start_of_turn
If you do not see the swelling appear at the beginning of the incision, nevertheless, press in the incision a little to facilitate the swelling; and then extract that which we have said; and then cover with a wet cloth and vinegar and place over the area and remove those which are like dust.</start_of_turn
And so when it is necessary to drain pus from the wound, place it in the concavity of the incision so that what remains of that moisture is absorbed.</start_of_turn
And care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If in the area around the wound there is pus after the cautery, care for that with absorbent dressings until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Methods of wound care.</start_of_turn
When in the eyes of the patients the natural tears are born from the adjustment of the eyebrows, then these cause the eyes to water and make various methods of illness appear, such as excessive tears and the softening of the eyebrows and the loosening of the membrane until such time as that which is the cause of the destruction of the eye which is called the tarsus, and care must be taken in four ways: by cautery of the focus; or by acute medicine as is said in the chapter of cautery; or by the application of an astringent for incision and suture; or by cannas as I will say.</start_of_turn
Therefore, you must suspend the patient’s head over the belly; convert the thumb of the right hand to your left hand, and if converted, it is not so; otherwise, insert the needle into that place where it is firm from the part of the pus which is left from the eyebrow, and when you have pierced it put your thumb over the part where the tears are born, and convert that which is above into the ray.</start_of_turn
The point of the needle should be inserted at the outer corner of the eye, where the lacrimal gland meets the tear duct; then extract the needle and leave a small amount of soot or ash on the eyelid, and press gently over the eye with your thumb, like a leaf of myrtle.
However, it must be known that the degree of swelling of the eyelid varies between individuals, so that some people require that the larger part of the tear duct be injected according to the degree of swelling.
And thus perform the operation at the place where you have marked the two lines, starting from the major tear duct into the minor one. And if the wound is deep like that of a royal beard.
And place the sponge on one of the two corners of the wound, then remove the whole thing, and with the thumb and index finger of the other hand grasp the two lips and pull them towards the gut or toward the thread, and pull out the intestines, and if you wish, sew up what remains of the intestines over two eyelashes with various stitches, or leave it open as it is.</end_turn>
And remove the stitches from the intestines within three or four days, and take care of the wound.</end_turn>
If you wish, leave the wound open and suture, and take care of it as before, because the swelling of the eyelid is alleviated by the closure of the wound and the adhesion of the edges; in this way there is less need to taxanize.</end_turn
However, in this case it is more urgent to address the patient's suffering, and it is a good operation, so do not be afraid.</end_turn
Another way of tying is to make a sign on the eyelid like a leaf of myrtle, and to raise the eyelid with three fingers spread apart and gathered together in this way:
If this is not possible, take hold of the nails, and if they are not blunt, take a needle with a thread and pass the thread through the middle of the sign, and pass the other thread alongside the major tear duct, and the thread alongside the minor tear duct, and adjust between the two threads mentioned above so that they are equal, and then place your hand over the area and elevate the whole wound as much as possible, as we have recommended.</end_turn><end_turn>
And adjust the two lips of the wound with stitches, and care for the wound until it is healed.</end_turn><end_turn>
If after this there should happen to be swelling beyond the wound or the incision, do not be afraid of it, but keep it moistened and clean, and apply ointment.</end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
Every herb that is applied to the eyelid that has become sensitive from the wound should be discontinued, because in this case it is better to use what we have already mentioned regarding the wound; in this way there is less need for stitching.</end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
Taxanizing in this way is like this:</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn> And you convert the eyelid and split the sign that is inside as I have described; and then make two needles or two fine pins whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the sponge.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn> And you have already pierced at the extremities of each part where you have the threads.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
Then add some slight thickness under the excess of the eyelid above, and tighten the pins of each part with great strength, and leave it like that for several days, because the wound will be very painful and will swell, and will probably fall out by itself as soon as it has been tightened.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
And if it is late, break the stitches at the root of the eyelashes, and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
And thus when it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the nails do not penetrate.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
This is the way to make two needles like this:</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn> And there is the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>

Of the elevation of the nails in the eye when the skin is tough.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
When the cause of the pain is unnatural, such as harsh and biting cold, and when the patient cries out due to the pain, it is appropriate to take an awl and pierce the flesh at the navel or below the navel, and immediately seize the extremities so that they do not move in an unnatural way. And the length of the incision should be as great as the breadth of a palm
And immediately take two other awls and leave them in their place briefly, and do not touch the extremities of the patient if you wish to do so
Then hold the patient's head in the groin, and let the sun be your witness so that your work will be declared, for it is a subtle and minor operation
Then insert the needle at the root of the hair adjusted as necessary, and make that penetrate the skin rapidly until you have extracted the foreign matter from the natural hair
Then draw out the hair together and insert it into an ointment, and keep it there for a few moments, up to three but no more
Then draw your hand over that which has been left behind until the hair is completely expelled with the ointment in the skin of the natural hair
More ointment can be applied outside than that which has been applied inside, but do not remove the hair until the ointment has been thoroughly absorbed through the wound.
And when the physician has observed the color of the wound, when the ointment has been applied and the pain has subsided, and when the patient cries out with a groan or cough, let the wound be closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to the skin and grows out again naturally
If the hair is finer than that which is natural, then adjust a hair of a similar length, and elevate it as such, or that you leave it until it has grown out to an equal extent, and when it has grown out, elevate that.

Of the care of the wound which appears in the eye socket
When the eye is irritated, and the eyelid is contracted when it is stretched to the right or to the left, because of bad consolidation of pus or of a wound or of a burn, and is called leporine, and this can be either natural or accidental, and is useful for consolidating pus or wounds or burns, or for preventing them from becoming worse
The manner in which to perform the operation is that you make that consolidation and separate the eyelids, and place in them a little piece of lead, and bind them until they are healed
And do not neglect to apply care to the wound from the causes which cause it, because if you do the pus will return more fiercely than ever before.
Use in these cases something that softens, such as fennel, and soak in the water in which they are placed, or ointment of aloe, which is liquefied with some oil, and immerse in that the lead, and care for that
The treasure of your care is that you perforate with all skill that is not consolidated in the manner that we formerly did at the beginning
And this operation that we have mentioned, is nothing other than the rectification of the leporine that does not restore the shape of the eye socket as it was before
Chapter XIV
Of the care of the wound which is useful in the outer part of the eye socket
The wound which is useful in the outer part of the eye socket is called vertadierament, and is either natural or accidental
More often it is useful for pus or for a wound or for a burn or for other things of that kind
The way to perform the operation is that you take a needle in which you make a double thread, and leave that in the flesh, and pass the thread from the left lacrimal sac to the right lacrimal sac, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
And immediately extend the flesh around the needle with the needle and hold that with the needle, and make an incision at a sufficient distance from the needle Therefore if you restore the figure of the eye socket as it should be, it is well done; but if not, take hold of the thread and stop that in the indented figure, and from that convert the eye socket, and make the two incisions on the side of the outer eye socket.
And the two extremities of the two incisions are at two angles of the incision, which has been made so that when they meet together they form a perfect figure
The figure depicted is the Greek letter: lambda.
Then keep the amount that is in the guts outside of them, so that the pressure is relieved from the pupil
Then tighten the separated parts and keep those along the thread of silk; and take care of those as we said of the mollifying medicines and the calamus within which must be health
And if it be necessary to suture for a wound or cautery or puncture, then cover that the wound is made flat over the margin of the pupil as it is said before. Then separate the cloth between two lips as it has been said
In the sum of the words of the care of the alxacrati when it is detached or left, that it runs in its operation, according as it is prepared in the manner of alxacrati, and that is in the manner of diverse masses.
And the wise artists always prepare an engine in any way possible so that it makes return the figure to its natural form, or in that way, and that disease according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the greatest disposal
End of document
Of the adherence of the pupil to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When these adhesion happen among many people it is necessary to solidify the pupil more detached from the limb of the pupil, and to prevent the facility of movement and its natural works, therefore cover that you remove the emission of rays from the pupil, and raise it up, or extend it with the nail
And immediately touch the adhesion with soft sponge, which is not of the sharpness of the incisions, having made obtuse a small hole so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and keep the sponge so that it does not dry out the pupil in its sharpness
And your incision should be such that it does not irritate that adhesion until the pupil is returned to its natural form and that the adhesion is completely healed
And put on the pupil salt water in which you wash; or distill from it vinegar dissolved in water
And separate between the pupil and the pupil by a piece of cloth of linen, and rest on the pupil a thread of gauze infused with alum, and use three times daily cataplastics until it is healed
End of document
Of the incision of the nail and the emergence of the glands of tears
Know that the nail is according to two manners, either it is nervous, and it is similar to a hard soft sponge; or it is non-nervous, similar to white moisture solidified, which when you touch it, or force it to take it with the nail, it breaks and the nail is not fixed in it
And both kinds do not begin until from the greater lacrimal until it gradually covers the sight and prevents the light and the movement of the pupil
The manner of working in the incision of these is that the patient should keep their head bowed over the abdomen, and put their hands on the pupils, and raise the pupil with your hand, and collect the nail with the nail of little duplication and extend that to the surrounding area And immediately take a needle and enter into that a piece of horsehair or of barley or of beef or of something similar, or of strong thread, or gradually double the extremity of the needle and put that in the middle of the nail, and penetrate that with the needle, and tie with thread the nail; and extend that to the surrounding area, and scrape with the skin the side of the nail which if necessary will cause the pupil to dilate And thus keep that which is behind inside outwards
And immediately touch the incision with soft sponge or with small forceps, and leave the natural secretion of the lacrimal so that by incision of that no water of tears flows continuously
And sometimes the nail is extended with the natural nail or with thread, as we have said, and immediately make it protrude with sponge of which this is the form of it:
Beware that on the sponge do not touch the corneal membrane and that you avoid breaking it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Immediately put on the pupil a little salt or ointment to make it slippery, and leave that in for a while; and take care of that which covers within that it is not dry until it is healed
If the nail is not sensitive and cannot tolerate the needle, nor if it is deeply embedded in that area, then in such cases the doctor should use medicines to cure this kind of nail, and it is healed in the same way as before and is recommended in division.
If you wish to cut it out, then open the wound of the patient and take a small piece of sponge moistened with alcohol according to this method: with moderation.</start_of_turn> And if sometimes that is rare and is hidden and comes in that way, then let the doctor distill from your wound in the smell of the head to make it secrete or make it weep or sprinkle salt, and let the smell go into the other day.</start_of_turn>
Then repeat over that operation until all that is of it is gone, except that the after-burn remains. Let the doctor then learn that, and cure the after-burn at the beginning so that it is healed.</start_of_turn
And repeat your operation about that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
The discharge of the tear duct, if you notice it in the wound for a long time, suspend it with oil; and prick that one out of that part, and do not finish the incision so that no pus flows from the tears.</start_of_turn
And let it distill in the tear duct head to make it secrete until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the incision of some herbs and of what is born of a plant adjusted in the wound.</start_of_turn
Some herbs that grow on the hills are born of a rough plant, and it is over-seated until it covers the pupil, or approaches or expands over the eyelids and tightens the eyelids against the eyelashes and is gathered like a cushion.</start_of_turn
May the operation on them be that the patient suspends his head in the belly if necessary; and then open the parts of that and collect all that rough plant with oil convenient to the wound, and take oil with a forceps or a basket; and then prick the rough plant at the beginning until all is finished with the incision, and keep you from bleeding that part of your operation.</start_of_turn
And let your incision be like that in which we have recommended to prick the nail, or with small forceps with which it is collected together as it will come in this chapter.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the incision is complete and all that rough plant is removed, then let the doctor fill the wound with powdered salt, or let it drip in powder form and resemble the corrosive medicines, and keep it covered with a bandage of wool until it is sure that the after-burn is gone.</start_of_turn
And if there remains any cause of herbs and it is overcome with great care, and you fear after-burn, then let the doctor learn the wound and care for that after-burn with oil until that after-burn disappears, and repeat over that until it is healed, and do the same with the rough plant that happened in this kind of wound.</start_of_turn
But you must know that all the care of the head wound by nature or by chance, or by iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that that limb is suffering from that operation.</start_of_turn

Of the collection of hair in the wound.</start_of_turn
Hairy veins that are seen on the wound are to be treated with care, and it is forbidden for the patient to move for a certain number of days.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the hair in which the wound is strong and in which there is no other disease of hair, then collect that hair.</start_of_turn
And command the patient to suspend his head in the belly if necessary, and then suspend those veins with an oil or two as you please; and let that oil be doubled in duplication according to this method:</start_of_turn
or two oils gradually in a vessel according to this method:</start_of_turn
And let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with moderation, and take away the skin hour by hour, until all those veins are removed from the wound and are relaxed.</start_of_turn
And keep that you do not bleed the wound at the extremities of the sponge; and if your operation is in the morning before sunset, and if you stay firm in your operation that you do not prick anything except those veins.</start_of_turn
When you have completed your preparations, then you will release the patient's head downwards or towards the heel so that you can assess the degree of their pain.
Even if this is not possible at this moment, and you place all your attention on what causes their pain, and read them for a few days until the pain has subsided and the cause of the pain is identified and secured with cautery.</end_of_turn>
And repeat this procedure until the patient is healed.</end_of_turn>

On the reduction of hernias to the navel.</end_of_turn
When you treat hernias with cautery or with acute medicine, according to what is narrated previously and is not healed, then do not be ashamed to make an incision on their apostema in order to extract the maturity of the hernia, and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is revealed.</end_of_turn
And when the bone is revealed and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, then you should grasp it with this instrument:
And it is called an asper grasp, which is made without handles, and the head is round like a nail, pierced with five or six punctures of lime or with fine punctures (as it is in the following form).</end_of_turn
And hold that over the corrupted part of the bone, and rotate that between the thighs mentioned, and press your small hand gently until you know that that corruption is gone.</end_of_turn
And when all this is done, restore the limb with desiccant and astringent causes.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the limb is consolidated and there is good flesh in it, and the belly of the wound is separated from the body for forty days, and it is not renewed or apostematized and there is no accident in it, then you know that it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Otherwise, do not be ashamed to reduce the wound to the shape of the navel, and according to this method: if you discover it with iron or acute medicine, and when the bone is revealed, then grasp it according to this method:</end_of_turn
The handle of the instrument is triangular, and the head is first extended towards the limb as sometimes happens.</end_of_turn
And hold that over the bone, and take hold of the lacrimal; extend your hand a little of the way, and rotate your hand towards the grasp until you have grasped the whole bone, and you will know that you have grasped it well when you feel the pain disappear as soon as you remove your hand.</end_of_turn
Therefore, restore the limb with astringent and desiccant medications like this.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when the flesh and the limb are hardened, the matter which flowed outwards from the wound returns to the navel, so that this is more curious about the pain.</end_of_turn

On the reduction of the prominence of the head.</end_of_turn
When the head swells completely and does not occur at night or diminish, then you must loosen the pain and follow it, and keep the patient calm and still; and put on the head liniment which is made of beeswax, aloe, vinegar and ochre, and apply a thick layer of plaster on the head with powder.</end_of_turn
And the method of the powder is that you take lion's mane cloths and fold each one in four; and make powder from these cloths.</end_of_turn

Capitol XXI.
From the initiation of the eminence of the outer tunic
When there is disruption in the outer tunic, and it is prominent and proceeds outside the eyelashes like a barleycorn, and it is necessary to remove it, it is recommended that you enter the needle at the radix of the outer tunic from the outside inwards, and then put the needle back in the place where there is a double fold of the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate and loosen the first needle according to its situation; and then insert the needle into the place of the double fold and bring that part of the outer tunic into the circuit of the needle, and tighten that knot.
And then remove the needle and rest upon the bloody lanula infused in albumin of blood and loosen until the thread comes out at the root of the hair.
And then care for the blood vessel so that it be comfortable when the wound is healed
Several veins gather together throughout the circumference of the wound within the vicinity of the prominent eminence, and when they are perforated with the sharp instrument that comes to the head of the wound, the albuminous moisture runs out, and the wound descends and enters quickly
And tighten until it is healed
Capitol XXII.
On the care of aloes
This disease which is called aloes is nothing other than a wound which is adjusted in the blood vessel resembling descending water and is not like that.
More diligently work on it so that the patient does not become more swollen and painful on the part affected, and take hold of his head with your two hands when you see the wound becoming healed towards the lower parts, and keep it dry and do not let it descend, and keep your hand over it, so that the patient may see the causes of the wound just as before.
And if it does not descend downwards, it is because it is water.
More if it is not prepared to descend downwards with the water as we have said, however, the patient does suffer between the palms of his hands and the patient takes hold of a pointed cautery and puts it on that part above the nail of the thumb where the conjunctiva meets the cornea in the circle (in the middle of the eye), until the wound is expelled.
Therefore when it is expelled, then you distill in the blood vessel cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And keep it treated with the other causes until it is healed.
Capitol XXII.
On the care of the descending water of the blood vessel.
We have already said concerning the species of water in the division and what is necessary to perforate with certainty, however
You must keep the patient still between the palms of your hands over the swelling and hold the blood vessel steady.
And then rest your left hand on the lower eyelid if the blood vessel is on the left; or with your right hand if it is on the right
And with your right hand take the sponge, if the blood vessel is on the left; or with your left hand if it is on the right
And keep the extremity of the sponge towards the crown for the thickness of the iris in the albumin of the blood from the part of the lacrimal gland, and gently press the sponge against the wound and rotate your hand over it
And penetrate into the blood vessel and sit that the sponge has already reached its purpose because of its weight
Keep that the measure of the sponge from the preon is equal to the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the black spot, that is the crown of the eye; so that you may see through that pupil with the vision of the eye for the clarity of the corneal tunicle.
And then withdraw the sponge from the place where the water is, and put another sponge under it immediately, so that if the water descends too much, the patient will see the wound so much covered by it that it will blind him, and the sponge in the blood vessel.
And rest a moment; therefore if the water has descended, then immediately take away that other sponge which you put under the sponge which has been expelled.
Therefore, when the weather is dry and warm, extract the bile easily with some facility, and mix a little of pure salt with some vinegar and at the same time wash the area with lukewarm water; then wipe away the bile with a cloth or bandage of wool and oil, and wash with the water again.
More recently, we have seen these things happen in our time, resting upon those who suffer from such indigestion with oil of poppy seed.
If you do not obey your bile when it enters the belly because of its hardness — which is the case with many men of whom the bile is very thick —, then you must take a sponge which is called " alberid" in this way:
Therefore, pierce at that junction there, and do not touch your hand to the wound, otherwise you will make the bile go astray from its natural course.
And then bring out the bile as we have said.
You must congratulate them on their work, whether they are prepared to sleep in the patient's bed downstairs or are prohibited from any movement
Stay away from the patient's nature so that their nature may be calm, and do not move their seat forward or backward at all
And keep them quiet according to their condition for the third day.
And remove that person from that gloomy bed and expose the cold air, and let them see some causes, and then return the liament within seven days.
Do not do anything in the hour of care or at any other time related to the infusion. Indeed, you must keep the water away from them so that it does not cause them to become excited and aggressive towards you on account of their great and fierce hunger.
If, however, the vomiting persists, you must remove the bile by the seventh day, and correct that which is responsible for the vomiting
Then withdraw from their sight and rest your hands on their oral face for which reason you must keep them quiet for a few days, as they exist in the gloomy bed
And gradually remove from that bed and converse with them about their causes
And you must know that in no way is it permitted for the disciple of vision to see anything of those things, and you must be careful about the operation
And it has already been reported to us by some of those who have seen the Lord that when the water is sucked out of the bladder through the opening made by the perforation, the water comes out with great force.
Indeed, however, we have not seen anything like this in our land, nor have we read of it in the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is a new thing.</start_turn>
These are the forms of the magpies which are about those who do not know about those things:

Chapter XXV.</start_turn>
Of the care of the flesh nothing is in its nature.
When there are various meats in the body which are adjusted to each other, of which there is some cause which is like a scorpion's head with teeth, or like a multitude of fish; this disease is called "polypus" which is like that fish represented.</start_turn><end_turn> And it is like cancer of the flesh, ulcerous, of pale color; and it is like the flesh of a lion not of pale color.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore, in that which is like these lion's meats which are neither fraudulent nor cancerous, you must make the patient lie down between your thighs and place him in the sun, uncover his parts, and prick his belly once in those meats.</start_turn><end_turn And then extract that from the parts, and then infiltrate the water which you have understood from those things until you know that all the flesh is already consumed; for if there remains any cause from which the opening is possible, then you must retreat the water with one of the subtle instruments with facility until there remains no cause.</start_turn><end_turn Indeed, if the Lord wills or if vomiting persists, then you must stop giving the water; or if it is malignant vomiting, you must cover it up and cauterize that until it is separated from the soul and all the cavities are closed.</start_turn><end_turn
And immediately take hold of the nose, close the opening of the vein with vinegar or wine. If the nose is congested and there is moisture inside the palate, it is known that it is already healed.</end_of_turn>
If the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is no pus in the pores of the nose, which is what causes the swelling.</end_of_turn>
Therefore you must enter firmly with your hand into the cavity of the nose, without moving the nose, and wait a while until the bleeding stops.
When the bleeding has stopped, that is when you should smell inside the nose to see if the blood has drained from the nose's channels, and once it is gone, take away the handkerchief that was placed there. Note that children often faint from this action, and this is a light cause of it.</end_of_turn>
Then take away both hands from the nose, one that comes out and the other that remains in the nose, and immediately apply cold compresses to the nose, holding them there until you see that the bleeding has stopped.</end_of_turn
Then extract the blood, and close the nose immediately by pressing with the thumb against the bone, and do this for three days or more until the wound has healed.</end_of_turn>
And at the end of the treatment, insert a lead cannula into the nose to prevent bleeding for several days until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If you take care of the treatment, use this remedy.</end_of_turn>
And this is the form of the instrument for capturing the maker of the ointment that is distilled with oils and medicines in the nose.</end_of_turn
It is made of silver or gold, which is similar to a small lamp with a wick, as thick as a nail, and the head is similar.</end_of_turn
Or make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the capturing instrument maker is flat, uncovered; to which you must attach the thumb of your hand, which you must hold when you extract the oil or water from the suckers and causes.</end_of_turn
End of treatment. XXV.</end_of_turn>
From this time forward, the patient will remain in the nose's extremities.</end_of_turn
The fainting of the patient is normal in the extremities of the nose, and is magnificent and commendable for five days until the patient recovers accordingly.</end_of_turn
And for this reason you must take note of the beginning of the appearance of the symptoms, and report everything.</end_of_turn And immediately stop over the wound or cautery or medicine that was placed on the wound.</end_of_turn
If it is delayed in its appearance, but is magnificent, consider whether it is bloody, dark, of a yellow color, and without sensation; do not touch that which is the cause of the apostem of the cranium, because its great malice causes this.</end_of_turn
If the apostem is of a reddish color and is not dark, and when the infection begins it is possible in all of them, then evacuate the patient and apply that remedy, and take care of the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn

You must know that when continuity is dissolved in one of these cartilages, little confidence is had in that operation except in the case of very wise people.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you must do something for some cause of these, consider if it is fresh plague on the face, and when you have adjusted the two lips of the plague with sutures, take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the soles of the patient's solution of continuity have already been separated, and any part is healthy, then you must scrub away a part of the apparent codena until it is healed. And so adjust the two layers near the suture and strengthen them, and over them sprinkle salt and powder, and place over the powder a pad of lint or another of the solidifying plasters, and leave that bound for two days or three, and then remove that and replace it with another, and leave that in place until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn>

When on the surface of the teeth in the parts inside and outside and between the gums there are adjusted rough scales, legs, and some are black and are citrine or green because of the corruption of the gum, which is harmful to the teeth that are left.</end>
Therefore you must remove the disease from between your teeth and suspend the cap of the tongue in the belly, and scrape the teeth in which those scales appear until no harmful cause remains, and what remains of the blackness and the citrine color and the others that may be modified.</end>
And if this remains at the beginning of the cause, it is not; and if not, then you must repeat the cause on the other side on the second and third days until the last degree is reached in what you wish.</end
And know that teeth have needed various forms of movement and various figures according to how it is prepared for your operation.</end><end_turn> Therefore the razors with which the tooth is shaved from the inside part are different from the razors with which it is shaved between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of shaving must be prepared by you, which you will see soon.</end
Chapter XXX.</end_turn
Of the extraction of teeth.</end_turn
Therefore you must treat the tooth of its pain with all your skill and later in the whole eradication of it, for there is no cause that replaces the substance of the tooth when it is eradicated, which is a sublime substance that is excused in the eradication of it.</end
Moreover, when the disease is urgent that tooth must be eradicated, you must firmly declare that it is the painful tooth, for many substances deceive the disease and cause that it be in a healthy tooth, and you must eradicate that and the pain will cease until the painful and diseased tooth is eradicated, as we have seen in the operation of the barbers.</end
Therefore you must be certified that this is the painful tooth, and that you know well, that you must mark on the circumference of the tooth with a spatula in which there is any virtue, until it is dissolved from the root of the tooth throughout, and you must do that with your hands or with fine forceps from the beginning gradually until that is complete.</end
And now let someone strong hold the patient's shoulders firmly for good speaking or stupor, and keep the patient's head between the thighs that he does not move, and then draw the tooth according to the rule in a manner that neither the patient nor the greater pain does not increase.
And if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and put it on his hands from every part to facilitate and expedite the removal of the tumor as it is done from the beginning
But if the tooth is fractured or rotten, then take care that you cover your hand with that cloth and grasp that with the tip of your thumb so that it is not fractured when you tighten it up on that area that you hold
And take care that you work diligently with sacrifice throughout the circumference of the gums and that you keep your hand firm so that you do not fracture that, and remain still from it, and return to the patient for the malice that is greater than the first pain of his foot.
And keep in mind that you do not do anything that ignorant barbers do in their fisting and audacity regarding the extirpation of their teeth, since they do not administer what has been recommended; for many veined patients make come greater evils than those that have been mentioned, and the causes of their miseries remain hidden, or some of them, or that they extract that tooth without any bones of the mandible as many veined patients have testified
And for the extirpation of the teeth, let the mouth be washed with wine that has been boiled or wine with salt.
And if blood flows out from the saint to aid, as many veined patients do, then take any amount of saffron and sprinkle it on the plague, and if you do not confirm that saffron, cauterize.</end_of_turn>
The form of the forceps and needles which are useful for grasping the tooth at the beginning is either of long handle and wide mouth, or of short handle and broad, so that they are not bent when working on them.</end_of_turn>
And thus sometimes with a broad mouth and sometimes with a short handle, as soon as you begin with those, they are not bent, but if they are short handled they are stretched out.</end_of_turn>
And they are useful of Indian steel descending as well as of bronze handles, and in the handling of those, teeth are introduced one into the other and are tightened with strong constriction. Some of the veined patients make the handles like the beak of a heron, so it is round, and are of strong constriction.</end_of_turn
Chapter xxxi.</end_of_turn>
Of the extirpation of teeth and the extraction of the bones of the mandibles fractured.</end_of_turn>
When the tooth is fractured and remains for some cause, then you must keep your hand over the wound border for a day or two until the wound is softened; and then bring in relief or support the handles which are assembled like the beak of a heron called ciconia or round, of the form of the forceps:
The handles are useful both as lime or as aloe.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey your will with these forceps or needles, then you must fall upon the reason and uncover all the bone and insert the instrument which has the name of atali, so it is a small lever whose form is like this:</start_of_turn>
And be of short handle large a little, and do not be grasped so that it is fractured.</start_of_turn
Therefore if for this the reason is forgotten, do not do it; but if you do, help with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular handle in which there is any thickness:</start_of_turn
The form of the second instrument is that it is triangular and of more subtle handle.</start_of_turn
And already you have helped with this instrument having two slopes of which this is the form close to the following:</start_of_turn And with other instruments which I will enumerate in the shaving of teeth; for help is useful with this instrument which is assembled like an onion, and this is the form:</start_of_turn
Of the triangular handle that is thick or short, which is any thickness, and do not be grasped so that it is fractured.</start_of_turn
And other things that the instruments of the teeth are like those mentioned above.</start_of_turn
However, the learned and skillful artists in the art, finds for themselves the means according to what he understands of the operation and the various diseases; for these are the diseases for which the ancients did not say or even advise any proper instrument, for the forms of various species.</start_of_turn
May be if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or if necessary, the pain is cured upon that which is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and it helps you with the way in which this is done.
And in any great or small degree, and be it tight or loose at the mouth so that it does not escape or run until the bone is completely healed; and then restore the place with appropriate medicines at that which is convenient.</end_of_turn>
May be if the bone is slightly broken, reduce that of that break and of its blackness, and cure that until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Of the care of prominent teeth over the others.</end_turn>
When teeth are prominent beyond their natural shape for those of the same kind, and especially when they encroach upon the gums, and especially upon the holy lips; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is not properly aligned with another tooth, and it is not possible to file or ligate it, the pain must remain in that place; but if it is not attached to another tooth, you must insert that instrument into this area which has this shape; and it is like cutting through pork, and is done with a sharp iron of India for extraction.</end_of_turn
And let your incision be at the place where you insert that instrument for several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not similar to that of other teeth.</end_of_turn
And if a prominent tooth is exposed to filing, then file that with a file of iron of India which has this shape:</end_of_turn
And let it be all of iron of India and the margin be well-marked; and let there be little points as if with a needle, with which the tooth is filed little by little in several days with ease, so that it is not like other teeth which are jagged.</end_of_turn And then line that at the end, and reduce that which is in the socket.</end_of_turn
And if a tooth of which a part is fractured and the tongue is bleeding, the pain must cover that until the expectation of that fragment is overcome and equalized, and be filled so that the tongue does not bleed nor the word corrupt.</end_of_turn

Of the restoration of decayed teeth with gold or silver foil.</end_turn
When accidents happen to the teeth before concussion and removal by percussion or extraction, and the patient does not suffer from pain, and you have cured that with soothing medicines, and it has not been of use, the pain must be remedied by placing gold which is strong in those which are strong, and not of silver which becomes green and is soon weak, even though it is more expensive.</end_of_turn
And let the gold be in such flexibility and roughness as the quantity which must enter between the teeth; and the way of placing is that you take hold of the gold and take twice its length between two healthy teeth, and that you make it grow between two crooked surfaces of the gold between two decayed teeth, or if one or two, until the tissue reaches the healthy tooth of the other side.</end_of_turn And then repeat the tissue inside the part from which you started, and strengthen your hand with ease and wisdom until it is not decayed.</end_of_turn
And let your striction be at the place where you strengthen the gold must not escape.</end_of_turn
And then remove the excess of the gold with forceps or pliers, and add those to the area where you are working, and convert those and hide them between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue.</end_of_turn And thus read that again carefully.</end_of_turn
And if it is slipped or rough, strengthen that or those with another gold in such a way at all times.</end_of_turn
And this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two decayed teeth, as sometimes these are linked:
And when you return a tooth or two back in place near some other, and they have fallen out, let them recede as we have recommended, and let them remain.</end>
Do not do anything except a good craftsman and a wise man.</end_of_turn>
Many herbs are suitable for various causes of bone fractures, and it is useful to them as a kind of tooth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is absent, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.</end_of_turn
Capitol .xxxiv.
The text reads: "From the beginning of the ligament which is seen in the tongue and prevents that."
This ligament which is seen in the tongue and prevents that ... This ligament which is seen to leave the tongue some veins or is naturally associated with it, or is accidental and caused by an infection which has already hardened.
And the operation for it is that we burn the mouth of the disease, that is, the soft palate which exists in the belly; and elevate the soft palate, and then we cut that ligament of nerves as far as it is necessary until the tongue is freed from its retraction.
Maybe there is some hardness or denudation, and that is because of the consolidation of the infection; however, when you have cut once and split that (ligament) as far as necessary until you have cut the ligament and the nodulation has been dissolved
And take care that there is no tear in the preparation of the flesh and that you cut here the arteries and let blood flow freely.
And then wash the remnants of the incision with oil or vinegar or with cold water; and then leave the tongue loose; so is the cause of which the patient has left the tongue in any night so that it is not consolidated again by any vein.
Maybe there is bleeding of blood, leave your hand over the great toe which is treated; maybe the blood boils, then cauterize the area with a pointed cautery which you will apply to the blood. And then take care of the other causes until it is healed.

Extraction of wisdom tooth leaves the tongue.
Some veins accidentally leave the tongue swollen like a small nail which hinders the natural operation of the tongue; and because of that it is greatly increased until the mouth is dry
And the operation for it is that we burn the mouth of the disease sitting in front of the sun and consider the swelling.
And if sometimes you see a yellow or black, dark spot, tough, to which the patient does not feel sensation, then do not touch that which is wrinkled.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then put on your glove and cut that with a sharp lancet, and cut it out completely; and if blood boils at the time of your operation, then leave your hand over the great toe which is treated, so that it is not dry, until the blood is contained
And then return to your work until you have finished with it, until it is washed with oil or vinegar and salt; and take care of the other care for the blood until it is healed

Extraction of wisdom tooth of two carpal bones and of that which is nothing in the heel and of the other wisdom teeth.
When the wisdom tooth is embedded in the jaw, so are the glands which are assembled together and which are causing the pain, they are two carpal bones which when you treat them with water as we have said in the division and they are not healed, then you consider if the wisdom tooth is tough, yellow, without sensation, then do not touch that which is bleeding
And if it is of black color and the root is large, then do not touch that which is bleeding for the flow of blood; take away that which is soft, and you can either extract that or leave it broken by itself
And if it is of white color, soft, and the root is slight, then that which is that must be cut out.
And the operation for it is that you consider, before your operation, if the wisdom tooth has already rested calm for a complete rest or if it is diminished by any diminution; and when you have done that, burn the mouth of the patient, put the head of the patient in the belly, and burn the mouth of the patient, and the servant takes between his hands the tongue of the patient leaving aside noble instruments of which this is the form:
And it is done with silver or with gold, and it is slight like a tile.
Therefore when you promise that to the patient and he shows you the wisdom tooth, and you put your hand over that which is in the belly, then take your glove and stay there, and pull that out to the outside as much as you can Another one which you must pull out is the cause of the tunicas, and then cut that with that instrument of which this is the form
Another one which you must pull out is the cause of the tunicas, and then cut that with that instrument of which this is the form And it is assembled like forceps, however the extremities of these are bent, so that the orifice of each one is in the belly of the other, not acute, which is iron inside.
If this instrument is not at your disposal, the mark of this spatum is that it is acute at one end and blunt at the other.
And since you have made an incision, now make the other according to this manner of handling, and immediately apply cold water to the patient to prevent swelling
If blood flows too freely, keep cold water of decoction of meadowsweet or ivy leaves and adhere to what has been said concerning the causes until the flow of blood is restricted, and take care of that which has been said to be healthy.</start_of_turn>
And every vegetable that grows in the ground, others after these two ankles, and make an incision according to what has been said and as I have said concerning the incision of two holes that equal.
And I have already treated a a woman of apostemas who was born in the ground of her, who had a tendency to dark color, little sensation, who had already closed the ground of her, and the woman breathed with difficulty, and I had already forbidden her to eat and drink water, and she was already on the verge of death if more water had not been given for a day or two.</start_of_turn>
And the apostema had already protruded so much that there were two ramps between that and the heel for two steps.</start_of_turn>
Therefore I stitched it up fistulously and remained on one of its sides, and I pulled out that which was large from it, and I threw it away from me, and I immediately closed that which I had left open, and I squeezed its tongue, and I put its thumb in that apostema.</start_of_turn
And I immediately bled away a great part of it, and it did not run from it except for a little blood.</start_of_turn Therefore the ground of that woman is absolutely healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and to eat food, so I did not cease to make an incision of that apostema for a long time, and afterwards there appeared another apostema in its place, which I also incised as long as that.</start_of_turn
Therefore I pray and cauterize the ground of her, so that there will be no more addiction; and immediately I went out and did not stop until I saw that God had mercy on me concerning that.</start_of_turn

From the incision of the heel when it is apostematized.
When the heel discharges downwards, and it is apostematized and is long, the hour is not called perpendicular; and if it is in the outer part large and round, and the hour is called bubbly.</start_of_turn
If when it is cured with the water that we have said in the division, and you do not take care of your wound, and sometimes the apostema is burnt out already and is subtle, the hour covers that you must make an incision which is round; and if it is in that length, and there is blood, of a dark color or black, and it is not at the center, the hour covers that you must fear the incision of it, because there is fear of the patient.</start_of_turn
And when you do it according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, that you make the patient groan and press the tongue with the instrument with which you shape it, and immediately put the thumb on the new one and throw away the old one, and make an incision with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned at the incision of two holes.</start_of_turn
And cover that you do not make an incision except when it is adjusted according to the natural term of its addiction, because if you make it more, you will make it worse.</start_of_turn
And immediately after the incision, use the water which we have recommended at the incision of two holes, and take care of that which is healthy.</start_of_turn
If the patient is frightened by the incision of the heel, cover that you use an instrument in the cauterization of the heel in your fear, and the manner of the cautery is nothing but acute water, and that you keep the head of the patient still, and immediately press the tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and immediately take some water which we have mentioned in the chapter of cauterization, and comfort that which is alive, and stop that which is not thick or subtle, and from that fill the hollow of the instrument which has this shape.
As well as the bending of the cavity in which the medicine is placed is like the curvature of the heel of a ray, and stop the instrument with the medicine on the nail, the patient will lick over the lips for so that he spits or wipes away the mucus from the mouth of that because of the intrinsic medicine, for so that there is no discharge from that of any cause over the ground of the heel and that he recover that.</start_of_turn
And keep your hand firmly on the medicine, and express it over the uvula for about a minute until it becomes numb and sedated by the bite of the medicine.
If you wish, take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of the ray, and immerse the cotton in the medicine, and put the ray onto the cotton in a tube so that the cotton adheres to the tube, and do so until you have achieved what you desire from the cautery of the uvula, and then remove that which makes it dry and fall away in about three or four days.</end_of_turn>
If you doubt that the medicine has been completely absorbed, repeat it, and when you have finished cauterizing the uvula, remove that which is in the circuit of the ray above the coto, and apply something that will harden that which is in the circuit of the medicine, and wash with cold water, and cure with ointment, and bind with bandages until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And this kind of treatment is more useful than the beginning and more long-lasting.
Some diseases of the uvula are cured with things that are more subtle than cautery and more beneficial, which is cured by fumigation in this way: mix cinnamon, rue, origanum, rosemary, bitter almonds, chamomile, broth and similar herbs, and add all these things together, or some of them, in a bowl, and pour vinegar over them, and let them bubble; and let the vinegar be poured onto the area of the bowl steadily, and under the vinegar there should be a sponge, on which should be placed an instrument of iron according to this manner; let it be made of silver or iron.</end_of_turn>
And let the limb be introduced into the mouth of the patient until the vapor makes the uvula rise above the canula, until the uvula is not opaque.</end_of_turn
And repeat over that swelling until it is dry, and keep that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the swelling, because it would be too severe for the swelling, and would not be enough to cure it, but you must declare the swelling to be over after performing this treatment.</end_of_turn>
Or if you do not have this instrument, take a tube and apply in the limb a cloth of wool, so that the mouth of the patient is covered, because the cloth of wool prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.</end_of_turn
This treatment is good for health.</end_of_turn>
(The text continues with additional medical advice.)</start_of_turn>
Of extraction of splinters and of that which adheres in the cavity and of the other causes.</start_of_turn
Swelling adheres in the cavity or spine of the foot or any other cause.</start_of_turn
Then cover that which appears to be causing the swelling, on which you cast your glance, with a pointed instrument of steel, so that you can be informed of what is in the cavity.</start_of_turn
And that which is hidden in the cavity, cover that you vomit the patient while the food is still in the stomach, because it strengthens the underlying cause of the swelling if it is left undigested; or that you swallow the patient a spoonful of bread or radish or a spoonful of dry bread; or give her a spoonful of sponge of marine lime, which you must bind firmly with faith, and hold that firmly in place. Or take an eel and bind it firmly with thread, and keep it bound; or take a bowl and bind it firmly with thread.</start_of_turn
And if the underlying causes have not been removed, take an instrument of lead according to this manner:
And it should be thicker than a ray, and in the limb there should be a cavity in which you put your finger into the cavity of the patient.</start_of_turn
And keep the patient’s head elevated above his heart, and keep that your touch of the hand does not touch the belly, so that you do not damage the bones or the spine, or that the physician put his hand on it.</start_of_turn
However, if the patient vomits excessively, because of his knowledge of the location of the underlying cause and of the swelling in his belly, he should remove his hand from the instrument in his hand, as much as he is able, until it is expelled.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXIX.</start_of_turn>
Of the extraction of blood clot which is annexed to the cavity.</start_of_turn
When blood is medicated with what has been said in the division of care with medicines and not confirmed, consider the hour in the patient's groin towards the sunlight, because you have compressed the tongue of the patient with the instrument which you have recommended.
Therefore if sometimes the bloodsucker, extract that one which is small or slightly sticky downwards adequately.</end_of_turn>
And if it is not possible to extract from that, take a curved needle and insert it into the patient's groin, and place on the concave side of the needle a burning iron, and do this until the bloodsucker is dead and remains outside the cavity.</end_of_turn
And then prepare a basin full of cold water, open its mouth in that, and wash the mouth with that; and do not allow anything to pass from that until an hour has passed, since the bloodsucker has suffered as much as when the water is cold.</end_of_turn
However if it is not recommended in that which we have said, the hour overshadows the patient with their head bowed or stifled by the instrument which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.</end_of_turn>
Do thus, so that it falls away.</end_of_turn>
This is another way of operating in the fumigation of that, that you take a bowl in which are burning coals and cover the bowl with a cover in the middle of which is a hook, and compose that hook on the extremity of the instrument; and then withdraw the cover from the fumigation; and place the patient's mouth over the extremity of the needle, and close the patient's mouth so that the fumigation is not too strong until you know that the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, since the bloodsucker has fallen away.</end_of_turn
And if it does not fall away, the hour repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, eating salty foods and other things, and do not drink water, and if necessary is that in this regimen is excluded.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is treated from the groin when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in this way, but it is curved in some way: which is placed upon the groin, and the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which is inserted the thumb, so that when any cause is compressed, that does not bite.</end_of_turn
The text ends here.</end_of_turn>
In which is the sum of the words in praise of the termination of ailments and sections of them.</end_of_turn
The apostemas are various, of various methods, as it is remembered from some of them in this book.</end_of_turn
And they are various in perforation and section of them by two methods, one for the kind of apostemas in themselves; and for what they compress of humors.</end_of_turn
And the second method is for the places where the ailments occur, because the apostema that occurs in the head is different from the apostema that occurs in the buttocks; and the apostema in the fleshy part is different from the apostema that occurs in the joint; and each one of them is its own judgment for operation.</end_of_turn
And there are some apostemas that should not be perforated but only at the right time of the illness in those or in addition to them.</end_of_turn
So other apostemas which must be grasped when they are crossed, and are not matured according to their complement, just as apostemas which are proper for joints, for an apostem which is in a joint, the thing is to prolong it until it becomes poor in the circumference of it, and that it does not corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because it is a harmful cause of contraction of that limb; or that it is a prop of the main limb, and if you delay the perforation of it when it is matured it does not help the main limb; or that it is proper of the buttocks, so perforate it only when it is not matured; and do not perforate it blindly, without completing digestion, but only that which is proper of the buttocks, so that you do not weaken the heel of the buttock and that it is elongated to the parts below the buttock, and that there is a fistula, or that it is beneficial in the end that it is not healthy.</end_of_turn It is better that you know the time of the perforation of the apostema, and that is when it is matured.</end_of_turn
And you know that it is matured when there is the cessation of pain and the ceasing of fever, and also the diminution of swelling and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the apostema, and the other signs.</end_of_turn
The wound must be closed from below the groin towards the navel, and comes from the care of the prominence.
The wound must be closed along the length of the limb or body, if the abscesses are in the armpits or the feet, and in the places of the lacerations, of the nerves' cords, of the arteries; and finally, in all places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use perforation as in that limb.</end_of_turn>
More when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then you must let the wound close until the digestion of the abscess is confirmed according to custom, as we have said; for if you perforate it before, you prolong the suffering of the patient and cause more pain, and you harden the edges of the wound and its depth.</end_of_turn>
More abscesses must be perforated according to the breadth of the limb or the body as necessary, or according to what the limb digests.</end_of_turn>
And you must give a small perforation, and in large abscesses great perforation and wide or many sections according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.</end_of_turn
And others are the abscesses in which you must make the cordena concave and inflamed, when it is finished that it should already be stiff, as in the case of trops of boils and abscesses.</end_of_turn
And of those that are incised with section having three angles; and of those that are incised thus like the figure of a ivy leaf, thus the abscesses of the armpits.</end_of_turn
And of those there are those in which round section and lunar section are administered, and they resemble the latter.</end_of_turn
More of those to whom it is not possible like external abscesses, you must perforate that with superficial perforation, or only flat.</end_of_turn
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, that you perforate that and do not hesitate to extract all of that in that hour; having extracted from that a part, then you must fill the abscess again the next day, and extract another part the next day, and so make that the pus becomes softened gradually until it is forgotten.</end>
And more if the patient is of cold temperament, or a woman in her period, or a small child, or an old man in decrepitude, for the animal spirit is resolved with the evacuation of the pus, and thus the patient is relieved, and you must leave it like that.</end
Be careful to keep this chapter with great care, and when you perforate these abscesses, that you remove the boils and consider whether the boil of the abscess is little or is a flat section, when you administer which of them or of the coto in antic; and if the abscess is large and the cracks of the perforation are many, that you stop mechanically in any place until they have healed together.</end
And if in the abscess a part of the cordena has been broken or has sunk into the surrounding area, that you must support it with old cloth or with thread of silk, just as when you have brought bread or cheese, because of its humidity; and strengthen that within the third day; and then proceed with that and care for it so that it heals without any inflammation until it is healed.</end
More if an outflow of pus occurs in the hour of your operation, then you must administer cold water and vinegar in which there is a thread of silk, and stop that over the place of the outflow of the pus until the pus becomes softened.</end
More if the outflow of the pus continues, then you must administer regimen and care and the powders which I have recommended in many places of this our book and division.</end
More if it is in winter, and the place of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you must cover with powder in wine and oil caut, and put those on the places.</end>
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy, then you must cover with powder in almonds with water and oil or in wine and oil, and all that until the third day, as we have said, and then you must remove the abscess and extract that, and administer the care that is appropriate for it until it is healed.</end
And thus is what is necessary for the cognition of the care of abscesses universally, more according to the way of distinction that I have already said of every abscess in what way it is to be cared for according to the chapters singly.</end
Chapter LXI.</end>
Of the section of abscesses which are in the cordena of the head.</end
The small bones at the ankle are connected by nodes that contain sacs filled with fluid; and these sacs move freely.
They are like small pearls, and in those there is moisture similar to wax.</end_of_turn> And in those there are those that contain moisture similar to resin, resembling stones; and those are hard.</end_of_turn>
And in the section of all this, and in the extraction of these, there is no fear, as when you extend these does not cause damage to the artery.</end_of_turn>
The operation of extracting these is that you grasp them with an instrument of the kind that you see, which is called tweezers, until you believe that it contains.</end_of_turn>
For if that which is contained is moisture, then split that by section according to its length by superficial section in this way:</end_of_turn
And begin in the section from the line of B to the line of G. So when the moisture is evacuated, then you wipe away that from which that moisture was contained, and do not leave from that any cause of this, for if there remains from that any cause, it will return.</end_of_turn>
And immediately immerse the limb in Egyptian unguents, if there is any, or in water and salt; and fill that with the ointment and leave that until tomorrow, for that which is corrupted will be consumed by that.</end_of_turn
And repeat over that limb with Egyptian unguents several times if you wish, until you believe that there is no longer any cause of that limb; for the ointment will cure the wound while it is healing.</end_of_turn
And if the ankle contains fat nodes, then you pierce that as follows:</end> with a section having the shape of a cross, and grasp nails between two lips of the section and tear that from all around, and exert your skill in extracting the sac which contains that.</end>
May it be that your artery is damaged by this, but I will tell you first.</end>
And similarly do in the lapizated ankle of section and care according as you have been told; and the section of the lapizated ankle is less severe, for it has little pain and little moisture.</end
And many times these veins are liable to these ankles which are in the head in bones which have no moisture; the cause of which is that I do not know of any ankle in the head of an old woman which does not swell like a deaf stone, rough, white, which cannot be softened, and if any of those is struck in that place, the ankle will swell.</end
But in the other ankles there is another thing which is not in this book, namely the ankles which are found in the heads of children, and you must take the reason for the swelling of the ankles, for indeed the section of these is superficial section.</end
And stop the perforation of those from the lower part downwards so that the body of the pain is relieved in the lower parts.</start
And take care of those with water as you consider convenient for the care of the wound.</start
Chapter LII.</start
Of the section of the scrofulas which occur in the ankle.</start
Moistened veins cause these ankles to swell in the heel and in the instep and in the ankle; and some veins cause swelling in the other parts of the body.</start
And so those which happen in the heel, and those which are generated between them, and all the scrofula of these is due to the rupture of their own sac, just as in the nodes and ankle of the head, as we have recounted.</start
And the species of these scrofulas are moist, for some of them are like stones, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant which do not obey treatment.</start
Therefore in that case when you have good opportunity in the touch, of which the color of the liquid that is manifested is appropriate for the color of the heel, and it is bad throughout, and is not annexed to the nerves of the heel, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not a swelling, you must pierce that which is like superficial skin of the part from the part beyond the body of the line G within the line B, and remove that from all around, and stretch two lips of the heel on an inch, or on nails if necessary, as we have said concerning the ankles of the head, and extract that little by little.</start
Beware lest the vein or nerve be injured.
Do not make the wound too acute, for thereby you may damage the patient, or irritate the illness, and you may thereby introduce something which is not necessary to introduce; for if you cut the vein or artery, you will prevent the flow of blood, and this will delay the healing of the wound, and cause further suffering. When the blood has clotted.
Therefore return to your operation when you have completed it
And inquire whether there is any other small swelling, for these also must be cut away and drained.</end_of_turn>
If it is in the root of the large vein, cover that the while time you are cutting away that swelling.</end_of_turn> Then cover that with a firm bandage and keep it there until it has fallen out by itself.</end_of_turn>
And then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in vinegar, and then care for that.</end_of_turn
And if you cut away the entire swelling, then cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and extract as much pus as possible so that there is no excess liquid.</end_of_turn>
More often, however, if there is still excess liquid due to the great size of the swelling, cover that you understand how to cut away the root of that, and remove that and administer stitches and what is said.</end_of_turn
And as for those swellings which contain moisture, pierce that superficial perforation here where you see the mature parts of them, and do not perforate further than that, for if you do you will bring pus from below the belly, just as we have said.</end_of_turn
And administer the perforation cautiously, warming it in vinegar and keeping it wet, so that it will not irritate the surrounding area.</end_of_turn And when the wound has already healed, then care for it by applying ointment of generative ointment until it is healed.</end_of_turn
End of Document.</end_of_turn>
From the incision of the heel of the foot to the healing of the wound it is necessary to keep the patient under observation.
I say that this section has never been known in our land.</end_of_turn>
This is the inscription of the sermon of these people.</end_of_turn
In women it is not advisable to extract the heel, for this may cause damage to the veins and arteries of the patient.</end_of_turn
In those who have swellings caused by bites in the mouth or swelling or two abscesses, when the disease is not in the bone, it is useful to perform an excision of the heel to prevent the loss which is caused by perforation.</end_of_turn
Therefore we must say that when we wish to perform an excision of the heel, we must make three circles around the circle of the heel, or four if the section is to be extensive, for the quantity between two circles is great; and the section should be made in fat, not in cartilage, for this place is private of fat and the vessels of blood of the heel are loosened.</end_of_turn
And if the doctor is inexperienced, cover that he should extend the tendon of the heel with an incision, and then open the tendon until it reaches the canal, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any cause.</end_of_turn
And administer the incision according to what we have recommended; and it is significant to perform the section of the canal for the inflammation which is caused by that pus which is from it and for the rupture of the voice.</end_of_turn
Leave the wound open for some time.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the hour has passed in which the perforation is feared, add two lips to the edge of the wound, and cut only the cartilage.</end_of_turn
And administer medicines that will cause the fat to disappear until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Indeed, the sum of the sayings which we have recommended is that the exposure is nothing other than to see that some of these abscesses have already rendered the heel of the foot useless, and that the disease is overcome within death, and the marrow of it is dried up, and the fat is separated from it, and the latter goes to perforate the epiglottis so that the disease can escape through the wound on every breath, and is saved from death.</end_of_turn
And thus I command you to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed; for the malice of the disease lasts for three days; therefore I command you to close the wound when the disease is gone, and heal that which remains.
And thus I have seen for my purpose that a maid brought a pot and poured it into his groin and burned him with that a part of the edge of the lung, and I was called to his care, and I wiped away the mucus just as it is moved from the dead, and I uncovered the wound and wiped away the pus that was in it little by little.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I confess that there was neither vein nor nerve injured, and that the swelling went down from the wound, and I cured that when it was healed.</end_of_turn>
And I did not blame the maid if she remained hoarse, and after a few days she returned to perfect health.</end_of_turn>
And now I say that in the section of the groin there is no fear.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn>
Of the section concerning the swelling that happens outside the groin, and it is called hernia of the groin.</end_of_turn
This swelling which is called hernia of the groin is great according to the color of the body, and it is not in women.</end_of_turn
And it is according to two methods, either it is natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
And in the natural it is not capable of healing.</end_of_turn
And the accidental is according to two methods, one is like grass knots, and the other is like a swelling which is caused by the bursting of an artery, and in that there is fear.</end_of_turn It is not necessary to fear it as with iron except for that which is small.</end_of_turn And you must know that if you find it like grass knots, and if it is not suspended from any vein, then you must prick it just as if it were a node, and extract that which is under the skin and the pus; but if not, it is necessary to examine all the groin to see if there is anything else that requires care, and to take care of that which is necessary until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn
Of the section concerning the species of nodes.</end_of_turn
Of the nodes there are many species, and I have already mentioned all the species in the division.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary to know the difference between a node and an extrusion in order to avoid doubt.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that an extrusion is a quality which has heat and fever and severe pain until the swelling of the fluid subsides; and it is accompanied by corruption that when the fever ceases the pain and the heat cease.</end_of_turn
But a node is not heat or fever or pain, but it contains that thick liquid which is in the belly or sac itself.</end_of_turn
And it is according to the color of the body, and its commencement is like cheese and is found just as well whether large or small, and there are two species, one of which is like fat and contains moisture, and the color of the moisture is various, as I have already said in the division.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you arrive at the care of a node, you must extract that and inquire about the commencement of the pain which is called internal, according to how its form will be in the chapter which is adjacent to this one.</end_of_turn
And this is the method of inquiry for swellings and for all nodes, that you grasp this pain and bring that which is in the cavity which you find in the swelling, and you will remove the strings which you see until you know that the pain has penetrated the skin.
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the size of the swelling, and extract the internal part and consider what remains of it.</end_of_turn
And if the current moisture of whatever color it is, you must prick it on the superficial layer according to what I have said concerning other swellings.</end_of_turn
And if there is no moisture left from the internal part, you will know that it is fat.</end_of_turn
And dry it over it in a cross shape according to this figure:</end_of_turn Ayssi cum t’e ensenhat, e suspen aquel am oncis, e excorja la codena de tota part am facilitat, e guarda la pel o sac, si podes, sobre aquel e extraguas aquela sania am le node.
May be if it is fractured in the operation, it is not possible to extract that callous matter, and many veins have been seen to bleed thereupon, and therefore you must extract it piecemeal until no cause remains.
For if there remains any cause, slight or much, the node returns according to the way
And if sometimes some small part remains, then complete the wound with several corrosive powders and strengthen the wound, and place your hand over that which is to be sutured, and care for the other care until it is healed
And if the node is great, then you must clamp its lips and care for that which is inside.
May be if the pulse is towards the opposite, or is not pulsating, then you must cover and empty the area of the wound with chaff which is old and rough, and apply that thread for two days or three until the wound is healed and the swelling has subsided; and then return to sawing what is left of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of the instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of those, the forms of the intestines are three in number, which are great, middle, and small
The form of the great intestine is as follows:
The form of the small intestine is as follows
They make incisions from iron, from alum, from severed extremities that are placed downward, so that they may rest in the incisions.
And these are the forms of the experts, and they are called barbers, and one of them is called barber.
And there are three kinds, which are great, middle, and small
The form of the great expert is as follows:
The form of the middle expert is as follows
The form of the small expert is as follows
I believe that these are for incisions and exits and fistulas and swellings so that between these there are bones and other causes
And they make round, hooked, lion-like, just as large needles with which the threads are sewn, and they are made of gold, or of silver, or of iron, or of lead. And the threads are when they are made of gold
And they are made by black plum experts, who remember that for these the fistulas are opened in the concavity of which there are reflections, which are reflected back by their elevation from those reflections
And there are three kinds, of which some are long, and others middle, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the stricture of it.
The form of the great expert of plum is as follows
The form of the middle expert of plum is as follows
The form of the small expert of plum is as follows
The forms of nails are of various kinds, which are of two kinds, which is a simple curve, and of three kinds: great, small and middle
And there are blunt nails, and of three kinds
And of these there are nails having two curves, and of three kinds
And of these there are nails having three curves, and of three kinds
And all these are necessary in their place.
The form of a simple small nail is as follows
Form a single ball, having two curves: Form a single orb, form them thus: Form a single ball, having two curves.
Form a single ball, having three curves
Form a single orb, form them thus
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut, and there are three species, of which one is great, one medium, and one small.
Form of great scalpel:
Form of medium scalpel
Form of small scalpel
The extremities of those on which the incision is made are sharp, and the others are not sharp, and they are not to be grasped in such a way, but rather that it should be done gently in order to avoid injuring the veins or nerves, and for those it is healthy to the patient and gives peace that a little be added to the incision which causes the bursting of the abscess.
These are the forms of almagidas, and there are three species: great, medium, and small, just like grapes.
They are useful for ears and resemble a ray on which alcohol is made.
And it is in the extremity where the puncture is made with the sponge hidden and in which runs towards the inner and outer parts, when you wish, just as you see it.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers should perform the perforation of the abscesses and do not perceive the pain, and there are three species: great, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of winds with which the flow of blood is broken, and there are three species; great, medium, and small; the forms of these:
They are useful for ears, round with any length, and are subtle.
And that these three species of winds should be taken because of their great, medium, and small size, so that by these the flow of blood is broken with speed when necessary, and when you first arrive it is not medicine
But do not use them to break the blood in any part of the body, and do not use them in places that are not fleshy, such as in the cavities of the limbs and the buttocks, and in the veins, and in the breasts, and the belly and the groin, and they resemble those of fleshy wounds that are hummed
And many other herbs are useful for those instruments and other small things resembling fish scales according to this form; for which the blood is broken when it is made for phlebotomy, or due to the incision of a vein or artery.
And many herbs are useful round according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Of the care of the breasts of men which are assembled of women.
Some herbs make the breasts of young men swell due to their sleep with them when they begin to become hairy, and in this way they swell the breasts and assemble the breasts of women, and remain abscesses, leaving scars.
And to him who suffers from this, cover that with lunar incision according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and remove the whole hardness, and replace the wound with an ointment of medicinal ointment, and adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and take care of that which is within that it is healed
More so if the breast leans towards the outer parts and is softened by its magnitude just as it is for women, the hour is that it is split into two lateral sections as wide as possible, with two cuts resembling a lunar shape, of which each is contained in the other one because of the end of each one, until the greater line contains the smaller one according to this form of the line of B and the line of G. And in this way remove the cord which is between the two lips of the wound, and keep the swelling, and administer what has been said of the suture and the patches that are necessary for the healing until it is healed
If you do not comply with the incision of that which covers the cause of the patient's discomfort, and for the flow of blood, it is necessary that you hempe the plague of coto submerged in corrosive ointment and leave that which corrodes until that which corrodes is rosin of the grease, and then care for that which remains that is healthy.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
If you do not comply with the incision of that which covers the cause of the patient's discomfort, and for the flow of blood, it is necessary that you hempe the plague of coto submerged in corrosive ointment and leave that which corrodes until that which corrodes is rosin of the grease, and then care for that which remains that is healthy.
When the abscesses of the species of nodes or of the scrophulas are, then you split over that again as we have said in the section about the equal scrophulas.
May the plague be extended in such a way that it will not suffice to reduce it, then administer in it the cautery as we have said above
Capitol .xlviii.
Of the incision of abscesses that happen by cutting or by vein.
When the cutting is ruptured, and the cord is consolidated which is above that, then move the veins away that are adjacent to the abscess. It is known that inflammation and abscess are caused by the artery or vein: for when the abscess is caused by cutting, it is long aggregated in the front of the body; and that when you touch the abscess with the fingers, sitting in the place where there is a stridor.
And that which is caused by the vein is redone at the sign of the body
And the incision about this abscess is wrong, and especially in those that leave the abscesses, and in the armpits, and in the groin, and in many places of the body; and it is not great, therefore it is necessary that its care be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or at the head, must be avoided
May about that which is for the inflammation of the orifice of the cutting, split the cord section in the long; and immediately grasp the section with a clamp and the cutting, and deliver from the tunics until it is uncovered
And immediately put over that needle and make that penetrate into the other side, and open the cutting with faith doubled in two places, — which causes and you will see in the extraction of two veins which are in the temples
And immediately put on the place where are between two ligaments with a sponge so that when the blood is gone away that which is in it, and be dissolved the abscess
And immediately administer care in which is engendered poverty until the ligaments fall; and care that is convenient with ointment until it is healthy
And if the abscess is caused by the cutting of a vein, then you must have in your hand what is at your disposal of the abscess at the cord, and immediately put in the needle that you had your hand from, and make that penetrate; and be in that fold doubled until you extract that from the other side, and immediately ligate the abscess with a good ligament as I have said above in the section of the grape of two parts at two extremities of the fold.
May if you fear that you will extract the fold, then immediately put in the faith with that needle from all the abscess you must leave the incision of the first needle, and strengthen the tissues firmly in four places.
And immediately dry the abscess in the middle of its place until when it is gone away that which is in it, then you will cut the excess of the cord, and leave what is bound.

Capitol l of the abscess which happens for the twist of nerves
In just the same way as it happens with an abscess caused by cutting or by a vein, and in the same way as it happens with an abscess caused by their percussion or by excessive work, and for some other reasons.
It is customary for them to make points on the toes or ankles, or in any place where they suspect there is inflammation of the joints.
It is a serious ailment, appearing like the color of the rest of the body, and is most common among those who have a lot of wealth, and when it is severe, it causes the patient to appear stunned
It is not a superficial ailment, but rather one that penetrates the very depths of the body, so leave the bandage alone, and do not touch anything further.
Therefore, when it comes to the joints, it is not enough just to apply pressure with iron, for a strong contraction must accompany it
More than that, if it is on the head or the front of the face apply the bandage with force.</start_of_turn> More than if it is a slight ailment, in that case you must force them and cut away that which is unnecessary.</start_of_turn>
And if it is great, then you must suspend it with a bandage, and wash it away, and then hold it in place; and suture the wound so that it heals properly.</start_of_turn

Section on the treatment of gout, which occurs when cold humors infiltrate the body and cause swelling in the joints.
Therefore, all those who are afflicted with this disease in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies are called fungal because of their resemblance to fungi; for the root of the disease is subtle, and the head of the disease is large; and their lips are dry, and it is of those who are small, and is of those who are not magnificent.</start_of_turn>
I have already seen one case where two of these patients in the belly resembled fungi in every way, and there was no difference between the white ones and the dark ones, those with little root.</start_of_turn
And their lips were dry and cracked, and sweat ran from their bodies all the time.</start_of_turn
Therefore I conclude that these people have gout and I anoint their feet accordingly.</start_of_turn and the other one has it in the ankles.</start_of_turn
And the treatment for the disease is to consider if the patient is sweating, and if the color of the ailment is white, humous, of subtle root; then you must make a burn with a spatula at the foot of the sufferer, because the matter that must be expelled must be expelled without leaving a residue; and if it escapes you, burn it.
And if sometimes the patient is pale and fearful, do not make the incision with iron; but rather wait for a recent bruise to form, and press firmly on that ailment; this is the way we have learned; and let it last for two days.</start_of_turn
And so tighten the ligature of the bruise; therefore, do not stop pressing the bruise greatly until it is separated and falls off by itself.</start_of_turn
More than if it is of great root, the disease is a cause of fear and terror, especially in the belly.</start_of_turn
It is possible that you will have to make an incision of great extent, and then burn that to prevent it from returning.</start_of_turn
And so care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And remember that you should not presume to make an incision of that which is of dark color, of little sensation, of little regard, for that which is abscess is pus.</start_of_turn
And I remember that I have seen this many times before.</start_of_turn

On the treatment of great importance concerning the navel.</start_of_turn
The navel is useful for many causes; or for tears of the pericardium which is over the belly, and these are covered with the tissue or the bubble according as it happens in other ruptures; or for healing which flows from veins or arteries as it is said above, or for congestion caused by excessive wind.</start_of_turn
More than if for a tear of the pericardium and for swelling of the tissue, the color of the ailment is similar to the color of the body; and it is like a lion in its pain, and appears in various positions.</start_of_turn And if it is for the discharge of the bubble, the situation of that which we have recounted is of more diverse situations; and as you have already said concerning the things which we have hidden, return it; and it is of great force in it, and is magnificent without causing any damage to the intestines or excessive work.</start_of_turn
May it be known that when humidity increases, it is not hidden when I press my hand onto your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it painful.
And if it is for safety, when I touch your skin, I do not cause swelling or discoloration to appear.</end_of_turn>
May it be known that if it is for flesh, the pain is great, bulky and hard, and persists according to its quantity.</end_of_turn>
May it be known that if it is for wind, the pain touches you like a lion.</end_of_turn
And the operation in this case is that you must consider the pain if the prominence of the navel is for the safety of the intestines, or of the veins, or for the wind; for in this case you must abstain from the care of the limb, for in this case there is fear and pain just as I have taught you in the chapter where I said about the swelling of the intestines and veins.</end_of_turn>
And if the prominence of the navel is for the intestine or for the skin, the physician must command the patient to lie still and extend; and I order you to touch the circumference of the navel with your hand, and order him to stay between your thighs, and I order you to encircle the circumference of the navel around the area where you have touched; and I order you to stretch the greater part of the swelling towards the lower parts of the body with one hand; and I order you to support the circumference with a firm or soft hand and with good handling.</end_of_turn
And I order you to uncover the tip of the swelling that is extended over the ligament and insert your finger into that place and grasp the intestine; and if you have grasped it neither held for the ligament, the pain will come out and push the intestine outwards of the belly.</end_of_turn
And if you have grasped the skin, the pain will take hold of you once; and burn the superfluous parts of it.</end_of_turn
May it be known that if it is contrary to your intestines or veins, the pain will surround this movement, and I order you to return to your operation; and take two needles and put them in those two strong fields and enter two needles into the circumference which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which shall penetrate; and I order you to strengthen the swelling in four parts over the needles.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, leave the needles and lie down until the fleshy extension falls down by itself; or burn that when it is subtle and it falls down, and I order you to care for that which covers the intestines until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the prominence of the navel is for flesh in it or for humidity, the physician must command the swelling to be reduced just as we have said and extract the safety or the humidity, which you find in it, and I order you to care for that which covers and consolidates the area.</end_of_turn

Of the care of inflammation.</end_turn>
We have already said, in the division, about the species of inflammation and how it is proper to care for it with medicines, and that it is dangerous to care for it with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said that inflammation is engendered in the marrow and must be treated with caution.</end_of_turn
And the ancients say that some inflammations of the joint are in places where it is impossible to eradicate them, just as in the breasts or in the groin and in the vicinity of the limbs that are allocated to expel all that, and more so when it begins small.</end_of_turn
May it be known that when it is ancient and is grave, do not attempt to touch it, for I have never seen that it can be healed by any means, neither by medicine nor by any other, nor by anything that has reached me.</end_of_turn
And the operation in this case is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede and leave the patient and purge of black bile some herbs, and I order you to care for that, if it is found to be useful in replacing the visible symptoms.</end_of_turn
And I order you to prepare the patient with the preparation in which he is located in the operation, and I order you to place on the wound a bandage which covers the area; and I order you to evacuate all the bowels from the belly until no remains any cause of the cause of the inflammation.</end_of_turn And lie down the safety, and do not burn it hastily, and press the areas, and wipe away the safety with your hand or with the instrument which is convenient to you.</end_of_turn
May it be known that if you do contrary to safety by burning the veins or the intestines, the pain will cauterize that until the flow of safety is stopped, and I order you to care for that which remains of the other care until it is healed.</end_of_turn

We have already recounted, in the division, of the species of dropsy of the water, and their signs, as well as the treatment of them with medicines.
And that which is cured by iron is nothing but the species of althites alone, and is not approached by iron to the species of tympanists or to the species of hippocresses, which is mortal
And when you have medicated this species of dropsy of tympanists with medicines and do not confirm your medicine, then consider that if the patient has already achieved debility due to this, or is suffering from another disease, then indeed in him or in his belly and around these things, you must keep in mind that you should not give him iron, for fear of that
May be sometimes the patient has excessive vomiting, and it is not another disease but only simple dropsy, neither young nor old, then the manner of the operation of it is that you raise his belly up between your thighs, and hold his abdomen with your hand, fill the water to the part beyond the navel, and take sponges according to this method:
either of two sharp tongues long, or of sharp extremity thus as sponges; however, let it be little by little in each, so that in the operation there does not pass into the belly, and that you see that.
And consider also if the generation of dropsy is from the bowels, because in that case you must remove the navel from the belly for the quantity of three fingers beyond the navel.
However, if the generation of dropsy is from kidney disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel for three fingers.
And if the generation is from the spleen, then your incision should be at the flanks
And do not let your incision be over the rib where the patient is vomiting, so as not to cause the fluids to run to that place
And pierce with the instruments all the corden, and enter into that incision, and raise your hand with the sponge between the corden and the intestines, and drain that; and if there is the quantity of a nail or two.
And pierce the sac until the sponge reaches the place where the water is And extract that and insert an instrument of this shape which is like a silver cannula; it is made of silver or lead or gold, and in the lower part of it is a small hole, and on the sides of it are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its use is to pierce according to the manner of a pen, as sometimes:
And in the extremity of it is an arm, because when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately releases so much water that if you evacuate more than this in an hour, it will cause great harm to the patient for the resolution of the spirit animal, or injuries to the five senses which is close to death
However, evacuate according to the quantity of the vomit and according to what you understand from the patient’s disposition of the vomit and of the state of his body.
And extract the instrument, and retain the water which is the cause of this, because it is retained by the corden which retains the hole that is over the sac from which we have recommended that you pierce according to that manner.
And repeat the instrument another day if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days in fear, and take care that there remains no water except a little.
However, if you are afraid of the patient, and you see a great quantity of water, then cure that which you must bury in fine sand, and bathe his wound in bath, and expose to the sun for a long time; and cure that which you must give drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize over the stomach, and the spleen and the kidney at the time of the extraction of the water, as I have recounted above in what precedes.

Of the treatment of children who are born with unperfected urinary tract locations.
Some of the children are like this from the womb of their mother and the head of their bladder is not perforated (or is very narrow or is not in its place).
Therefore cover the area around the perforation as much as possible so that it is born without significant spurting according to this method.
And immediately suspend the bleeding with a plum stone weight and tie it, and keep it for three days or for four
And when you have finished urinating, remain for a while and urinate again; and then return it
And if you do not suspend the bleeding, it is possible that the urine that flows over the area will not collect in this bladder
More severe than this, that from which the bleeding originates is treated with a plum weight, as we have already said, for three days before it is aggravated
More severe still are those in which the bleeding does not originate in the bladder, that is to say, the cause is that of those, the one that is natural is that the bleeding arises from the end of the bladder so that it cannot urinate downwards; until you elevate the bladder with your hand to the upper parts; and this is not its normal condition, for in this case the sperm is unable to reach its height according to the rule, and this is a bad disease of the bladder.
The manner of performing the operation in this case is that the patient is placed face down on the two hips, and you extend the head of the bladder with your left hand with violent extraction, and you pierce the head of the bladder at the location of the periosteum with a sharp instrument, as if it were pierced with a needle, or that you do not tear away any part, for so the semen remains like the head of the bladder and the bleeding falls into the proper place as we have covered.</start_of_turn>
And remember that in the performance of this operation of bleeding, that many times accidents happen; and suspend the operation when you have closed the bladder, and care for the wound until it has healed.</start_of_turn>

Concerning the abortion that occurs in the prepuce at the head of the bladder and the corruption, necrosis and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the bladder.</start_of_turn
Many times these accidents happen in the bladder and are an eminent cause of lameness.</start_of_turn
And from these two there is one that is malignant and one that is not malignant.</start_of_turn
Not malignant, for in this case you suspend with a single weight and close that when it is whole; and immediately suspend over that cavity submerged in Egyptian unguent; and do so until that is also healed.</start_of_turn
And if the abortion is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer pointed cautery nearby the incision and in the ratio of the lesion.</start_of_turn
More severe still, if the abortion is in the prepuce at the head of the bladder and is not circumcised, and one part of the abortion is downwards the prepuce and the other part is outwards, then you must know that you must leave the abortion that is downwards until it is consolidated; and you must care for the one that is outwards, for when you have cared for that, even though you have cared for the downwards one, you are not certain that it has not been fractured.</start_of_turn
And these days there are accidents in the genitals and in the prepuce of necrosis, corruption and blackening, where you must know that you must remove everything that is already blackened and that is about to become corrupted or that is already corrupted; and immediately suspend over that area with the aforementioned salve, which is composed of a mixture of millet flour and burnt hair, and barley flour and blood of nightshade.</start_of_turn
And care for the other until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if there is bleeding of the bladder, then you must administer lunar cautery as follows:
because the lunar cautery has two positions together, that is, bleeding of the bladder and the corruption of the wound when it is corrupted.</start_of_turn>
And if the head of the bladder is corroded and is destroyed in an hour, then you must insert into the body of the prepuce a a plum catheter so that the patient can urinate through that.</start_of_turn
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the bladder (and this adhesion does not happen except in the case of the one in which the prepuce is soft, and over that it is not required to perform circumcision; and when it happens by wound or by abscess) you must scrape with a blunt object until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the bladder is freed throughout.)
And if it is difficult to remove them completely, you must scrape with a blunt object over the head of the bladder and the prepuce, and help so that when the prepuce is soft, it is easily perforated by its softness.)
And so separate between the prepuce and the head of the penis, the one which is already swollen in the cold water because it does not adhere to any other hair.
And do so with a cautery until it is solidified
Chapter 77
Concerning the care of children and the treatment of those who have undergone circumcision
Circumcision is not a solution to all ailments, just as other diseases: more importantly, however, in children, since it is done of our own free will and for their own good, it is necessary that we assign in this operation a greater care and less suffering for the child.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in their laws, because they did not use it, and it is only because we have learned through experience that the greatest part of physicians and barbers use circumcision for the novice and the barbarous; and they do so with thread and with an incision at the nail
And I myself have tried all these methods and I do not believe that there is a better circumcision than with forceps, with thread and with a faithful grasp of the nail, because with these methods the codena escapes more easily, because the cord of the prepuce is doubled, and the tension remains better, and it is less painful And in digital circumcision which is useful for alphbetization, and which is practiced by the barbers, the incision of the extremity of the member is not followed, for it is strong enough to enter through the opening of the member
More in the operation with the nail, attention must be paid to iron and corrupt your operation And the cord of the child is short by nature, and often it is not necessary to perform circumcision in this way, and I have seen cases where this has been the case
More of the circumcision done with forceps and thread and faithful, the better, experiment has shown me that the forceps are in proportion to the incision, because the pain that results from the former is as great as the pain that is left; and therefore when you place your hand in proportion to these two pains, you make an incision according to a comparison in a time; and it is useful to compress the thread with a figure containing the entire cord of the penis, to which there is no error of any kind.
The first method is that you must keep the child still if he is young, and if he is old you must only lie the thread in his penis alone, and you must read him to sleep within the other day.
And so do that with all your ability so that he may receive his intelligence And so do that with your hands placed calmly prepared, and do not be stupid; and hide the forceps in your hand or put them in his foot, so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
And so put your hand on the penis and blow on the cord, and pull that until the head of the penis is withdrawn, and then perform that which is added to it from the moisture.
The form of the forceps for circumcision is as follows:
The one that is not curved at the tail and the other is curved, that it does not reach the root of the claw, and that the length of the two points is as great as the length of two fingernails together
More an error in circumcision is that it causes the excision of the entire intrinsic cord or part of it from the incision
Therefore take your time with your hand and with your nail before the apostemaction of the area and make the incision according to equality
And if you cannot take it with your nail, take it with your thumb and make the incision there
More if three days have passed, and the swelling of the penis has subsided, then you must read to him when it is convenient to make the incision, and remove the clot with ease, and make the incision as you are prepared
Keep your head still, for it will not help you.
Therefore take care of that which is at the root of the disease that has been recommended in the treatise on humors.</end_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make an incision according to measure, and you obey the orders, then it will not cause them any harm.</end_of_turn
And take care of that which we have said is necessary for their recovery.</end_of_turn

Of the care of retained urine in the bladder.</end_of_turn
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by excessive fullness due to stones or sand, or by poverty or carbuncles, and it is similar to what we have said concerning the methods of treatment in the division.</end_of_turn
And if it is not dissolved as we have said, and it appears that this is the cause of the disease, then you must administer the extraction with an instrument called a siringua, which is like this: made of silver or bronze, with a needle like a barleycorn about half as long, to which is attached a tube of about the same length.
And the manner of extracting the urine from the patient is that you take the loop of the tube and bind it at the exit of the bladder with good ligature; then you introduce the loop of the tube into the cavity through the opening of the bladder, and remove any excess by means of forceps, but do not insert the needle too deeply. And then tighten the bladder around the tube and around the hub of the needle.</end_of_turn
And do the patient sit on the edge of the bed, and bandage the bladder and the groin with oil and wool, and olive oil and vinegar.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw the needle slowly so that it does not cause any pain; then bend the bladder downwards towards the navel; then grasp the tube with your thumb and index finger; and finally grasp the bladder itself with your other hand. When the needle has passed through all these layers, the patient will feel relief from the pain, and this is not in vain according to this order, but in the place where there was previously pain, there will be no more.</end_of_turn
And slowly pull out the tube with the urine, so that the urine does not irritate the bladder.</end_of_turn
Thus extract and care for the urine, and use a siringua, do not cease to do so until the bladder is empty and the patient experiences relief from the pain.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 59.</end_of_turn
Of the qualities of the clamp and instruments for bladder irrigation that are suitable for this purpose.</end_of_turn
When there is an ulcer or swelling in the bladder, or sand, or if the bladder is narrowed by a stone, and you wish to instill water and medicines, then it is necessary to use a clamp to hold the opening of the bladder. This is how it is made:
So if the bladder neck is deaf, it is closed.</end_of_turn And there are three parts to it: two from one side, thus as many times.</end_of_turn
In the beginning is the loop with the liquid which is to be instilled, and as much as it covers that, so much more is added, until when any cause is overcome by this, that is to say, when it is expelled, it is expelled along with the liquid, and when it is expelled long, as the clamp holds that which is in the bowels of the sea.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you wish to instill liquid in the bladder, insert the clamp into the liquid and draw out that liquid which is in the bladder, because the liquid is expelled from the cavity of the clamp.</end_of_turn
And then insert the clamp into the neck of the bladder according to what has been said concerning the siringua; and grasp the liquid with the clamp, because that liquid will reach the bladder in this way, and the patient will experience relief from the pain in this way.</end_of_turn
The bladder is crystallized in the shape of a prism.
Whether it is caused by silver or lead, of which the head has more, or resembling a small pen, leave it as it is, bound by ligament.</end_of_turn>
Then take the bladder steadily, and suspend the humidity you wish to crystallize in the bladder, and then bind that between two strong ligatures, and heat that humidity over the fire.</end_of_turn>
Then pull out the extremity of the prism into the groove.</end_of_turn
And then open your hand over the bladder with the humidity that has been stretched out so that the patient does not feel that humidity has already reached the bladder.</end_of_turn>
If there is no bladder present, then take a piece of sponge and make a circle of it; pierce that through its entire circumference; and then insert a strong thread firmly through those holes, even if they are revolting; and then join the circle again as it is joined to the sponge, because you rest in that water which you take from the humors, and oil and water.</end_of_turn
And then bind that in the instrument as you did with the bladder, and express it with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.</end_of_turn
The treatise ends here.</end_of_turn>
From the extraction of the stone.</end_of_turn>
We have already said in the division the species of stones and their care with medicines, and the difference between a stone engendered in the humors and a stone engendered in the bladder, and we will remind you of that.</end_of_turn
And we have said the stone in which catz operation is made with the hand, and section.</end_of_turn
And the stone engendered in the bladder itself is that which is left in the bladder.</end_of_turn
And thus we have narrated that which is the exhibition and abreviation.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the stone which is engendered in the greater bladder mostly appears in childhood; and concerning its signs, that the urine which is excreted from the bladder is similar to water in its transparency, and appears in that sand; and the patient often has frequent pain in his groin, and swelling in the legs, and is dressed; and in that water there is found in the stool of those.</end_of_turn
And it is laughable the healing of the children of that until they have reached thirteen years; and it is difficult to cure them in the old.</end_of_turn More easily in the young than in the old.</end_of_turn
And of that of which the stone is greater and the care is lighter; and if it is little, it is contrary to that.</end_of_turn
Therefore when we come to the cure of that, we must begin by making modification to the patient's pain by extracting all the pus that is in the abscesses that are in the groin; for that abscess with many swellings hinders the infection of the stone due to the inquiry of these.</end_of_turn
And thus be present the patient with the groin pain and sit with knees bent and feet up so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or that some swellings may jump from place.</end_of_turn
And thus do that which is between your thighs prepared, and the greater part of them leave the cushions of their thighs, so that the entire bladder is made to lean downwards towards the parts behind.</end_of_turn
And thus require that and all that surrounds it.</end_of_turn
Therefore if you feel the stone in the space, the hour you cover it so much with incision over it.</end_of_turn
And if you do not feel it all, leave it touched slightly, and put oil on it as an indication of the left hand, if the patient is a child, or say half if it is a complete youth, and insert that into the groin.</end_of_turn And require of the stone until it is left touching it.</end_of_turn And convert that little by little into the belly of the bladder.</end_of_turn
And thus place your hand over that which you touch, and expel that to the outside beyond the location from which you made the incision.</end_of_turn
Command the minister to hold the bladder with his hand; and command another minister with his right hand to extend the buttocks to the outside, and with his left hand to compress the cord which is left by the buttocks, in the part of the place where the incision is made.</end_of_turn
And immediately insert the spatula, since this is its shape: And immediately insert the spatula, since this is its shape. Split it between the hip and the knee, not in the middle of the limb, towards the outer side of the left thigh; and make the incision over the heel of the foot and the heel itself. Make a transverse incision, so that the outer incision is wide and the inner incision is narrow according to the quantity of pus that comes out of the foot, and do not make it larger, for that would compress the heel that is in the buttock.
And know that from the foot there is some angle and margin, for that its essence is difficult to grasp by that.
And from that pus there is something like slime, which is round, and it is the cause of its lightness.
Therefore if it is that from which there are angles and margins, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus forced, then you must hold that limb above that, or strengthen it above that limb conveniently, the limb which is like that to the limb which you strengthen over the foot, and do not neglect it; or that you insert your instruments under the curved limb.
Or if you cannot do that, then expand the wound a little, and if you see discharge of pus, cut off the violent vomiting.
Or if the foot is larger than one, then immediately put your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and immediately insert the spatula over it; and immediately push out a little of the pus; and do the same if there are clots of pus larger than two
Or if the foot is large, it is known that by making a great incision, two things happen to the patient: either that it is left there or that it causes the continuous dripping of urine, for which reason the limb is not completely consolidated
Or administer the evacuation of the pus that is outside, or engineer the fracture of the limb with forceps until you extract that in pieces.
Therefore when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood, and strengthen that. And rest upon that limb immersed in oil and vinegar, or in scented oil and warm water, so that the cautery will be softened
And keep the patient lying down on the side, and do not remove the dressing until the third day.
And when that has gone, bathe the limb with water and oil, and care for that limb with ointment and diazepam until it is healed
Or if there is pus in the wound after the cautery, adhere and dissolve it, for if there is urine in the bladder (and that is known as the evacuation of the bladder), then immediately remove the heel of the foot from the wound and extract that pus, for if it remains it will cause the corruption of the bladder and its decay.
And finally wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and against all spices, with oil that will facilitate its healing.
And keep throughout the treatment that you lie both thighs together and adjust the medicines that are placed on the limb.
And if the foot is small and is in the heel of the foot, and is fixed there, and the evacuation of urine is prohibited, then it is known that the treatment must be prolonged, for this treatment is accused of cutting; and already I have mentioned that, and it is that you take a needle of iron to perforate it, of which this is the shape.
Triangular, extended, acute, fixed in flesh.</start_of_turn>
And immediately take hold, and keep that limb so that the foot does not return to the bladder.</start_of_turn>
And immediately insert the needle into the heel, perforating easily until the needle comes out at that foot And rotate the needle in your hand over that small foot, and you will perforate the wound until you have passed that of the other part to penetrate; for the urine will be discharged completely.</start_of_turn>
And immediately put your hand over that which is remaining of the foot of the heel, which is tornated, and is forced by the urine, and the patient is healed.</start_of_turn>
Or if this treatment does not please you for any cause that hinders you, then immediately tie a thread around the foot and another thread untie the foot.</start_of_turn E aprop encideys sobre la peyra en aquela vergua entre doas liaduras. Then extract that. Then remove the ligament and restore the limb with ointment, which is useful in the plague
And do not ligate the vein, but only that it does not return to the bladder, and the other ligate only when it is detached, because when it is detached the vein immediately resumes its course and causes the plague.
And for this reason when you have detached the vein, elevate the limb above the level of the bladder, or that it returns backwards through the belly, and cause the plague as we have said.

From the extraction of stones from the thighs.
Stones in the thighs are rarely engendered
If however one sees stones in any of these, it is difficult to cure them, and it is prohibited by experienced physicians.
One of them is that the strong thigh is pregnant.
The other is that you do not find the stone unless it is expelled by the patient when it is cast out by the physician, or is from women who have had intercourse
The third is that you do not find the stone unless you are taught this art, especially the operation with the hand
The fourth is that the place of the incision concerning the stone in the thighs is far from the place of the stone, because it indicates danger of incision, and in that there is fear
If however necessity compels you to do so, take a large stone that is well known, and little is found.
If you have none of these, take a large stone that is almost white, or present a matron woman who has been proven in the art, or a woman who in this art has given birth easily
So present her and command her to do everything that you order her, from the inquiry concerning the stone from the beginning; for the reason is to learn if the woman is pregnant, for the hour that she puts all this aside and wants the stone
If you find it, cover that with what you have said, and command her to mark upon that place
If she is not a virgin, command the matron to insert what you have said into the belly of the patient and take hold of the stone, because she places her left hand over the bladder, and confirm that there.
So if you find it, gradually pull that out from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts until you reach that which is at the root of the cause
And immediately mark upon that spot where the cause has been stopped and center the stone in that place, so that the hand does not remain near the stone any more.
The incision should be slight at the beginning; and immediately insert the instrument over that incision, and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to the quantity that you know the stone will be expelled by that.
You know that the species of stones are many: some are few and large, some are like lion's stones and rough, some are long and round, and some have ramps.
Therefore you must know what species they are that you are signifying about what you wish
And if you see a flow of blood, adjust the soaked cloth tightly and hold it for an hour until the bleeding has ceased, and then return to your operation until the stone is expelled
And make ready all your instruments which are said in the extraction of stones from the thighs, so that you may be helped in your operation by these people.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of the blood comes from the artery that is pierced, then you must stop the powder over the place and open that part more widely, and do not do anything further; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for that will cause the patient to die Take care of the plague.
When the acute pain of the blood has subsided a little after a few days, and the limb has become soft, then you return to your operation until the stone is expelled

And now take two cloths and fill them with wet lancets according to this pattern; and make points on the parts where coto or lancets are put, and add them to the structure in the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities before the heel enters the two, and the other before the heel of the knee, and two extremities over two toes and two extremities on two ankles, and adjust all the structures in the groin of the thighs.
And thus this hernia is treated artificially with a pointed cautery in place of an incision with a knife; and take a pointed cautery and insert it into the codena of the genitals, and ignite it as we have recommended until the white sac containing the urine is discovered, and then take the cautery in this way: and make a Greek cross.
And then pierce that sac, and ignite until all the moisture is driven out
And then stretch the sac with forceps, and scour with forceps, and scour with the pointed cautery ignited; and insert that as you are able until you have evacuated all of it; and keep away from the fire that the flame does not touch you.
And know that this operation is more safe and more lengthy than an incision with a knife, and better than an operation with a section
More than if in the act of incision or in the act of cautery, or flux of oil, know that you must take care of whatever discomfort arises to you in this matter, with the care that you are accustomed to give to them as it is said.
More than if the patient is poor, and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, know that you must perform the perforation as I have recommended above; and that is when it is confirmed that indeed this hernia is harmless.
Know that you must place the patient upon any elevated surface, and perforate the apostema in the lower part of the limb at the side of the palm of the hand, and stop the perforation according to the length of the limb.
And let the incision be wide enough to drain out all the urine
And then place over the place the coto and tie that and leave that, so that the urine remains there And take care that the wound is healed
More than if there is resistance to the flow of urine at that moment you perforate that: and that is not useful except for the fact that the white puss in the orifice of the wound makes resistance to the flow of urine, while you must prevent the flow of urine from coming out; in this case you must extract the urine from the bladder in some way; or you must adjust in the oppression of the wound a small instrument with which the urine is extracted from the bladder, the form of which is preceded.
And know that the urine returns, and is increased about six months or in the springtime; and when it is increased, the perforation must be repeated according to that manner, for the patient will pass the stone in those days.

Of the incision concerning carnosa hernia and the care of them
Know that in the incision concerning this hernia there is fear of permanent damage in the greatest facilities; for I have seen the diminution of them and their being saved in that manner
And I remember the operation in which and the species of the apostemas
Therefore, I say that the apostemas arise in the thighs of which the genetius are composed and is useful for many causes: or for an acute inflammation that is spread to the genetius, or for percussion
The color of the apostema is according to the color of the limb, and is not found in pain, and is a difficult apostema
And the soft apostema, of which the color is dark, is not centiment to it
And sometimes it is useful for the nodulation of the arteries, and for inflammation of those as well as when the memory of them has already been perceived, or for inflammation of veins
The swelling of the joints is known as gout when it is caused by the discharge of purulent matter from the bladder when it is pressed in the abdomen. It does not matter if that touch is applied.
The swelling of the veins is not dispersed by any cause by the compression of those that are said.</end_of_turn>
And it is possible that in this case the cutting will be sufficient, and concerning the other parts; and that you insert the codena of the genetia, and then stretch out the blood vessels under the skin, extract that from the white pith, discharge the lymph from the vessels, and ligate them, and insert more lymph than you discharge from the whole of the blood vessels.</end_of_turn>
Therefore if the blood has already solidified in those parts, then you must extract it and insert it.</end_of_turn
And if there is adherence from any cause between the bones, or between the vessels, then you must discharge all that adherence and insert it by incision around.</end_of_turn
And if there is birth from flesh in the place of the adherence that is behind, then you must insert all that is of it, and extract the blood as we have said.</end_of_turn
Therefore when your operation is finished, then fill the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and vinegar; and take care of the other care until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

The purulent matter is enveloped by any covering similar to a sprout with mollification of the testicles, and it is difficult for the patient to exercise and walk on the affected side.</end_of_turn
And in the care of this disease is to be careful of what precedes the recollection.</end_of_turn
However we must say the operation in the second place.</end_of_turn
And I say that you must raise the patient onto a high cushion; and then stretch out the lymph vessels of the testicles to the lower parts; and then insert the codena of the genetia into the abdomen with the veins that are to be opened; and hold those other attendants who you have, and extend those with violent extension.</end_of_turn
And insert with a sharp knife across the edge of the vessels until the vessels are revealed.</end_of_turn
And extract from the whole of the body as we have said in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
And leave in those a needle that is firm and double, and ligate that at the first place where the wound happened, and ligate the other vein at the end of them.</end_of_turn And insert again in the middle of the body for a transverse incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors.</end_of_turn
And take care of the wound with the care of the other wounds in which you wish to generate that the veins which accompany one of the two testicles, which is not bad for what.
However if the veins have all happened, then you must extract the testicles or that the testicles because of the veins, because it is private of all nourishment for the incision of the veins, and that they are established, or that they are equal so that they are not harmful to those.</end_of_turn

Of the care of intestinal hernias.</end_of_turn
The occurrence of this hernia is by incision that extends over the abdomen from the flanks of the navel to the navel, so that the intestines of that rupture are included among the intestines.</end_of_turn
And this rupture is either of the pericardium or of excess of it, and it happens for various causes: or for percussion, or for vomiting, or for crying, or for elevation of any serious cause, or for some other reason.</end_of_turn
And the sign of this, when it is for extension of the pericardium, is that it happens little by little over a long time, and does not happen suddenly, and is purulent engalls inside the belly so that the pericardium compresses the intestine.</end_of_turn
And the sign of this is when it is for incision of the pericardium, that at the beginning it causes violent pain suddenly; and it is purulent different from the apparent one because of the proximity of the wound to the apparent one, and that is because of the swelling of the intestine, and the body of the hernia to the parts surrounding the pericardium.</end_of_turn
Every wound that is outside the belly is forgotten at the hernia of the intestines, and is called such an intestinal hernia.
Every wound is caused by the wind, and some wounds enter the belly through a wound, and here it is retained, and it is great pain for the patient, and some wounds cause great pain that is greater when it is disturbed
And in the care of this disease there is fear, for that it covers that it should be avoided in this place.
And the way of performing this operation is that you command the patient to reduce the belly with his hand to the parts around the circumference if he obeys your return order, and then you must be covered over the heel between your thighs, and elevate the legs of the patient.
And then stretch the tendon which joins the testicles to the parts below, and cut the tendon of the testicles throughout; and then fix in two places the edges of the incision according to what you must do to open the incision with these things.</start_turn>
And if the incision is done as much as you can, that from that one will be forgotten.
And then remove the blood clots which are left from the tendon of the testicles, until the white hard substance of some part is discovered.</start_turn
Then you will enter the gut called in that which is between the testicles, in which is between the white substances, which is left from the tendon of the blood, and between the substances that are following, and remove whatever adhesion is in the part behind the blood.</start_turn
And then put your hand on the tendon of the testicles to the parts outside, and with your left hand stretch the white substance outwards, and elevate the blood to the part of the incision; and command the minister to stretch the blood outwards and you will dissolve the adhesion that is behind with the solution accomplished.</start_turn
And seek in the guts that there is no cause for the belly covered in the white hard substance.</start_turn May it be that you find in them some cause, however, you will leave it inside the belly.</start_turn
And then pierce behind the tendon of the testicles for the incision from which blood runs freely and safely as we have recommended that we have said.</start_turn
And then administer lard submerged in oil, and cover in the wound; and administer the thread that we have recommended (for some wounds the white substance of the blood is cauterized, which we have said above to be the fear of the flow of blood, for many wounds happen that these things happen).
And if the case is delayed, the cold water should be covered, and cover on that until it falls as we have said.</start_turn
And take care of the wound with the other care of wounds until it is healed.</start_turn

Some veins become broken in the joints as we have said before, and we must examine the area
And do not cause any injury to the veins of the geneius; and if you must, that is little; and return it quickly in all its entirety
May be if it is prolonged for a long time at this point, an incision must be made in the abdomen until the intestine returns to its cavity; and this is done because the abdomen is extended because of the pain in the joints as we have said before, which causes the abdomen to be distended, and we must soften the area and place our hand over it to prevent the intestine from coming out
And the treatment of them is like this, as soon as the story of them is finished
And every vein is cured like this: and that the patient sits on the seat of two between your hands, and then dry the area of the break of the apostemas we have mentioned before with a piece of cloth of the width of three fingers.
And then strengthen the white abdomen that is under the navel until it is revealed.
And then take the ray and place it over the prominent area of the abdomen, and press that to the navel
And then compress the two prominent areas on the extremity of the ray of the abdomen, and tie one to the other with a suture.
And then extract the extremity of the ray, and do not injure the intestines of any kind, neither extend the blood, nor any other cause as I will tell you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then care for that like the treatment of wounds, and when incisions are made, soften that and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the abdomen is contracted and the prominence of the break is not adjusted
And sitting is better in this place, for it is more likely to be healthy
Capital . lxviii.
Of the softening of the navel of the testicles.
Many veins the navel of the testicles in the cold season is softened to help soften the flesh that is between those and is feared for that reason
When it is necessary to do so in the treatment of these it makes the patient sit on the seat of two, and cut all the navel which is softened over the natural navel; and then tie two lips together with a suture
And if you want, you can also ligate the excess of the softened navel with three or four stitches and a firm suture
And then make incisions between the sutures; and then care for the other wounds until they are healed and the wounds fall off

Of castration
Wise men say that castration is forbidden in our law, however, I remember it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two reasons, of which one is that the physician should know how to cure it when he is asked about it, since he knows how to cure it; and the other reason is that we often have need to castrate other beasts for our youth, for those such as dogs, and sows, and pigs, and the like.
And therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: either by traction or by incision.
May be in that in which it is useful by traction, the way of the operation is that we must cut off the beast in cold water until the testicles are softened and limp and hanging down And then take hold of them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to touch each other
May be in castration useful by incision and section, cover that you have the beast and grasp the navel of the testicles of it with your left hand
And then ligate the surgeon, and make an incision over every vein with a section so that two veins protrude.
And then make incisions of those which are more likely to be excoriated And do not neglect any cause of the abdomen of any kind, but only the abdominal fat which is over the veins
And this method of castration is better than that which is for attrition, because attrition strongly preserves any cause of the testicles, since the beast desires to mate.
And take care of the plague until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Hermaphroditism in men is according to two methods: one is when or appears that the space between the testicles is cut in two in the space between two testicles there appears what looks like a woman in which there are seeds.</end_of_turn
And there are many who urinate from that which is in the space of the testicles.</end_of_turn
More is a kind in women: and it is that the thumb of the hand is like two testicles of a man a little wide and narrow at the root like two testicles of a man.</end_of_turn
And the care is of three kinds: two of the men and one of the women.</end_of_turn And that you keep those parts pressed until the mark of that is gone, and that you take care of those with care for other diseases.</end_of_turn

Strong languor is adjusted on natural causes until it is tormented and is good to look at it regularly; and there are many who are magnified in many women as much as in men and even when they are together.</end_of_turn
Therefore keep the excess of languor with your hand or with one hand and press it.</end_of_turn
And do not stop, mainly in the armpit, so that there is no leakage of urine.</end_of_turn
And take care of that which is cared for the diseases until it is healed.</end_of_turn
More fat is born fat that does not exist in the horror of the mother until it fills that one, and strong fat is ejected from the roots according to the manner of the dog (and for that reason they call it the first disease). Therefore keep it so that we scratch it just as we scratch the languor, and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the care of the wound.</end_of_turn
A wound is that which does not pierce the skin, or that has a small hole.</end_of_turn It is either natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
Accidental is by a disease that has preceded it, or that is caused by fat or by an external or internal wound.</end_of_turn
It is found on the mother's belly, or on the sides, or on the white of the eye, or on the black of the eye, and it forbids scratching and bruising and coitus, and strong fat forbids menstruation.</end_of_turn
And the recognition of that is good for the belly of the womb, if the swelling is apparent, it is enough; more if it is not apparent, then you seek that which is in the belly or in the side.</end_of_turn
More if the swelling is for an external wound, and is sufficient for two lips, then you can scratch and break that.</end_of_turn
And that you rest over two lips the powder, and that you put your hand on the belly indicates that there is something more serious.</end_of_turn
And the woman is over the hips two, the thighs stretched out, and then stretch out the two lips with force until that external wound is broken and the swelling is opened.</end_of_turn
And take some wool and soak it in oil and put it on the area, and hold it with the hand of the man so that the wound does not solidify.</end_of_turn
More if the wound is thick and bloody, then keep that which is around the wound wet with palm oil or with ivy leaves.</end_of_turn
May it be known that if the swelling is from flesh, then suspend that one, and prick that.
And let the medicines be such as can stop the flow of blood, such as alum, and saffron, and oil, adjusted with vinegar.</end_of_turn>

And keep it for a while and give a cold compress.</end_of_turn

For in many cases these things happen when the greater parts of other flesh are born, and the time that must be covered is in this manner.</end_of_turn Indeed, if there is swelling of the head, the swelling of the head which is in the greater part should not be contrary to the iron in any way.</end_of_turn

Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and swellings when they are in the groin of the greater part and do not appear to the feeling, the time in those is not to give iron care.</end_of_turn
Indeed, those which are in the groin of the greater part concerning which there is sensation, those are cured.</end_of_turn
And keep the woman in greater warmth and approach a thigh with rough towels or coarse wool, and prick them at the roots.</end_of_turn
And sprinkle over those the blood flows from one of the incisions of the wound, as in the case of acacia and similar to that.</end_of_turn
And keep the legs covered for an hour, and then stop that in cold water.</end_of_turn
And if the bleeding persists, the time will come to make decoction of gum and of poppy seeds and of gum and of fragrant herbs and of similar things.</end>

Therefore you must consider if the pain of the abscess in the thigh at the beginning is acute with percussion and flexion and fever, and sometimes when it covers itself and when you touch it there is no longer any feeling, the time is not to perforate it, and care for that which helps with the maturity until the acute of the accident is over.</end_of_turn
And thus he commands that you cut the female organ above a navel that has two navels; recline on the seat and adjust your feet to the part beyond the belly, and your thighs will expand, and rest your arms beside your knees, and tie whatever you like to it conveniently.
And thus he follows the matrix following the bladder and administer the instrument with which he has opened the orifice of the great one, the shape of which will come in those cases that make it necessary.
And thus he commands that when you are administering this instrument, you remain close to the root of the female organ, and that what comes out of the instrument into the female organ be no more than the root of the female organ, and cause no harm to the patient If the instrument is larger than the root of the female organ, he commands that you cover the texture of the root of the female organ with powder so that the insertion of any instrument into the root of the female organ is prohibited
And he commands that you stop the vomiting that runs in the bladder after it has been used and that the minister hold the instrument and rotate the vomiting until it is opened up to the orifice of the great one.
And when the discharge comes out, which is grasped with the hand and is lean and slimy, he commands that you wipe away that which you must leave at the place with the sponge of lint
And when the urine is evacuated, he commands that you place in the wound a soaked sponge in olive oil or green oil in which there is any irritation; and rest the heel on the section in the root of the female organ.
And rest the female organ and cover the wound with a clean cloth soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.
And thus he commands that it be cured two days from today until tomorrow, when it is convenient to do so.
And many times the female organ is washed and the wound is cleansed that it is crystallized with water and honey, and then with water in which radish or long parsley is boiled, and then return to the enguent.
And if the wound is delayed in the female organ by the fever, he commands that you do not use any other cure except that which has been said in the division
Chapter 165
To teach the matrons how they should behave when they see a patient who is suffering from a non-natural condition.
It is necessary that the matron know at the beginning the figure of natural childbirth so that she will recognize the signs of it, for when a woman gives birth she expels the parts beyond the belly and desires to smell the air, and this is done because of what is above her, and she is tormented by this part, the hour she understands that this part is in a natural figure, and that is the sign of her head, and the second one is when it is hanging or suspended or pendant from the navel.
Therefore when you see these signs, he commands that the belly be pressed so that the embryo comes down slightly from the head, so that it will rest on the second one, and be protected from these superabundances with good management
If another part is not natural and unusable, for when the embryo is ejected from its feet and the body of the fetus is ejected before the head of the fetus, and the hand or the foot of the fetus, or both, that is to say... or the head is ejected and the hand is ejected, or the belly of the fetus, and it is greatly converted on the navel, and it is similar to the figures that are not usable.
It is necessary that the matron be wise and discreet in all these matters, and that she avoids error and deception
And thus I have shown you all the figures of those things, and what is their meaning so that you may understand what it is and remain silent about it.
When the fetus comes out naturally through the head, and that is violent on the woman and is done with difficulty, sometimes the virtue of the women is already exhausted, he commands that you do what the women have, and that you vaporize the knowledge of them with the fennel seed and with warm oil
And thus he orders that the matron be interpolated between the thighs which are said to be spit out small and open that one or cut that one with her nail until it runs dry of the humidity that is in it And press the belly of the woman until it comes down from the fetus.
And if it does not come out, he commands that the woman be cleansed with mucus of peas and fennel mucus with salt.
And command them to compress their belly and chest, and to hold their breath for an hour; and cover their mouth and nose with something so that they forget their pain for a while.
If the pain in the foot has already subsided somewhat at the beginning, then command that you gradually reduce the pressure. If they do not obey your instructions, then place the foot on a stool and lift their legs up, and then gently press the stool down so that the foot does not slip off the cushion
If the pain does not subside, then take hold of their foot and pull their limb toward your chest until the limb becomes limp, for the pain will be forgotten then.
When the foot is healed, then command that you gently massage their legs and make the foot small, and gradually engorge it, and take hold of one leg and gently extend the other limb little by little.
When they are quiet within the space, then command them to expel their breath and make that they cough, for the pain will be forgotten if God wills it
And if the pain has not been forgotten as we have recommended, then command that you gradually return the limb to its natural position until you see that the pain has completely disappeared, for the pain will be forgotten by itself at that moment.
And if it is prohibited in everything that we have recommended, then take a high dose of musellage of alum and dissolved gum, and prick all over the foot for a good bruise, and keep their hand on the area to prevent the pus from coming out of the wound.</start_of_turn> And do that for a lukewarm bath, until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn>
And when the limbs are softened, then command that you apply a fumigation of myrrh and take a pause for them.</start_of_turn When the fumigation has lasted for an hour, then command that you place it on a stool, and make them cough and open their mouth wide, and take away that, and press the lower part of the belly with your hand, applying some pressure, for the pain will be forgotten then.</start_of_turn
When the foot is completely healed laterally while one of their limbs is still swollen.</start_of_turn Work on reducing their hand, even if you cannot achieve that, command that you lift the foot and make them walk.</start_of_turn
If they cannot walk, then command that they sit on the ground, and support their limbs with a violent bruise, and administer to them the remedies that I have recommended and mucilages.</start_of_turn
If they become angry, then command that they sit on a stool, and study how to reduce the hand, and gently engorge the foot according to its natural shape, and make them cough and command them to compress themselves until they are forgotten.</start_of_turn
When the foot is lying with the heel expanded, expand their limbs and the area of their foot is two-thirds of their height.</start_of_turn And that the matron has the hand of the foot and gradually rotate that little by little, and make it easier.</start_of_turn
When it is as it should be and the foot is well-engorged, then command that you rest for a while on the area where we have recommended olive oil and mucilages.</start_of_turn
And command them to move their hand little by little, and when they feel better, command that they sit on a stool and tilt their head slightly forward, and command them to compress themselves; and make them cough so that they forget their pain.</start_of_turn The fetus is prepared for birth on the wide side.
When the mother screams in agony like this, consider it, and when you pierce her with your finger until it evacuates the moisture
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and the side of the body, then pierce that of the navel, so that it is not retained and remains.
Then pull the fetus towards the flanks until you reach the navel, and command the woman to press her thighs together, and if the sirrah has forgotten something essential, tell her immediately that she has forgotten it, because God or no
The birth of twins or many fetuses. It is wise that twins born together with other vegetables are born alive; and some say that three or four are born at once, which is strange and seldom happens; however, this is not for lack of nature, but for life itself.
And count those who are multiplied, whether by one or more, and are separated by the navel cord from each of those who have been delivered, for each of those who are born together naturally forgets something as a fetus is naturally curious, and so there are some who are forgotten even though they are truly excellent.
And if they are difficult to deliver, you must encourage them and persevere until we have mentioned the unnatural figures, for you must care for those as we have recounted
And if the midwife is skillful and does what is necessary to facilitate and expedite delivery, and is ingenious according to every figure according to what is prepared for her from the imminent danger of life.
Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos and aborts.
Some veins are formed in a woman one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and sometimes nine times, and it is enough to verify that a woman has borne six times, and another nine times altogether, causing great pain due to measurement of the glorious scholars.</end_of_turn>
And so it is necessary to know the science of the midwife that she is strong in that she can deliver such a multitude of children, and therefore she should be praised for that which she does so well
Chapter 166.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you care for a dead fetus as we have said in the division of medicine and it does not go out naturally, and you must use surgery with care, then you must consider whether the woman is of sound mind and not subject to any of the accidents for which she is feared to be in danger of miscarriage
Then you must cover the woman over her thighs with a sheet, and incline her head downwards and elevate her thighs.
And the minister holds her by two parts or ties her with a sheet so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus
And then wet the mouth of the mother with oil of lilies and mucus of elderberry and fennel and seed of rue.
And then the midwife takes her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then helps her to hold her hand firmly in the mother's hand, and then she seeks with her hand in the place where the nails remain in the fetus.
And look carefully in what place: when you consider that the fetus is ready to be born head first, and when you find the nails in the heel of the foot, or in the head, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or leave the hair, or the tonsils, or the ribs, or in the proper places of the flanks, or leave the navel cord
And if it is delivered headfirst, when it is in the fifth or in the middle of the flanks
Then hold the nail with your left hand, and suspend the curvature of the limb in that place where it is between the thumb and the little finger, and help her with your hand and stay with the nail in one of those places that we have mentioned, until the cause of pain comes.
And so stay close and remain in the position of the limb until another nail appears, or the third if necessary, so that it is an equal traction, and not an extension only as before
The joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrates the entire body, and when it affects the feet, doctors usually call it gout.
And cover them in it where there is between them that the extension is softened; and if any part of them is retained, then cover that the matron put an egg-shaped weight on the same side with oil and insert those expected to be expelled and rotate those that are retained.
Therefore if the part of the foot is extruded, then let the nails be cut between the places where it is pus; and do so until all of the foot is extruded
But if the hand is extruded from the other, and it is not possible to reduce it by the support of the cushion, then cover that hand with a bandage; and extract that until all is extruded, and insert it either into the joint of the hand or into the wound
And thus cover that the other hand and the two feet are covered as well.
But if the head of the foot is great, or if it is afflicted with the support in the suffering, or if there is water adjusted in the head, then cover that you insert between these teeth the spicery and split the head and extract the water, or that you drain it with an instrument called “alundat”, the shape of which will be like the shapes of the other instruments in the capital which is similar to this.
And in the same way do if the foot is of great head by nature: and cover that you insert that sponge, or that you support that sponge just as we have said; and extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is extruded and is supported behind the collarbone, cover that it is split until the humidity that is in the feet is evacuated.
But if it is not complicated, or if it does not obey this suffering, then cover that you insert the head as much as possible according to your skill
And if there is swelling of the belly or if it is in hydrosis, cover that you perforate that until the humidity that is in it is expelled
But if the foot is over the knees, the traction of it is light and the direction of it to the mouth of the thigh is light.
But if it is supported behind the belly and the foot, cover that you extract that which has been wrapped around your hand, and split the belly and the foot until the water that is in them runs out
But if the other limbs are relaxed and the head is returned, the matron inserts the left hand; but if the mouth of the thigh is open, the matron inserts the hand into the groin, grasps the head, and pulls that which is said to go into the mouth of the thigh, and at the same time inserts one or two nails into it and pulls them out toward those.
But if the mouth of the thigh is closed by swelling caused by the cautery, cover that it is not beaten over it; and cover that you administer an effusion of oily humors. And administer plasters; and keep the patient in waters that soften and hydrate him.
But if the foot is over the knee, if possible, is to be ligated: and to be administered what has been said of the foot living
But if that is not possible, cover that it is pierced in pieces, and that it is extracted<end_turn>
And cover that you do not leave any cause of dizziness from the second time<end_turn>
And when you have completed your operation, cover that you administer what has been said of the care of the cautery which has happened to the thigh.
And if an abscess occurs, cover that you drain in styptic waters and administer the other care.
And indeed I have already seen a woman in the belly of whom there was a dead foot, and I put another sponge over that one, and the other foot was dead. It happens to me or to someone long time postpartum in the belly; and it inflates until the foot or thigh is broken.
And I was called to their care, and I treated them for a long time, and the plague was not consolidated
Then I placed my hand over their chest, for there was a strong attraction and expulsion from there, and I passed my fingers over their body, and expelled another; and I was amazed that there was no swelling in the belly.
And then I thought that these were the bones of the foot that had died.
Therefore I applied the poultice, and I extracted from them four bones, the fifth being in the heel which exists in thousands, and I had seen in this way for a long time, corrected from them a little bandage
And I did not believe that I was mistaken, but that in this case science and the doctor's art are of assistance in administering the cure.
As for the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the foot.
Like the way of seeing where the major opening is made:
This is the way of holding the limb in which the veins are ligated, to which two incisions are made at the ends of two toes May the incision therefore be made as small as possible, and may be made with a needle or with the edge of a knife or with the tip of a pair of scissors.</start_of_turn>
And the width of each incision should be as much as two fingers, and the margin of each should be as much as one finger, and the length of each should be one palm and a half; and between two veins there should be two adjustments of that middle vein which are already closed, of which the length should be half a palm and a little more, and the width of each should be as much as two fingers, or a little more.</start_of_turn
And these two additional incisions are made at the mouth of the major opening so that it is opened with those two precautions which you have just mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Another form similar to the previous one, but more subtle and lighter.</start_of_turn
It is made with a needle or with the edge of a knife or with the tip of a pair of scissors according to the shape of forceps.</start_of_turn However, at the end of these there are two additional incisions like sometimes, and the length of these additional incisions is as much as a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.</start_of_turn
And when you want to open the major opening, then do so by making the fifth [metatarsal] bone rest upon the bones of the foot, open what is between the thighs of the patient.</start_of_turn And then place your hand over the instruments in the way that is done with forceps according to the quantity that you wish of the opening of the major opening so that the uterus makes room for it.</start_of_turn
The way of making the incision which the ancient authors said:
The way of making the incision which I mentioned before in which the foot is impaled.</start_of_turn>
The way of making the incision which I mentioned before in which the great toe is contained.</start_of_turn
And it is similar to forceps in which teeth are at the end, like sometimes, and several veins are like this made long like forceps in this way, like sometimes, to which teeth are like teeth of a saw in which the incision is made and contained.</start_of_turn The way of making a small incision.</start_of_turn
The way of making an incision with a pointed spine.</start_of_turn
The way of making an incision with two pointed spines.</start_of_turn
The way of making an incision with two extremities at which the top is cut off.</start_of_turn
The way of making two parallel incisions.</start_of_turn
All these instruments are exercises, and when there are many varieties of these and they are prepared, the doctor must know how to manage them, for the more curious one is the operation and the more skillful one is the man for the quantity.</start_of_turn
And do not work with these instruments unless you are absolutely certain that you must, for the necessity of these is not excusable.</start_of_turn
Of the extraction of the second toe.</start_of_turn
When the second toe is retained you must support the ankle, and command the patient to flex the knee, and then stretch your hand over the mouth of the limb and over the nails of the limb, and if in doing so it is pushed out, do not be afraid.</start_of_turn
If so, take an ointment and make a hole in the covering over the wound and place it on those herbs which open the mouth of the mother, thus with warmth and quickly and with alum, chamomile, saffron, arabic gum and mastic tree and rue. All these herbs or some of them are immersed in water in the ointment, and place that over the fire.
And put a tube of canewhere in the mouth of the mother, and keep that inside until the vapor comes out towards the cavity of the mother
And do that again as we have said, and the second time throw it away with speed.
But if it remains close to this cure and is not expelled, when you command the midwife to immerse your left hand in olive oil or in milk of elder, and when you have introduced that into the wound and until it has become soft, when that has been found, take hold of it and gradually stretch it out, but if it is attached to the mother's belly, take hold of her hand as we have recommended, and when you have found the second one, pull that out little by little as directed so that the mother does not suffer excessive pain. And be careful that it is exchanged from the right side to the left with ease
And if the mouth of the mother is closed, as we have already recommended, the cure with turning and ointment of the ointment with herbs.<end_turn>
But if it is not expelled in all the ways we have recommended, know that you must not tire excessively at that attempt of extraction, however, cover that which comes out of her to the mouth of the mother lies in the cushion, and put a plaster on that which is left over; for that will prevent that from coming out again for several days and when it has dissolved and is expelled.
When it has become soft, it is of great bad odor to the head and the stomach, and that brings about the disease; and know that those things must be administered under fumes and with convenience to that which is appropriate for the disease.
And indeed of the ancients, some already know the sub-fumigation of rue and dry figs.<end_turn>
A kind of instrument in which the woman is sub-fumigated must be due to the retention of menses and the second one:
Whether by seeing or by hearing.<end_turn>
And be placed the inner limb in the wound and the outer limb over the fire, and the sub-fumigation be placed over the sleeves of the fire.<end_turn
And keep that inside until that sub-fumigation is consumed and do it again.<end_turn
For the cure of the child's buttocks that are not perforated.<end_turn>
The child cries and their buttocks are not perforated, which already happen secretly and softly. Then command the midwife to pierce as we have said that which already happens secretly; and if not, pierce that with a pointed cautery, and keep that it does not touch the skin.
And place over that cloth soaked in wine and oil; and keep that inside until it is settled.<end_turn
But if you fear that it is softened, know that you must place in the hole for several days a tube to prevent the child from suffering.<end_turn
And indeed sometimes the softening of the buttocks is caused by the consolidation of pus or of swelling; know that that consolidation must be softened, and that it must be cured with the things that we have said of the cure and of the plaster.
For the cure of fistulas that arise from behind.<end_turn
The fistulas that arise in the lower part of the buttocks are nodular and bulky, which arise from the buttock or in the space of the one part.<end_turn
And it is a fistula or boils.<end_turn
And when that nodulus is old and corrupted by the white or soft humidity, and some herbs of these fistulas some penetrate.<end_turn
And those that penetrate are known for that they come out with the evacuation and with the wind; and some women use the bad evacuation of the bowels, and as a result comes out from those things.
E so de aquelas fistulas alcunas veguadas en l’espazi penetrantz entro a la vesica, e entro al meat de la vergua; e so de aquelas penetrantz entro la junctura de la coyssa e entro al notz de la coeta.
And that which is known as fistula which penetrates into the belly and does not penetrate, is that you must tell him that it is at the end of the belly, and that you must try to remove it with a needle or with fire when it is crooked.
May be if it is crooked, then you must enter into that attempt with a plum or the hair of a horse to sit on that needle or to hold it in the belly
And if you do not succeed in that from the beginning, nor does any cause of egestion or vomit or wind come from this, as we have said, then it is not penetrating, and you must take care of it.
And when the fistula penetrates the bladder or into the meat of the heel, the meaning of it is that there is urine from that and the prohibition of eating until the place is solidified by medicine.
May be if it penetrates the joint or the bone and inflammation of pain in the circumference, the sign of it is that the needle has passed through here if it is not crooked through the bone, and inflammation of pain in the circumference of the part; and that from this it is reduced in every way; and that it has no value in this medicine, neither is it solidified at once.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no cure except work and the diligence of the doctors concerning which we must speak.
But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, recovery with fire is hoped for as you will order, and what I have already said and done
And it is that the patient has opened between his thighs to the groin and has placed cushions under them, and has put his thighs against his belly, and has put his hand on the belly to prevent the intestines from coming out.
And if that is his case, you must tell him that it is at the end of the belly
And if you sit on the belly the needle has already passed by itself to uncover, or another that you sit between the belly and that bladder or vein, then it is certainly penetrating; and do not work on that, for that is not in that healing, as we have said
However I say that in some homes it is healthy in some people.
And concerning the medicine by which it is hoped to help in this case, it is that you make a pointed cautery subtle according to the width of the fistula, as it has been said before, and you insert that ignition into the fistula until it reaches the belly; and then repeat that two or three times until you see that all those tissues adjusted to the fistula which seem like feathers of owls have been softened
And take care of that which is wrapped in cloth around the border until all those tissues which have been adjusted are soft, and take care of that which is the medicine which engenders and consolidates the flesh, and if it is healed, it is well; but if not, it is not well in any other treatment
And if the needle enters and does not penetrate into the belly which is at the end of the belly between that and the needle which is very close to flesh or vein, and sometimes the fistula in which it sees the surface of the heel, the sign is that it dries up the heel from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry up on the needle, and it is liberated from the fistula when the incision reaches the place where the extremity of the needle has gone, and for the needle is freed and catched
And so soften those tissues which are put together like a feather pen of owls and do not remain from any cause
However if sometimes blood comes between you and your operation when you burn those tissues, it is better to cauterize with fire or acute medicine, because the cautery with fire adjusts well many bad habits: so is the adjuction of those tissues which have been adjusted, and the excision of the blood excedent of the humidity.
And take care of that which is wrapped in cloth around the border or in causes distress until the part gets cold, and take care that the hour the plague is on the tough flesh is inflamed, engendered and consolidated
And so medicines in which there is styptic and excision; when the hour is restored it is healed and you do not fear repetition
However if the fistula has already passed into the groin and is elongated from its surface of the body, then tell him that you must tell him about that
Therefore, if you sense the tentacles and between you and her there is either bile or blood, and it is likely due to penetration, do not perform an operation on her except according to the way of faith and hope.
The cause of which is to administer in her three ways: either that you cauterize that area as we have said; or that you drain that which you consider to cause the curvature of her [foot] in order that it is possible for you to introduce the instruments and the cure itself; and do not proceed without causing damage to the wound containing the bone, and that you take care of the patient immediately regarding the exit of the disease; or that you strengthen that which we have said that is strong if she is sick; or that you stretch her out very much and tell her to pull out that pus which you drained from her foot, just as we have said, or with another sharp instrument, and that you modify those wounds that have burst open which are in the incision that you make; and that you endeavor to restore the whole of the wound that you opened, and if the pus is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the foot, and if there is still pus in the wound. And sometimes the fistula is ended in this way: when you insert the finger into the fistula, and it is at the back of the foot around the surface of the body and on the edge of the foot, then take hold of the finger and perforate the extremity, that is just as if you were preparing the flesh in this way.</end_of_turn>
and insert it into that firm covering of flesh or around those; and then insert the finger with force into the fistula until you have caused the curvature of her foot.</end_turn>
Maybe if it has penetrated the edge of the foot properly, then extract the thread from that wound as soon as you have introduced it into the foot; and extract the extremity of the thread and adjust the two extremities even, and bind each one, and keep her quiet for a day or two, and when it has subsided somewhat reintroduce the thread into the flesh; and when those flesh has been injured between the two extremities of the thread and has become soft, break it off.</end_turn>
And take care of the wound until it is consolidated and healed.</end_turn>
Maybe if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then do that which will penetrate, in whatever way you are prepared, but do not do it carelessly, for that would be your fault if you were to cause her injury; and do that until it is healed.</end_turn
The way of treating the spiny thorn of which the fistula is formed: the curvature of which is not acute and the other part is not blunt, so do not cause any damage that is not necessary, even as sometimes.</end_turn
Suturing of wounds in which there is running suture in the incision of those.</end_turn
Wounds are of two kinds, either those that remain between the thighs as if they were of cartilage, or those that are like grass seeds.</end_turn And of those there are small and large, and that run from these to these places and is one, and is not many, and is outside the thigh, and in the extremities of the thigh.</end_turn
But indeed those that are outside the thigh are according to the measures of little humidity, of which run citrine water or a little of white ointment continuous, and according to the color of the flesh.</end_turn
And the treatment of that which is inside the bone is that you order the patient to rest and express himself until the bone is healed and the wounds appear on you.</end_turn Then you will keep me shut and suspend the thread or that you have at your nail, and in this way you will prevent them from bleeding.</end_turn
Maybe if you do not have nails in those for the humidity of them and their softening, then take the thread from those which you have at your nails and make it rough or thick or flabby of wool, and extract those from the wound, and then insert those again and sprinkle over them some fine powder near the incision, so that it adheres to them instead of cauterizing; or cauterize those as it is said in the chapter on cauterizing.</end_turn And take care of those as well as with the other treatment until they are healed.</end_turn
And if the thigh does not obey discharge, then order the patient to cry out in the place where there is slight pain, and wash it with the water that is in the bone and let her discharge willingly when the patient groans.
Maybe if the wounds are outside the thigh, the cause of them is light, and that you take hold of those with your nail, or that you take hold of those with a thread, and insert them, and take care of those with water as we have said until they are healed.</end_turn
He guessed the translation as follows:
And thus do all these things, and leave one of them out and do not burn them, so that the excess of the sacred oil may flow from that.
And then place your hand over the groin immersed in rose oil or in beeswax; and place that over the heel and command the patient to rest. And then leave that enter which case; and when it is closed, care for those at ease or another care within that it be healed.
And since they are ancient and have no value in that medicine, when you see that they are moist and the pus that comes out is soft and hosts the scurf of pus that prevents them from solidifying; then care for them until they are solidified
When you see them again in a more violent way than the first time when they are raw and are excoriated; then care for them until they are healed
You must know that to apply pressure is key, and it is not if you do not notice redon according to the color of the body resembling the head of a nail, and it is useful in all parts of the body and especially in the lower parts of the feet and the buttocks, and because of these pains you must support them.</start_of_turn>
And then cover that which is in the circuit of the key, and keep it with forceps or a clamp, and extirpate it from its root; and then care for that.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize according to what is said beforehand in the head of the capital.</start_of_turn
More of a verucca is a small rough fistula round about the surface of the body, and moist wounds are found in most of the children.</start_of_turn
And the care of them is to stretch and scratch that, or to stretch that with a faithful thread or with a needle inside the box.</start_of_turn And if you wish, cauterize that as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.</start_of_turn
More of a wasp is a small fragrant or large fistula around about the surface of the body appearing like a bruise in it, and is useful around the body.</start_of_turn
And the care of them is that you take a needle of fine awl or of needle of turtle, and that it is strong, and place that on the wasp inside that it contains the circle of the needle of the parts of it; and then rotate your hand with the needle until you have instilled what is in the circuit of the wasp, and place that in the crease of the flesh and that you evacuate the wasp from its root.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, do that with a needle of barley or iron according to this manner:
The part behind the needle will draw towards softness, deaf (that is not perforated), enclosed so that over the thumb the learning of the hand is ablated and the revolution of that.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize the wasp as it is said above in the cauterization of the vein in the head of the cautery.</start_of_turn
In the way of the instruments that are administered to give comfort.</start_of_turn
Some moist wounds are useful for the comfort of silver or lead or tin or malleable; and some moist wounds are useful for those instruments that are administered, for those that are administered in the care of young children should be small; and for those of which the buttocks are rough or painful, the comforts of those are small.</start_of_turn
The form of great and little comfort.</start_of_turn
The head of the needle in which the bag is bound is wide according to this manner; and be distinguished by that where the bag is bound thus as often.</start_of_turn
The limb affected with the pus is that which is included in the groin (so it is not opened like a lion), lagging behind slightly; and on one side of the limb there are two incisions, and on the other side one, and the size of the incision is according to the size of the rays, and the larger the better.
And the dressing in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of goat's skin are placed, and the size of it should be like a palm
And it should be pierced with four incisions as if it were a wheel; and if the space between the incisions is the thickness of a finger
And insert into those incisions faithfully strong thread, or around those; and adjust so that the dressing is firm; and when it is placed in them the dressing should be straight on the tip of the penis between two cushions, and press firmly on each incision: the better the quality of pressing on each is that you fill the dressing with medicine, which should be scaled according to the amount of the patient's tolerance; and take care that it is not too cold or too hot
And the patient should be placed lying down on the two buttocks, and lift up their limbs above and rest them on something on which they already rest or a cushion; and anoint the affected limb with oil or with white of egg or with fennel mucilage or with alum; and insert that into the groin with ease, and the minister should support the dressing and express that out through two more times with great force until it is evacuated in the belly all that is in the penis; and then remove the penis and the patient takes back their limbs to the side.
And if the medicine forces him to vomit, keep him under control as much as possible; and if he sleeps like that for the whole night, it is better to delay the treatment
Better if you keep quiet about the belly troubles and the vomiting of the patient, the hour you will repeat the cautery until he is healed.
And if in the groin there are embolisms or blood clots, the hour the penis should be stiff like a lion, from the penises with which the children are accustomed.
Take care of the plague.<end_turn>
I have already said in the division of the care of the plague that it was appropriate for the free man, and I say the same about the care of those with wounds and medicines according to the compliment
Therefore I say that the plagues are diversified according to the cause of the plagues and according to the place where the plagues occur
And the causes for which many people suffer from plagues are various, such as from a bite of a dog, or an incision of a space or a nail, or percussion with a lance, or with a fist, or with an arrow, or like those of many other causes
Better the plagues that are in the places of the body are like the plague which falls on the head, or on the arm, or on the leg, or on the belly, or on the heel, or like those of the members
And I recommend the care of some plagues so that you stop that reasoning and rule about the others.
And I will start with the simple head plagues, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter
Therefore I say that when there is a simple head plague and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is from a bite of a dog or something similar, and if it has only drunk the codena and it is a great plague and you fear that there will be a fistula because of it, then you should immediately cover the head and perform a cephalic flebotomy as soon as possible; and extract according to what is necessary of the virtue of the medicine, as long as there is no other prohibiting cause of flebotomy, especially if the medicine that is to be extracted is that of the plague and is little.
And the bleeding of the opposite side of the afflicted area; and keep the patient from eating and drinking and eating coarse food
Better if from the beginning you prohibit any cause of vomiting, although it is not prohibited, reduce the food and do not approach meat or wine
And rest until the plague, if there is a fistula caused by the cautery, soak in oil of rue solet or in wine where it is stipped.
Better if you are sure of the cautery fistula, the hour you rest until the plague, if it is recent at the buttocks and the air has not changed that dust which I recommend to remove little by little
And if the air has already changed that, the hour you rest until it is healed
May be if the plague is great or if it is due to insufficient space and crowding, and the lips of the patient are not adjusted for vomiting, then adjust those at the sutures according to what I recommend for the sutures of them.
Maybe if the plague has already been expelled from the limb and is not retention but a slight swelling, then prick it and apply medicine to the wound and restore the limb in its place instead of excision, and command the patient to abstain from eating foods that are coarse: heads and brains and the like for them, until it is digested.</end_of_turn>
And if you find decay in the limb and it does not adhere to the bone, then prick all around the area and evacuate it, and then apply medicine to it.</end_turn
Maybe if in these plagues there is an artery or vein from which blood flows of a healthy nature, and it is not closed by medicine, then inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is not closed, then prick it with the spatula or ligature; and if necessary you must cause that which we have said must not be done, then cauterize it until the blood is clotted.</end_turn>
And if these plagues are simple and small, then the cause of them is slight; thus sprinkle over them this powder, which when solidified will cause the air to dry them out.</end_turn
And the manner of the powder is this: take olive oil half a part, of blood one part, of vinegar two parts; let them all be ground together and sieved, and let the plague be filled with it, and let it be bound by good constriction until it adheres, and let it be coagulated with blood.</end_turn
Then strengthen it with those powders and read it, and do not remove it while it is still moist, for it is not eradicated by the medicine until it is healed.</end_turn>
And every doctor does this alone, when it is not at your presence oil and blood.</end_turn>
And this same operation has already been done in great plagues when it was considered necessary to suspend it over those and make them wide, and only in recent plagues with their blood still fresh, which has not altered them.</end_turn>
And if they have been altered, especially when it is in summer, then it is not understood to the position of this powder, however, do apply over those with water that has been digested, or over those barley grains in water and honey until it has become reduced; and apply the other treatment along with this.</end_turn
Maybe if an accident occurs in the plague fracture in bones, and it is small, then extract it with your hands.</end_turn
And I say the treatment of fractures of the head is that which is venomous.</end_turn
The provided text does not contain any information related to "plagues of the colon", so I am unable to translate or provide any context regarding this.
Maybe if the plague occurs in the colon, there is no difference in medication between it and the plague of the head when it is simple.</end_turn
Maybe if the nerves of the colon are cut or an artery, then if it is a nerve, it is not in their nature to take medication but to be treated with what makes violent stypticitation, thus as zinc and celery which is old and resembles them because it does not cause the nerves to swell and counteract that.</end_turn And do not remove any cause of all coolness, for the substance of the nerves is cold and the continuation of them is at the brain, which is the most important of all the members.</end_turn
And if it is necessary to cure it with medicines that are light, even as vinegar washed with lukewarm water, any vegetable smeared in olive oil or not, and throw it away when washed with lukewarm water and the other stones that are harmful must be removed according to this manner, and moisten.</end_turn
Maybe if the plague is great, then administer sutures, or bind the lips of the patient, and apply the powder until it is healed.</end_turn
Maybe if the plague is deep or has occurred in the lower part, then pierce that in the most depressed place.</end_turn
Maybe if in the plague the artery is already cut and blood flow is achieved, then separate or dry that, or ligate that, or cauterize that if necessary, because you are causing it.</end_turn
Maybe if the spondyles of the coccyx or all of them have already been cut, and the veins of the colon have been saved, then adjust the lips of the limb with sutures over the bone of the coccyx and do not touch that; leave that alone and reduce that to its natural figure, and strengthen that by stretching it down, and read that for several days; and apply that which causes stypticitation and excitement until it is healed.</end_turn
If the plague has already affected the bones, then pursue that [treatment], and if there are fragments of bone, extract them all; what is not injured, read it until the plague subsides, and whatever is not affected shall be separated and its evacuation alleviated.
If the plague is recent, then sprinkle gunpowder over that area for which you have recommended it.</end_of_turn> If there is a fistula in the plague, then cure that from which the memory will come to you in the groin.</end_of_turn>
If percussion of the flank or the breastbone, and sometimes of the lung, and at times the depth [of the wound], consider more if the patient has excessive wind in the belly; for the plague is mortal.</end_of_turn
And if there is no depth [to the wound] and the plague is recent at the surface of the skin, then for the first hour powder in it, and do not pull out that which would remain in the depth of the wound so that it returns to the heart and increases the patient’s pain, even though you pause in it immediately, remove those two veins from the patient for a while.</end_of_turn
And if the tongue is not at your present, then pause in the orifice of the plague close to the heel so that it sucks up what is from the humors; and make the patient sleep over the plague so that it runs out what is in it adjusted.</end_of_turn
If already of the plague three days have passed or more, and the patient has not had spasm or tremor of the body or severe abdominal pain or stricture of the belly, and sometimes other good signs of the patient, then know that the plague is saved; and then cure that with cold compresses and other treatments until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the healing of the patient is excused, and already a long time has passed, know that there is already a fistula; cure it therefore for the groin.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is from incision of the flank or the breastbone, and is simple on the surface of the foot or of the thigh, then cure that with the liquid which precedes suture, if it is great, or with powder, if it is small.</end_of_turn
If already there has been great pain in the bones, and so already has it been pierced through, then turn the plague and cover to extract those pieces, if they are separated.</end_of_turn If they are not separated, then read until the plague subsides, for its extraction is alleviated.</end_of_turn
And as for other plagues that happen in other members, the help in treatment is the help of what has been said.</end_of_turn
Of the belly plagues.</end_of_turn>
The discomfort that happens in the belly is either great, or little, or medium.</end_of_turn
And a slight rupture is a difficult thing by another method, and if you do not guard against the intrusion of them into the cavity of the belly so that it is open and swollen because the membrane of them is faulty.</end_of_turn
And therefore the best rupture is medium, because in that one the reduction of the gut is not difficult, even though it is difficult in the two preceding species.</end_of_turn
And know that the suture of the belly is done in four ways, more commonly in two sutures than in the sutures of the other plagues of the body.</end_of_turn
And two other sutures are common in other plagues, more indeed only in the suture of the belly.</end_of_turn
And I recommend to you that you should expose and declare everything.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that when the plague is slight and there is any cause of the gut for that, and it is difficult to reduce that, then it is in two ways: either for the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the gut is caused by cold air inflammation.</end>
Therefore when it is thus, you must cover that with your hand which you immerse a sponge of wool moistened in water on your head alone, or that you grasp in water squinant, and cypress, and pepper, and cloves until the inflammation is resolved.</end>
Every vegetable food makes the urine dark, and it is better to drink only water in the resolution of inflammation.
Therefore, when the inflammation has subsided, then you should moisten the belly with water, in which it is contained, because by this means the intestines are relieved with little discomfort
More if the intestines are released in this way, then immediately bind up the disruption with a small instrument with which wounds are usually stitched.</start_of_turn>
The first treatment is better when it is gentle and not too dry, and does not unnecessarily consume food.</start_of_turn>
About the instrument, its shape is like this:
One part is acute, and the other not acute, and the handle is slightly bent, but not to the point of being blunt, with the tip somewhat pointed.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when the disease is increased and the belly is protruded, then cover that its reduction should be in accordance with its natural form, in the place where it is, if possible above the wound, because that is better.</start_of_turn
More when the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, then cover that you place the patient on the two thighs and suspend their legs higher than the chest; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then suspend the head and the chest higher than the lower parts.</start_of_turn
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then keep your attention and your thought focused for a moment so that the part where the disease is should be higher than the other.</start_of_turn
And thus cover that you administer water in the large and small boils.</start_of_turn
And in the small boils, suspend water until it is prepared, and make sure that it is administered between the most painful parts, which has the whole disruption in its hand and adjusts the lips of the wound, and immediately uncover from that to that which may cause the suture to break for any reason.</start_of_turn
This is the common suture technique: that you grasp the needle, or with a needle holder according to the amount of the wound's amplitude; and immediately after you grasp the extremity of the disruption from the little finger, and tighten the needle one, or more as you do not trust in the two extremities of the codena, from the two extremities of the nipple that is left from the codena of the parts downwards, until you have penetrated from that part; and you have already added two extremities of the codena and two extremities of the nipple, so that there are four orders in total.</start_of_turn
And tighten firmly double in the circuit of the needle, and several vegetables from two parts together, and immediately add the two lips and the wound together; and immediately lay off the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that place, and immediately tie that one to this one as well as the first one; and do not stop until you have completed the entire contraction of the wound.</start_of_turn
And if the needles are small between coarseness and fineness, because the fine needles do not penetrate the flesh very willingly; and the coarse ones are difficult to introduce into the codena, therefore it is necessary that they should be moved in fineness and coarseness.</start_of_turn
And do not let the needle be fixed in two extremities of the codena too much, so that the flesh is not pierced too willingly and that the wound does not open before its consolidation.</start_of_turn
And do not prolong the suture too much so that the wound is not hindered from consolidation.</start_of_turn>
And immediately pierce the extremities of the needles so that they do not cause the patient to feel pain; and suspend the suture between expanded powder of every part, which has the extremities of the needles; and leave them in place until you believe that the wound is already consolidated.</start_of_turn
These methods of suture with needles are more convenient in small boils, because they allow for the suturing of several needles or two together around them.</start_of_turn
More the second suture is common: and that is that you administer with the suture the four extremities, of the codena and two extremities of the nipple, at once, with a needle in which is faithful envolopat engual in fineness and coarseness.</start_of_turn
And immediately when the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle of that middle part from which you began, so that the thread retracts box from the soft part that rises up from the wound, so that the suture is according to the suture of silk which is the strongest.</start_of_turn
Pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the great toe.
And this suture sews up the flesh.
And thus this suture sews up the wound which was caused by a person in the groin who was stung by a bee, and it was a disruption of the greater sciatic nerve from the bones around two palms of the foot, and it was the disruption of the median nerve; and thus I reduced that after the foot had been exposed to the wound for forty-two hours.</start_of_turn>
And the wound healed in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and it was cured; and thus I left it to rest, and it was conserved in its places.</start_of_turn
And the other doctors had said that it would not heal; and by a miracle, behold, I cured it without any other treatment, since in that place there was neither wound nor any medicine, but I simply kept the wound covered with two dressings a day and I washed it diligently with honey water until it healed.</start_of_turn>
But I say two kinds of sutures are proper according to the narration of Paraula.</start_of_turn
And thus you commence with a suture of the codena, and enter the needle from the outside to the inside.</start_of_turn
And thus when the needle penetrates the codena and in that middle lacerate according to the rule and in length throughout the whole body, and leave the end of the thread where you have introduced the needle; and make penetrate in the other extremity the needle from the inside to the outside of the body.</start_of_turn
And thus when you have finished making that penetrate, then make another penetrate in that middle part of the body from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this place, and make penetrate the needle in the other extremity from the inside to the outside of the body.</start_of_turn
And thus make penetrate in that way that the loop of your penetrate which is in the middle of the body which is in the part of the hand which is at the entrance of all those which penetrate.</start_of_turn
And thus begin from this middle side and grasp that part of the thread which is in the middle of the body which is at the entrance of all those which penetrate, and extract the needle from the codena which has penetrated, and thus reduce that in that codena and close the part of the thread which is in the other side with this part of the hand; and extract that from the codena which is on the part of the hand.</start_of_turn
And thus make a loop and another, and make a loop like this until you have closed all that which is outside according to that example.</start_of_turn
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a suture of skin over which you sew the hair, in such a way that you sew the thread of the part of the extremity of the codena, and that you leave that other thread until it is finished.</start_of_turn
But the second kind of suture which I say is proper is that of Gualia, and this is to say as regards to her and for her it is recommended that you sew that according to the manner in which other physicians sew that, namely that you add all parts to their proper part to them conveniently; and apply the one end of them to the other end of them, and that is done as I have recommended to you.</start_of_turn
Since you have left the needle in the part of the hand at your pleasure from the outside, make it penetrate from the outside to the inside of this sole, and leave two ends of the thread; and then reverse the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside of the two ends of the thread.</start_of_turn
And thus reverse those loops, and make penetrate whatever is from the part of the thumb inwards into the part of the outside of the two parts of the hand in two other places.</start_of_turn
And this manner of suture is better than the common lighter suture, and it is a suture of which there is precedent.</start_of_turn
This is the manner of Gualia.</start_of_turn
And thus I shall tell you, the belly suture is rectified with two needles, so that you enter into these with any thread, and begin with the introduction of the needle from that which is next to you, and make that penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those which sew the wounds together.</start_of_turn
And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, the hour of the suture of it is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.</start_of_turn
The greatest judgment of the plague is the judgment of the other plagues.
When you notice the recent plague and its foul air, reduce the swelling and boils, and remove the dust and dirt from the wound appropriately, then stop over the fleshy powder
And if the air has already altered the plague, then stop over the plague immediately, while it still makes the flesh hard and causes them to swell; consolidate them with fingers and look; then care for it as for the other plagues until it is healed
If you do not have the medicines at hand, then stop over the plague as much as possible, for it begins to vomit blood, yellow bile and evacuates two stools a day, as you have seen and learned, until it is healed; for you should not take any other medicine in vain when the plagues are simple.
If you fear that the plague communicates by wound to the principal members, then cover that you immerse linen soaked in olive oil of good quality, or in scented olive oil, and stop it in the area between the armpits and leave them covered.
If there is pain or putrefaction in the joints, which cause these veins to swell, then apply a black sticking plaster there, especially if the ulcer has penetrated the bone and is very painful.
Know that the one that is of the great bone is of lighter pus than that which is in the small bones.</start_of_turn>
And it is difficult to heal because the bone called "gegunu" does not recover from the plague that enters it whole; for there are many veins in it and it is large, and because of the body of the bone and its proximity to nerves.</start_of_turn>
If what proceeds from the plague is the fabric, and you have just seen the recent one, reduce it according to your custom for swelling of the joints.</start_of_turn
If it has passed to the space and is already green or black, then strengthen it firmly over the area that is defiled by it, so that there flows out of it a flux of health, for there are veins and arteries in the fabric.</start_of_turn
And so do the incisions that are another of those ligaments, and suspend two extremities of the thread pending the part where the plague has passed through, for over you there will be relief of the attraction of it from the tissue and emission of the blood of the plague.</start_of_turn
Remember the plagues when they happen in the bone.</start_of_turn>
When there is disruption in the bone and it is slight, it is possible that it will be cured in the flesh, in order to prevent the one which was placed inside from remaining there because of the expansion of the belly and the fistula, and because of the vomiting and diarrhea.</start_of_turn
Then we will follow the treatment of it even though we did not have confidence in the healing of it, but we will continue to subtilize it until it is healed and the area is consolidated.</start_of_turn
And we must say that the area is already consolidated, time to go over the illness that happened in the belly; and do not take anything for that bad accident except for food and drink, and to rest in bed and be exercised in these things.</start_of_turn
And we have already said that some experienced people say that when the plague is in the bone and is slight, it should be bound in this way: take large caps; and put two fingers of the plague between the toes and hold one finger of the plague over the two fingers of the plague; thus, when you press on those and open your mouth, the head will break off and adhere and will not be dissolved.</start_of_turn
And so do another finger for the first one, and do not cease until you have made as many fingers as there are in the whole plague.</start_of_turn
Then reduce that and cover the plague; and leave those heads attached to the bone until the bone is healed; and do not cause any damage to the illness.</start_of_turn
And it is possible that the bone is bound with the thread that is natural to the beast's bone, because it is finer; take the extremity of these bones and do not cut it off, and bind the extremity to the thread with a knot, encase it, and put that thread through needles and sew it into the bone, and reduce that which is in the disruption.</start_of_turn
And this way of stitching with fingers is nothing but by faith and hope.</start_of_turn
If the plague is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the small joints, then the cause is not violent but subtle, and it is not the healing of them all.
From the care of worms and fistula.</end_of_turn>
You know that every plague and swelling, when it grows old and becomes antique, is an ulcer, and is not solidified, and lasts always and is not separated, that in whatever part it is, is universally called fistula and we call that one worms.</end_of_turn>
And fistula truly is a foul, hard, white nodule to which there is no pain and which has a cavity just as a wound of an ulcer; and for this reason it is called a wound risk, that is, a wound.</end_of_turn
And it is in a wound of wet humors, which lasts a long time; and when the wetness is dried up, it is separated in a few hours.</end_of_turn And every vegetable of this moisture is mobile, and is little, and is great, and is subtle.</end_of_turn
All those causes have already been shown, and the treatment of them with medicines has been explained in the division.</end_of_turn
And so I tell you the treatment of fistula which is useful by means of an operation with the hand.</end_of_turn
You know that fistula can happen in all parts of the body; that some of these fistulas go through great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the brain, or the belly, or the bladder, or the ribs, or some of the vertebrae of the spine, or any of the compound joints like the hand and foot; and of these that give proximity to the main limb and resemblance.</end_of_turn
Therefore, of these fistulas which are treated in this way, those that are according to this manner are among the diseases of difficult healing, and do not receive cure, and require work and ignorance.</end_of_turn
And if it is of any fistula whose depth you do not perceive to reach these places that I have said, and you hope and trust in the treatment of it, and you wish to achieve cognition of it, then you take hold or grasp with your hand, and if the fistula follows the rule, and inquire about it.</end_of_turn
If the fistula is crooked, then investigate that which is in the palm of the hand, for the palm with the elevation of the body is alleviated and curved over the crookedness.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is full of horrible bones, it is not possible for you to understand it by your attempt.</end_of_turn
Therefore glorify the Lord for his works, for the humidity for which you glorify him goes away from the other works and comes from them.</end_of_turn
And inquire carefully according to what manner is possible for you to know if here are bones or nerves, and is the curvature of the fistula long or short, or is it a fistula to which there are multiple bones and this is above all that you have of strength, of your inquiry, of the things that you inquire about, and the invention of the pain due to your compression with your hand over the area, and resemblance to the signs and the causes of the swelling.</end_of_turn
And when you have stood over all these causes at rest, then go to the treatment with confidence: and that is that you consider whether the fistula is apparent close to the skin, long in the joint, or of nerves, or of arteries, or veins, or in any of the places that I have told you.</end_of_turn
Then dry the fistula as it is said in the narration, and remain there until what is in that filtration and putrefied flesh is gone, and what is born in the wound of the flesh, or of the blood vessels, or of resemblance, and cure that which enters until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the fistula is of great depth, and is according to the rule, then cover that with your thumb as much as possible, and at the same time soften all your corrupted flesh; and give lukewarm compresses with acute medicines, and introduce those into the cavity of the fistula which you have understood with the hand.</end_of_turn
And thus we shall say that whatever is seen within which the acute medicine has eaten away all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
Then restore that which was burned with carbolic substances which produce healthy flesh until it is healed
More likely if it is not healed by this, then cauterize that as we have recommended
More likely if the cause of the fistula is bone, then you must confirm that, and dry that as we have recommended, if you do not prevent any cause of vein or nerve or major limb as we have said.
More likely if it is found in the bone and there is some corruption and blackness, then you must burn that out until the corruption is completely gone; and then care for that which is burned out until it is healed
And if it is not healed and emits black pus as before, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption; and now uncover it further and inquire into the cause of it and the alteration of that which is burned out with the utmost care, and restore that.</start_of_turn>
And thus if it is healed, well and good; but if not, know that that corruption is in the profound depth of the body, which has not been reached, and therefore lay open that which is not useful but only harmful.</start_of_turn>
And if the corruption of the bone is small, or you are able to draw that out, then draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.</start_of_turn
And if so many bones are moved, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any cause of weakness in your strength.</start_of_turn
More likely if there is any cause of moisture there, and at the beginning there is no fear or mistake, then pierce those ligaments or flesh if they are here, and deliver the bones.</start_of_turn
More likely if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then stop over the wound that has been made to allow the wound to heal, and leave that until the bones of flesh and ligaments are expelled, and keep the wound from solidifying, and keep the incision which you have made in your operation restricted.</start_of_turn
Indeed, if you are afraid, stop over the limb immersed in tepid oil, or the limb immersed in Egyptian unguent, or in something of the like, so that when the ligaments are softened, and the bones are separated from their embrace, the traction is alleviated.</start_of_turn
More likely if it is a large bone such as the femur or tibia or the like, and what is corrupted is only the surface of it, then burn that out only as much as is necessary until that blackness and corruption has disappeared, and then restore the wound.</start_of_turn
More likely if what is corrupted is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and all that has been incised so that the corruption is not extended, and care for that until it is solidified.</start_of_turn
And I recommend that you ask a man in his bed to help you with this example and assistant in your operation.</start_of_turn
For a young man in his prime around xxx years of age, who has experienced pain in his heel, and from whose limbs maudlin blood flows profusely over the substance of the limb within which the substance is spread to the heel, and is a matter of great swelling, and not of an extrinsic cause.</start_of_turn
And thus it is necessary to extend the time for the error of the doctors until the swelling has subsided, and to reduce the matter of bone fragments, and their care should be paused until the wound has healed, and they should make incisions in all the painful places from which all the pains and humors of the body have disappeared.</start_of_turn
And thus many doctors have cured this in two years, and I have not heard of this until now.</start_of_turn
And I saw the wound of the limb and the matters that ran from it out of great pain; and already the color of that man was very pale and yellow.</start_of_turn
And thus I introduced my hand into one of those wounds and found the bone there.</start_of_turn
And thus I saw that they had all disappeared from all parts of the wound.</start_of_turn
And thus I shut myself in and made an incision in one of those wounds through which I extracted a piece of the bone, and I cauterized that corruption, and it was already black and corrupt and putrid; and part of the limb was already corrupted before I had penetrated it.</start_of_turn
And thus I followed what was prescribed and prepared by the master himself.
And I observed that it was not in the bone but that corruption which produced the swelling and pain, and I had already evacuated it.</end_of_turn>
Then I applied the restoration of the wound with supportive medicines for a long time, and it is not consolidated.</end_of_turn>
And thus I repeated the procedure and discovered further on the bone according to the first discovery, and there remained persistent corruption of the bone.</end_of_turn
And I observed that from that corruption there appeared to me a perforation to be made for the cure and restoration, and it is not restored.</end_of_turn>
And thus I discovered another ulcer which did not cease to bleed small fragments of bone until I perforated the restoration of the limb, and it was not restored until I extracted the marrow with my thumb, and I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated and healed.</end_of_turn>
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation of the limb and its section, but for the evacuation of the pus and for the rarity of the limb's tolerance and its fear of death, which it suffers at all hours from excessive evacuation without any benefit.</end_of_turn>
Therefore health is for the whole cure, and nothing is more useful than the evacuation of the pus in the belly; and it is good to restore the virtue of the limb; and it is conserved in its evacuations and does not cause it to become lame or painful in any way.</end_of_turn
More if the limb is prominent in the body already, the hour covers that you should do this in the following manner: that you take ligament and stretch that at the extremity of that prominent limb, and command that someone extend that in its entirety; and pull that ligament of wool thicker than the first ligament; and then lay that over the bone that you leave behind the limb, and stretch the limb so that you drive the bone to the parts behind, and you uncover the bone over the place you wish to close, so that the marrow does not become bruised.</end_of_turn
And leave fasting or a table behind so that the limb is properly descended, for when you do this the marrow is not prohibited from being squeezed out of the corrupted bone.</end_of_turn
And cover that the scraping of the diseased area is small by small, for if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption does not appear in its appearance to the feeling, and forces the closure of the other ulcer.</end_of_turn
And if the limb is corrupted and not prominent, the part that remains is continued with the other, and the corruption is at the middle or in part of it, the hour you uncover the bone throughout; and then leave fasting, and command that you stretch that which was the first part from which corruption arose until the closure of the other part is completed.</end_of_turn
And let the scraping be according to the location of the corruption a little, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And if the corruption is at the joint, incisions that joint that is corrupted, and scrape the bone where the other part is continued.</end_of_turn
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, the hour is not in proportion but ingenious.</end_of_turn
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is not easy; however, cover that you inquire about the corruption in what way it appears to you, and open that, and tell me what way you wish to handle it, and in what way you wish to correct it, when it does not make you contradict blood or nerves.</end_of_turn
And you know what is incisions and what instruments to use for incisions of these bones are not always according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and the size of them, and their smoothness and greatness and smallness, and their hardness and rarity; for you must prepare for every kind of operation the appropriate instruments for that operation.</end_of_turn
And you know that this operation means for you about the kind of instrument from which you will be guided; when in your case it is great study and long and with knowledge of the methods of this art, and testimony of the methods of treating diseases, for you already have them at your disposal for your medicine.</end_of_turn
And I tell you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will find among the simples with which you will perform your order that you will experience about the others.</end_of_turn The provided text does not contain any information regarding the specific tools mentioned in the document, so I am unable to extract the requested data from the given context.
Form of another remedy:
Form of another remedy: Great remedy.
The next sentence is: "When the disease has been banished by this remedy, a plaster should be applied to the limb." The plaster should be made in the shape of a star with a claw, and the points should be like those of a staple
And do not apply it until the joints are confirmed to be broken, or the mouth is greatly expanded
This remedy is less potent than the others
This remedy is lateral
When the remedy has been appropriately applied: make an arch with the thumb and index finger, and reduce the acute pain, and gently stretch the limb downwards Like this
Like the one that has been concaved
Like another subtle remedy
Like another remedy of curved extremity
Like a small tentacle-like remedy
Like another minor incision
Like another incision; this one is similar to a ray, and the limb is held in a claw-like position, and is shown in many locations in proportion to the bones:
Like a ray that is perforated through the bones:
And the limb is triangular and acute-angled
And it is made of Indian iron, and like all the causes that we have mentioned of raspings, incisions and knives.
Of incisions of the extremities and the closing of the bones.
The extremities are sometimes affected by an intrinsic cause or by an extrinsic cause, or when you have treated that corruption for the healing of those medicines and the healing does not relieve it, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the limb without you having treated it, when in that case you must instill that limb within the hon that accompanies the corruption, so that the illness is banished by that of death or by evil that is more harmful to the limb.
And the sign that this will happen is that the limb becomes black before it is healed, or that it grows pale towards black before the black has disappeared from that part of the limb that was affected by the corruption; therefore do not inscribe that limb in that case
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is a venomous bruise, such as from a scorpion, a fox or a spider, or something of that kind
If the corruption or the bruise is in the tip of the finger, then you must inscribe the finger and do not leave space for the corruption to enter the hand
Similarly, if you reach the hand, then you must inscribe that of the root of the nail, and do not leave space for the corruption to enter until it has disappeared from the nail of the arm
And if you do not do that, then inscribe the arm inside the fold at the joint
And if this should happen again, and sometimes the fold goes away, then in that case the illness is death; and to administer another cause along with this one is an excessive amount of virtue
Similarly, if the corruption affects the toe when it goes away from the finger, then you must inscribe that within one of the nails
And if it comes to the heel of the foot, then you must inscribe the whole foot Even if it goes into the nail, then you must inscribe the limb at the joint of the nail
And if the corruption has already spread over the nail, then do not attempt anything but dismissal, and let the illness take its course
And the manner of incising the limb or cutting it is that you grasp the ligament in the part beyond which you wish to inscribe, and grasp another ligament over the area; and extend the minister one ligament to the parts beyond, and extend the minister another ligament in their; and you separate the flesh that is between two ligaments without splitting them too much, until all the flesh has been discovered; and then inscribe or cut.
And cover that the patient's limbs are completely still so that they do not move the area, and that the patient receives the wound adjusted and then remove the cautery.
If blood flows forth carelessly during the work, then immediately cease the cautery at the site, or hold back the veins somewhat to constrict the blood; and then return to your remedy until completion.
And immediately bind the affected limb with a bandage or as convenient, and care for him until he is healed
I advise you that you should send a man to the foot of the patient, who is the cause of this unfortunate accident that I have mentioned and which you have recommended, for in the foot of the patient is an inflammation similar to the burning of fire.</end_of_turn>
That inflammation first occurs in the said foot until it affects the whole limb.</end_of_turn>
Then that man should prepare himself with more care than before, when he shall go to the limb with great pain and great swelling, and the patient must be given rest until the swelling subsides and the pain ceases.</end_of_turn>
For a long time that painful inflammation remains in the toes.</end_of_turn>
And thus I say, and so I must report that that uselessness that is on the hand of the physicians must be removed, so that the body of the patient is restored; and it does not remain useless but begins to depart from the hand as soon as it begins on the hand.</end_of_turn
And I ask you to order the hand to be cauterized, and I do not wish to do anything more in hope of the result of that uselessness, for I fear that it may bring about the death of the patient, since the power of the disease lies in its violent nature.</end_of_turn>
And when he awakens, let him return to his home and let me know that that man has prepared himself and cauterized his hand, and that he is healed.</end_of_turn
I have not recounted this tale for any other purpose than to be of service concerning this disease, and for the significance which it has and which is to be observed in its operation.</end_of_turn
Beware of physicians who lack skill and whose quality of care is lacking.</end_of_turn>
When an abscess bursts in a fleshy limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until the collection of pus has finished, and then it is broken and pierced, and the pus is discharged from it. The limb remains as if it were a vessel, and the surrounding tissue, which has been loosened by the abscess, is like a subtle thread, and it is not to be mistaken for a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption becomes established in some part of the limb, then it is called a fistula and not a simple abscess.</end_of_turn>
The treatment for such a fistula is that you should stretch out that surrounding tissue completely as if it were a wheel, and more so when it is thin and flexible, and comfort yourself that it does not adhere to the place of its corruption.</end_of_turn
However, if you hope that the surrounding tissue will adhere and that the corruption will not have further consequences, and if blood has clotted in the tissue, then you must care for that.</end_of_turn
And you must consider the safety of the patient, and if it is great, and if the limb that you see has a foul odor, then you must administer that Egyptian medicine which is made of olive oil, vinegar and lead, and which is given in doses equal to the parts of barley, and they are covered over the fire until the medicine is done and has reached its proper consistency.</end_of_turn>
Then take from it what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and cauterize that area, strengthen the edges of the wound, and leave the medicine on it for the space of two hours.</end_of_turn
And extract from it what is superfluous; and do this for many days until the limb is healed and the pain is gone.</end_of_turn
And some physicians cauterize with water of ashes, when it is not at your disposal this medicine; and you take the ash of vinegar, and put it on the wound; and thus you will know when the limb is finally healed.</end_of_turn
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of ashes, then you must cauterize with water and honey and mix in some zinc oxide, and also mix in some vinegar and honey, because honey has the property of softening and washing away, and vinegar has the property of adhering the limb, especially when there is excess of stickiness and dryness.</end_of_turn
And when you see some redness and swelling, and that the pain has already subsided, then clusterize that area which is causing the swelling.
Take some unguent diaphtharic and dissolve that oily pus; or clusterize that area with some medicinal unguents, and apply others which have the properties that I have already written about in the treatise on unguents.</end_of_turn>
If the orifice of the vein is strict in which the catheter is not received, then enlarge that area little by little, and stop when it is enveloped in Egyptian or basilic ointment.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the orifice is wide, then tighten the edges of the vein with sutures and leave as much space as is necessary for the catheter to pass through.</end_of_turn>
If the orifice from which the blood flows upwards is elevated to the surrounding parts, then dry that area under the limb which is above that in order that the limb may flow downwards, because when the limb is constricted in the curvature of the vein, the blood will be forced out of it.</end_of_turn
If it is not possible for you to dry out the limb within the surrounding parts as you wish, then you must perforate that area and prepare the limb with the preparation which is commonly used for it, and do not hold it back by any cause of the limb.</end_of_turn>
May he who is over the orifice of the vein which you have left behind, remain there for an hour so that it may heal from the pressure of the limb.</end_of_turn And that you may know whether the blood from the limb is moving or is sluggish, or is digested or undigested.</end_of_turn
And take into consideration the place of that vein, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is swollen.</end_of_turn
And when your medicine is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter which is clotted over the orifice of the vein has already adhered, or is improperly adherent, then you must remove it or do so three days later, and when you remove the scab, change the bandage for another and renew the ointment.</end_of_turn
May there be no harmful viruses near the vein, for the healing of the limb is proper, for in some homes there is a slow generation of pus in the wounds, and in others it is beneficial to oppose it.</end_of_turn
If the limb has remained swollen for a few days, the vein does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the vein is delayed and is the cause of the prolongation, then you must adjust with an excision of the medicine, and if the medicines are too moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are too dry as well as when they are applied too thickly.</end_of_turn
And it is better that after this the pain has ceased, that you take diaphtharic unguent and dissolve it in oily pus, and apply some ointment of vinegar to it in its substance, and so comfort that area, and use it.</end_of_turn
And thus it is seen in that action, when the limb is not present, that diaphtharic unguent, better when it is cold, should be taken until it is engrosed; or that you take mirra and aloes and incense, grind them all and powder them over the honey when it is lukewarm, and pour it over the wound and strengthen that over the vein; and pour over the honey that which has been ground until it is engrosed, and powder it over the wound and strengthen that.</end_of_turn
And various other medicines are administered with it, according to the long tradition and the wisdom of celestial lilies (which are celestial lilies), and barley flour and cocksfoot and centaury, and use either of these simples or adjust them, grind them and powder them over the honey which I have recommended; and use them.</end_of_turn
And if the limb is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, it is understood that the corruption is in the root of the limb, and already make inquiry in the bones or in the other members distant or to the ligaments; then you must treat with fistula treatment, as it is said above.</end_of_turn
From care of swelling and nails attracted, and incision of the finger added, and section.
Pannaris is swelling which does not leave the nail of the finger protruding from the hand or foot, and which is strong in the other fingers, and when it is prolonged its care is more expensive, or is spontaneous swelling, or is corrupted, and it emits a stench until it corrodes the root of the nail, and is strongly corrupted throughout, and is strongly prone to corruption at the bone within which it is located, and has a fetid odor.
And therefore when you see that which we have said in the division and you do not confirm your care, the hour covers that you completely cauterize all the superfluousness that is softened by the nail and immediately cauterize the plaque immediately because the cautery is not useful in this case.
If indeed the bone is soft and the nail is sound, and the affections of the nail are already departing from the cartilages, and are beginning to puncture and bruise them, the hour covers that you leave aside the angle of the nail which is biting the flesh, and push back the same with your hand and cut that flesh with ease, and leave over only what remains of the flesh from the medicines that burn away the corrosive parts until it is all gone; and immediately care for that which remains inside that it should be sound.
If the corruption has already spread in the bone, the hour covers that you extract the bone and remove it, for no time is it sound for the bone to be corrupted.
And if sometimes the corruption and the corruption go down to the finger, the hour covers that you make an incision in one of the nails as it is foreseen in the reminder, and immediately care for that which remains inside that it should be sound.
If the nail has percussion or swelling, and there is acute pain, the hour covers that you immediately apply cold compresses to the patient, and immediately dry the nail with rough sponges or transverse cuts without causing damage to the nail, and keep it that the cut does not reach the flesh that is left under the nail, because you will make the acute pain worse, and the cause of the adjusted surplus of flesh in the area. And immediately care for that area where the pain persists.
The adjusted surplus, which is natural in most households, is strong in meat, and is strong in bones, or is strong in the nails.
The cause of these is the root of the joint, or is the cause of these in the bones of the fingers The one which is caused in the bones of the fingers does not worsen, but the one which is caused in the joints is more harmful.
And of those which are caused by meat, the cut is slight, and is that you make an incision at the root with the tip of the scissors
And of those which are caused by the root of the joint, the care is difficult; and therefore take care of the amputation of it.
If in those where you must cut the nails, cover that you make the incision at the beginning of the flesh surrounding the bone to the bone, and immediately grasp with one of those convenient saws, and immediately care for that which remains inside that it should be sound
But consolidation which happens in these fingers between their soft tissues or by the birth of the fetus that does not depart, or by consolidation of pus or by burning of fire, or by habit, in which case you must cover that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And immediately stop between their cloths covered in oil so that they do not adhere too firmly, and separate between them, or place between them a layer of lead foil until it is consolidated as much as necessary.
And in the same way if consolidation happens in the bones of the palm, the hour covers that you dry that consolidation according to the custom and convene it to the shape of the limb
From the cutting of vices, so are varices.
Vices are varices, and these are veins which are covered with thick veins full of black bile which are found in the bones of the body, and their greatest movement is in the limbs, and most of all in the limbs of travelers and laborers and porters.
Therefore you must administer purgatives of the body of black bile several times with forceful expulsion, and immediately bleed the patient from the basilica vein
And the care of them is in two ways: one is that it is incision and that you cauterize that black stain, and the other way is that you elevate the vein and extract it entirely.
The incision is done in this way: with the thumb of the hand supporting the limb at the beginning, so that the thick black stain is dissolved, which is fruitful of the limb, and then tighten the limb of the patient to the upper part of the cushion with a bandage, and immediately dry the vein in one place, or in two, or in three at a wide incision, and immediately elevate the black stain to the navel with the thumb of the other hand, and pull it out, until the amount that you want has been extracted, and that which will tolerate the virtue of the disease.
And so say that, and command them to abstain from foods that cause black bile.
Repeat the treatment for phlegmometry when the veins are swollen and the patient complains of pain.
The elevation of the limb should be done as follows: you stretch the limb of the patient, if there is movement in it, and then put it in water and bandage the limb with warm water until it turns red and the veins become engorged; or that it be performed by exercise, if the water is not at your disposal, until the limb is scorched.
And so cut the vein at the root or at its neck, or at its lower part you must give it support, or in the lowest part you must do the same.
And so open the vein with scissors and scrape the vein throughout until bleeding appears, and it is necessary to see that the bleeding stops when the pain disappears.
And so avoid the white that remains of the vein thus.
Then put your hand over the bleeding so that it is elevated and bound up from the vein, and suspend that until the bleeding stops.
And so cut another section near that section for three fingers, and so scrape the vein from the part below the vein until bleeding appears.
And so elevate that and pierce that in the lower section you must give it support, and so extract that and elevate that until it is healed by the second section, and so extract that from the section above that
And do that until you have extracted that from the section that is lowest or highest of all the sections, until all is healed; and then pierce that again
And if you do not obey my order to extract and elevate, then put in a strong double needle and ligate that and extract it, or put your hand over the bleeding and rotate your hand over the whole area until it is bound up Beware that it is not pierced; for if it is fractured, it is difficult to elevate that limb and it is harmful to the patient for that night.
When all the bleeding has ceased, then pause over the place of the wound and soak in wine and olive oil and unrefined olive oil, and care for that until it is healed.
If the vein is contracted having spasms at the parts where it is bound, and it is not according to the rules as we have said, then you must cover that you have opened over the whole extent of the spasms of the limb and the parts where it is bound, and then suspend that until that whole thing is elevated
Beware that you must not pierce the vein and do not touch that, for it is difficult to elevate that limb; and use your prudence in that matter.
The text provided does not contain any information regarding the formation of an incident involving a dry vein, so I am unable to provide a translation for this section.
It is not urgent like that with scissors or of immediate extremity for that it does not harm the vein; and it has great flexibility like a lion, for if it were slight, it would fracture the vein by its slightness; having great thickness in it as we have said.
Extraction of the thigh vein.
This vein originates in the buttocks as well as in the Arabian lands and in the dry lands of India where there is little vegetation and little rain.
And it is also engendered in other parts of the body besides the buttocks.
Its origin is from corruption that comes from leaving the vein as well as from bites of serpents and worms and bites of lice and worms that are engendered between the vein and the flesh.
The sign of the coming of this disease is when the vein is inflamed in the limb; and in that place swelling appears; and from the place of that swelling the vein begins to dry up like that which appears to be caused by the root of a plant
And thus when the limb appears, cover that part with a plum whose weight is equal to two drachmas. Enter two drachmas, and notice that and leave the plum suspended from the limb.</end_of_turn>
And so many times as there are causes for those things outside, cover that with a cushion and do not touch that If it is not prolonged, then you will insert a portion of it [the diseased part] and cover it; do not insert that which is contracted within, for if you insert that which is contracted and enters the bone, it will cause swelling and ulceration.
Because it must be treated gently and gradually extracted, until it is completely expelled from behind and does not leave any residue in the body.
And from this vein is extracted in its entirety as many as there are fingers of one hand, and it has already reached me that there has been extracted one of twenty palms.</end_of_turn>
And if it is inserted at the time of its treatment, then immediately put a ray into the cavity of the limb and perforate that which is long along the limb of the body, until everything that is in the matter is evacuated, and give putrefaction of the limb for several days with medicines; and take care of that for the healing of the abscess.</end_of_turn>
And this vein has various veins, and more so when it appears at the ankle or on the foot, and it comes out of almost every orifice of the limb.
And therefore take care of that as we have said in the division and as regards what has been said above.</end_of_turn>
From the section above comes the worms generated under the skin and is called bovine fever.</end_of_turn>
This disease is called in every land bovine fever because it comes out in the veins of the beasts and is very dangerous, for it goes throughout the whole body, damaging and weakening everything, and is shown by the suffering of the patient from pain in each limb until the bone is fractured and comes out.</end_of_turn
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of various humors as well as the worms and snakes and worms and lice in the belly.</end_of_turn
And it is feared for its malice, for when it enters the body and is elevated to the head, it reaches the brain, and when it enters, it breaks and destroys the brain, and that is what causes the veins to swell.</end_of_turn
And therefore when you want to cure it and extract it, you must not do so without seeing its walking and apparent movement, and when you see it, cover what is above it and what is left of it with a bandage, and tighten it firmly, and then dry it and extract it.</end_of_turn
And if it is pressing on the bone and you do not remove it, immediately put a cautery over the area until it remains there, and the greatest cause of fear is the corruption of it as we have said.</end_of_turn
May it sometimes happen that the ailment has reached the head near the brain, then tighten over the brow with great stricture, and dry it over it, and extract it; and let the patient use a purgative medicine to evacuate foul humors, and guard against foods that generate putrefaction.</end_of_turn
From the section above comes the swelling of the abscess.</end_of_turn
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is the pain which is seen in all the limbs, and it is usually confused from limb to limb.</end_of_turn
And I have already seen that which I will tell you to recommend.</end> I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I saw her arm swollen, and I saw a small swelling in the funis vein of the arm, and when I left for an hour, I saw that swelling had gone away just as quickly as it had appeared, as if it had never been there.
And then I went away from the pain of that place and remained in the muscle, and I stayed there for an hour.
And then I went to the other limb until I reached the other arm.</end_of_turn
And then I recommended to her that she should rotate her body throughout the whole limb as I saw; and I was too amazed at the transformation and the speed of limb to limb.</end_of_turn And I had already seen it before in my days in that way, but I have seen many others who suffer from pain that is transformed from limb to limb.</end_of_turn But I have not seen anything like that in the girls.</end_of_turn>
And I do not think that it is anything but that the woman was of great age, and she had many old bones and veins exposed, and in this appearance there was a sensation of that rapid transformation.</end_of_turn
It is necessary that it does not appear according to this retrograde procedure in those who are delicate and have humors of veins that are thickened.
As you wish concerning the treatment of these people who have that pain, and when the patient sits there with that pain, do not be afraid to touch them as we have said, but rather strengthen yourself over that area and leave them calmed down until that congestion has gone away, and then cauterize the area.</end_of_turn>
Perhaps if you do not see the thighs swollen, when you treat that which is the excess of the body and what expels the congestion, sing them with those who are pallid and those who are pale, and let them appear like little pills of bile and little pills of saffron.</end_of_turn
From the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their species and according to the places of the body in which they are cast, because their diversity is that of those that have large heads and small, concave, and blunt, so that they are solid; and of those that have three angles, and of those that have tongues; and of those that have bars.</end_of_turn>
And concerning the throats of the servants is when they cast in the arrow and it passes through them, and is situated over the brain which is about the size of an egg, because of which accidents happen to them of vomiting violently, and sneezing, and dizziness, and hiccups in the belly, and inflammation and hiccup of the tongue, and spasm and mixture of sense and vomiting of bile, and great heat is produced by the breaking of the word and the destruction of the voice, and it is situated in the place of the wound a white moisture resembling clots, and it looks like the consistency of blood.</end_of_turn
And therefore if you see this throat, the hour you abstain from the treatment and from the extraction of the arrow, if not outside.</end_of_turn>
More are the throats of the arrow when it is cast in the heart, so that it is at the left breast, and sits on that which is the cause of hardness, and is not a cause of voidance; and when the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the guts, and runs from the wound black soot, and if anyone has suffered from the coldness of the extremities, and excessive sweating, and fainting; and therefore you must know that death descends immediately.</end_of_turn
And the throats when the arrow has lodged in the lung are thus: they are immediately filled with black spots of the plague, and the veins that are next to the gut are burst, and the color of the sickness is changed, and great spirit is exhaled, and demands fresh air.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow is cast in the membrane that is in the feet, and the pain is thus: it is proper of the small bones, and it is useful to remove it with great vomiting and great pain, and do not move all the muscles of the limbs.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow is cast in the stomach, the hour great heat comes from the plague running through it.
And if the arrow is cast in the belly, and is lodged there, comes great wound of the plague, or the membrane, or the intestine which is burst, and there is no hope of the treatment of its extraction.</end_of_turn>
And if the arrow is cast in the bladder, and comes out with urine, and proceeds from it any cause to the outside, and there is great pain over the sickness, the hour you must know that it is fatal.</end_of_turn
And as for the rest of the limbs, thus also the face, the head, the throat, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, the ribs, the collarbone, the shoulder blades, and the arms and their limbs, are saved according to the greatest provisions when the arrow does not find a vein or an artery and is not a venomous arrow.</end_of_turn
And I recommend to you what I have seen of the being of these arrows, for that it signifies concerning the treatment of your illness.</end_of_turn>
The cause of which is that in a man who was shot with an arrow in the tear of his eye in the root of his nose, and I extracted that from the other side, left him with the gray of the eyebrow, and he is healed, and did not suffer in his eye afterwards.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a soldier who had been struck in the groin area, leaving the wound open, and the arrow was already hidden so that it was not possible to retrieve it except for a small fragment that adhered to the thigh, and it was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with gold in the head.
And thus is the soldier, and not at all injured in the groin area
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who had been struck in the groin, and it was an Arabian arrow, and there were pearls on it; and when I had made an incision between two ribs, and it was already submerged in the groin of the patient; and I was discreet with that, and I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in the belly, and I thought he would die from that; and when three days had passed and there had been no improvement in his condition, I made an incision on the arrow and pulled it out, and he was healed, and there was no further injury to him
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had been struck in two places, and consolidated is the swelling over them, and when I approached him to set him at ease, he died immediately, and the arrow was extracted from the root of the thigh
And I saw a woman who had been struck by an arrow in the belly, and the swelling was consolidated around it, and it was not altered by her natural processes, and the woman did not suffer any further from her natural operations.
And I saw another man who had been struck by an arrow in the face, and the swelling was consolidated and the arrow was broken, without any further pain, and he seemed to recover from that condition.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who had been struck in the middle of his nose, and it had already declined to the black bile a little, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to care for him shortly after the arrow was extracted within three days.
And then I stopped the swelling of the arrow wound without any stretching; and then I inquired about the sensation of pain, and he did not feel any; more he felt a tingling sensation left by the tip of the arrow, and I hoped that that tingling sensation was due to the extremity of the arrow.
And I applied to the place a plaster which has an adhesive and digestive virtue, trusting that the part will return to its normal position because of the action of that plaster on the arrow wound, because it dries up over that.
And there was no significant injury to the part except that caused by the arrow; and I continued to keep the plaster on it for several days and there was no further injury; and the swelling was consolidated and the patient recovered from the pain of the arrow wound within a few days, since on the following day he could feel the arrow no longer in his nose and he confirmed that to me
And then I discontinued the acute corrosive plaster for several days until I saw an improvement, and when I tried it I found that the tip of the arrow adhered to the thigh.
And then I replaced the plaster with this new medicine until I saw the tip of the arrow visibly, and I left it like that for some time, for about four months
And when the swelling had increased, I thought it would be possible to remove the forceps from it, and I did so, and did not observe any further pain; however, I did not cease to be discreet and skillful in my handling of that area, until one day, when I was handling it in the way I had learned, I managed to extract the arrow; and then I restored the wound
And some doctors say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored; and I restored that and the swelling was consolidated, and the patient was completely healed, and I do not remember any further occurrence of that kind of suffering
I recommend to you the quality of extracting any arrow, for you should pause and explain clearly what is not mentioned in this narrative, since the parts of this art and the definitions of this do not agree with the narration or with your free understanding
And wise artists compare little with great things; and in what is present there is something absent; and they find new operations and new instruments which descend from the causes outside the art when an accident occurs
Therefore I say that arrows are not expelled from the limbs in which they are placed except in two ways: either by attraction of the place where they are pierced; or on the contrary, by the other side
The pain that arises from the area where the bones meet, or from the inward of the flesh, is expelled and driven out.
If you do not obey the time of the catgut, the hour commands that you leave it lying for a few days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and that its attraction and discharge be relieved.</end_of_turn>
Similarly, if it is stuck in bone and you do not obey the time, the hour leaves it lying for a few days and iterates with its attraction and movement in every day, and it is expelled.</end_of_turn>
If you do not obey your time within a few days, the hour commands that you perforate in the course of the arrow in that bone from its entirety until the bone is made flexible by the arrow, and then extract it.</end_of_turn
Maybe if the arrow has already disappeared in the body of the limb, and is hidden from the feeling, the hour asks you to inquire about it, and if you find it, the hour pulls it out with those instruments that are convenient for the attraction of it.</end_of_turn>
And if you cannot do it because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here neither bone nor nerve nor vein, the hour advises you to wait for the plague to be amplified until it is possible to extract the arrow.</end_of_turn
And if you have other things which you consider, which are urgent, the hour recommends that you break the flesh in which it is stuck entirely with all the skill you can; and think about it, if you cannot do better than evacuate the flesh from the fracture of the ankles and the twisting of those until you obey.</end_of_turn
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any place, the hour uses with all its force at all times to make that work; and whisper that the arrow is not fractured and that it is easily attracted and extracted.</end_of_turn
And if you cannot do that of your hour, the hour leaves it lying for a few days until the parts that are around it have healed, and then iterates that the hour is relieved.</end_of_turn Maybe if you do something contrary to the flow of custom, the hour recommends that you administer what has been said about care in the head.</end_of_turn
And preserve your vigilance from the beginning of the vein or nerve, or string, and administer instruments in every way possible to facilitate the evacuation of the arrow; and do it with ease, tranquility, delay and firmness as I have said and you have recommended.</end_of_turn
Therefore make the arrow go out contrary to its figure so that the illness is in accordance with the figure according to which you must order the evacuation of the arrow, which is more helpful.</end_of_turn Maybe if that is not possible for you, the hour recommends that you do what is possible for you according to the figures.</end_of_turn
Maybe the arrows which are expelled contrary to the other side, or which already proceed from one side to the other, or make the transmission of the arrow difficult because of the sensation of the side which is below the hip bone and sometimes that eminent; then you must abstain from that; and let the incision be according to the quantity in which the forceps grasp; and then pull it out, because it is lighter at this time.</end_of_turn
Maybe if it is retained in the bone, the hour recommends that you twist the limb contrary to the custom until the arrow presses against the bone, and expand it halfway, and then extract it.</end_of_turn
Or leave it lying for a few days, and then repeat that until it heals.</end_of_turn>
And if the head of the arrow is in that place, the hour recommends that you pierce that with it.</end_of_turn
May it be that if the fever has subsided and you wish to administer an impulse, then insert your finger and, if it is numb, stir cautiously so that between the concavity of the thumb and the heel you may impel that which is in it.
If the thumb is concave, then insert your finger forcefully so that the thumb is relieved by that.
And if the thumb is poisoned, then you must cover the entire area where the pain is with your hand, if you can, and then care for that which you suspect
And if the thumb hurts in the foot, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close to causing you to touch that area, then touch that with your finger and if possible drain that, for it will prevent infection of the vein or nerve, and extract that, and then compress that until it has healed.
Form of forceps with which the thumbs are grasped:
Their extremities are like the beak of a sparrow, which are firm like a saw when they grasp the thumb so that it does not slip away
And these are various forms of forceps, large, small, medium and small, according to the quantity of the greatness of the thumb and its scarcity, and of the breadth of the wound, and of the constriction of it.
like this so that the inside of the thumb which is concave is relieved and is driven out by that
Of the flebotomy of the veins.
The veins which are usually flebotomized are those of the foot, hand, belly and chest of which there are sixteen in total There are two pulse veins which are close to the ankles, which are called the palpebral veins; two veins which are in the two temporal regions which appear; two veins which are in two tear ducts of two holes which are called the lacrimal veins; the vein which is prepared in the middle of the face, and the vein which is in the extremity of the nose; two veins which are in the cheek; two veins which are in the lower lip; two veins which are in the upper lip; and these are the veins which are called the palpebral; and there are two veins which are in the tongue But the veins which are flebotomized in the limbs are worth five for in those there is a cephalic vein, which is blind, and is called the “head vein”, which is a minor vein, which is composed of a branch of the basilica and another branch of the cephalic; and people call that “the vein of the whole body”, and the basilica vein is stopped in the domestic lap, and is called “citellar”, and they call those which are in the belly “belly veins”; and the funis of the arm, which is stopped over the elbow, and is that in which flebotomy is performed, and that appears on the heel for its manifestation; and the great saphenous vein, which is between the thumb and the little finger, and there are two branches in it
And in the foot and the thigh there are three veins; one of which is that which is beyond the curvature of the heel of the outside; and the second is the saphenous, the place of which is beyond the thigh of the outside; and the sciatic vein, the place of which is beyond the thigh of the outside; and in the thigh there are other veins similar to those.
The support of the veins which are close to the ankles is for catarrh of the ancient times and emigration and safra and ulcers of the head of bad ancient times
And the quality of bleeding these is as I recommend to you: that the head of the patient should be calm and the head of the patient in the occipital region where both veins are somewhat wide and have good friction; to strengthen the patient's head let him hold his chin with two fingers placed two finger-breadths below the head; and if you feel that two fingers are enough to hold it, here you will hold the hand.
Take your needle lance, which is the one that is incisions, and insert that which is left of the vein in the bone so that the flebotomy comes out to the bone. And elevate your hand to the vein and the bone to the sides and then you will puncture the vein at the incision point. The length of the incision should be equal to twice the width of two fingers, and do as much as you wish; and thus you will perform the operation safely.
Then withdraw the powder and leave only that which has healed.</end_of_turn>
And thus the incision of those and their cautery are completed.</end_of_turn>
More than two veins or arteries which are at the temples help to prevent inflammation is an old emigration and is bad and excessive vomiting and abundance of acute effusions in the heel.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the inflammation of those is as I recommend to you: constrict the patient's abdomen until two veins appear to be visible in the sentiment of their appearance and when they are shown to be present; and when you are certain, then do what you desire.</end_of_turn
Then elevate the limb above the vein towards the buttocks as I have indicated, and introduce the inflammation into the body through the incision, and elevate the vein again; and make the incision in the same way as you did with the other two veins; and do as much as you wish of the operation.</end_of_turn
Then remove the covering of the patient, and rest your hand on the vein for an hour, and then rest over the wound and the powder and tighten that which is under your hand, and leave only that which has healed.</end_of_turn
And thus the memory of those things is completed, and the incision, and the attraction at the beginning of the operation.</end_of_turn
And thus the benefit of the inflammation of the vein of the forehead is similar to the inflammation of the cephalic vein to the ancient illnesses of the face and emigration and swelling and ulcers that are fetid.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the inflammation of those is as I recommend to you; so that the patient grasps the abdomen with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take an instrument which is called forceps of which this is the form.</end_of_turn
Pause the puncture at the tip of the forceps over that vein and perforate it either forward or backward in the manner of the hand; and leave the wound to run as much as you wish; and then remove the perforation of the abdomen and tighten that which has healed.</end_of_turn
Many veins are opened with the inflammation, but do not think that the inflammation is of acute extremity as well as the others; for it is of remote extremity, and the inflammation is in proportion to the breadth of the os which is proper and firm in it when the inflammation is subtle.</end_of_turn
More useful are the two veins which are at the corners of two heels for scabbing of the heel for swelling and swelling in the heel, and for the illnesses of the face.</end_of_turn
The quality of the inflammation is that the patient grasps the abdomen with a bandage, and immediately perform the inflammation of those things, and you remain standing over their head.</end_of_turn
And thus the inflammation is successful according to the proportion of the length to the breadth of the inflammation, for in the place there is no bone; and if the inflammation is subtle, the limb is firm and the os is fractured.</end_of_turn
Then do as much as you wish of the operation, and rest over those wounds, and tighten those for a night, and then remove them.</end_of_turn
More than the inflammation of the vein of the nose is with acute fever and violent vomiting, and with the illnesses of the face and emigration and swelling that occur in the face, and more when it is ancient.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the inflammation of those is that the patient grasps the abdomen and take hold of the nose with your left hand, and perform the inflammation slowly and leave it in the middle of the face according to the direction of the ruler, for the vein does not appear in this place, and the blood begins to flow freely.</end_of_turn
Cover that the inflammation is done little by little and gradually let the blood run according to your need; and leave that for a night, for that is restored pleasantly.</end_of_turn
More useful is the inflammation of the two guide veins to constriction of ale and to the beginning of leprosy and to spots of illness and itching and corrosive ulcers just as herpotromen.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the inflammation of those is that the patient grasps something from the abdomen with his limbs; and let the artifiacts be over the head of the patient, and let the patient be sitting on a cushion.</end_of_turn
E aprop fleubotoma la vena al lonc am fleubotomi ample petit a petit; e aprop extratz de sanc segon temprada quantitat o segon aquo que vezes de necessitat que es ad aquo; e aprop fay semblant del autra vena.
Then remove the ligature and tighten the two veins near the midpoint to prevent further bleeding, and leave the bandage inside until the wound has healed.
And in the treatment of phlebitis of the great veins, compare small apostemas and pustules of the mouth, corruption of the teeth, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and in the throat area.</end_of_turn>
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these is that it should cease the pain immediately, tighten the neck of the vein with a bandage, and then rotate the lips of the vein and ligate two veins, one from the right lip and the other from the left lip; and the sign of which is the blackness of either of them, and more especially when the two veins are black in the circuit of these.
If there is any doubt, you may leave it to the incision of the greater of these, and the sign that will manifest itself from these.
And make them resemble the two veins that are in the lips above.</end_of_turn>
More useful than ligating two veins that are left in the tongue is the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein to prevent affections that are in the gullet, to the disease of the uvula, and to diseases of the mouth.</end_of_turn>
The quality of phlebotomizing these is that it should follow the pain between your teeth right away, elevate the tongue, and restrain the tongue, from one side of the vein and from the other side of the vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.</end_of_turn
And so phlebotomize each; and take care that you do not touch the vein with your hand, for you may leave them as arteries.</end_of_turn
And these veins which are phlebotomized in the groin are those in which blood usually runs in all men, and the phlebotomy of these is useful in two ways, or by making a small puncture of the skin with a needle or by making a small incision with a lancet; or by pressing on the puncture with the thumb and index finger, and this is the way to do it.</end_of_turn
Both thumbs and index fingers are to be used as many times as necessary, and you must open the veins that appear flattened and contain a large amount of blood.
This phlebotomy is of smaller breadth and more subtle, and is suitable for phlebotomy of small veins that contain subtle blood clots.</end_of_turn
More useful is the phlebotomy of the basilica vein which is one of the three veins: which extract the blood of the affections that are left in the gullet and the neck, and of what is left of the legs and the belly.</end_of_turn
It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomizes that, to guard well and be cautious in that, because if he does not, he may leave the artery open, and if he is mistaken in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will puncture that artery and blood will flow, so that you must avoid that by cutting as little as possible.</end_of_turn
And if the basilica does not appear to be obvious, then you must leave that one and move to the other, or that you seek any branch whatever; or that you phlebotomize in place of it at the end of the arm, which is also obvious; and cut that one with the phlebotomy as well as we have said.</end_of_turn
More if you wish to perform the phlebotomy of the median nerve, then you must precede by guarding the stricture of the arm that touches the area inside where you begin the area of the forearm; and then put on a bandage over that; and then tie the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with the phlebotomy as we have said; and take care that the percussion does not extend to the space of the artery.</end_of_turn
When you stretch the ligament, an inflammation occurs in the place that you have marked, for that inflammation is of the artery, and therefore it swells up.
When sometimes the blood flows in the swelling like urine of a child, and the blood is thick like barley, know that it is the blood of the artery; and when you see that the swelling has extended for a long distance, stop the hand that you have placed over that area; and if the blood is split, that is to say if there are clots, remove them; for if the blood is split, the hand which you have stretched will leave it behind.</end_of_turn>
Beware the patient from the discharge of their urine, and do not fear them for a few days until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if the blood is not split, and sometimes even if you do not wish it, you must pierce the artery if it appears to you; for the limb will be contracted, and the blood will be split; or that you take a short fist, and do so, and take a little powder and stretch that over the place of the vein which is strictured with the ligament and the pulp within to the other day.</end_of_turn
And if the blood is split, it is not good; otherwise, keep that which preceded the recollection of the place of the split veins flowing blood.</end_of_turn
The split of the blood of the limb is difficult in masses of blood due to the smallness of the wound and the possibility of the ligament of the arm.</end_of_turn>
More of the veins are useful for draining blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for they are composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And cover the phlebotomist who is over-anxious in the phlebotomy of the limb, for that one is a nerve; and when you touch the puncture of the phlebotomy and find the nerve, you will cause him to faint, and it is difficult for him to recover, and he will not be completely healed. And this nerve is visible in some people and is thin and not visible; so cover that the phlebotomist does not prick the nerve with his sharpness.</end_of_turn
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you must cut the vein lengthwise.</end_of_turn
The advantage of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws out the blood of the head and relieves the evils of the heels.</end_of_turn
And take care of this in this way, if you want the phlebotomist to prick with the phlebotomy olive oil or with the phlebotomy myrtle; for this is the best remedy for all the veins, for it is not to prick the artery or the nerve.</end_of_turn
However, it is often seen in some people that when it is not phlebotomized in the first percussion, it is not noticed afterwards.</end_of_turn
It must be known that phlebotomy is not administered except in the conservation of health and in the hope of health and caution in the event of the occurrence of diseases, and that it is useful phlebotomy in one of the veins that is in the groin, that is to say: cephalic, femoral and basilica; and that it is useful phlebotomy at the beginning of spring, after breakfast in the spring and in the autumn, and in winter almost with food, when there is a significant sign of replenishment.</end_of_turn
And it is useful to phlebotomize every three days or at most once a day after three hours have passed.</end_of_turn
Phlebotomy that is administered must cause convenience and necessity in this, or at night or day, in all hours and at all times.</end_of_turn
And it must be known that children should not be phlebotomized until they are thirteen years old, and women should not be phlebotomized except after the fourth month of the seventh month, and old people should not be phlebotomized who have already passed their eightieth year.</end_of_turn
And when someone wants to be phlebotomized for any reason, it must be modified by placing a sponge over the belly before the phlebotomy, if there is a clot retained in it, so that the veins are not injured by the surplus of blood that is pushed out, and that they do not cause damage to the principal members.</end_of_turn
E non sia mai sospetto ai pazienti naucea sacertiva e crapula, né fugiat malathia né ebretatem usque quando iste fiat remanugut iste de lor, né malathia de i dropici, ma più che la fleubotomia sia temuta aprop colica passio et aprop vomit, et aprop cos de ventre, et aprop multiplicacio de coyt e de trebal e d’esercici de dejunis o de vigilias e de quanta causa Dissolve y restore la virtute, o sia corpore28 o animali.
And consider carefully the composition of the humors before healing, if it is appropriate with foods and drinks, and with medicines if possible.
And in this way, if no other cause hinders, or if excited by any exercise, so that the healing be subtle
And suspend the vomiting in their feet at the third hour, as we have said before
And order that the feet of that person be guarded on that day in all kinds of adversity, as in case of distress, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, as well as in case of work, excessive grief, and thirst, and other similar things.
And let there be present with her the causes which usually accompany men, such as aromaticness, odor, fat, and resemblance to those according to the quantity of possibility
And follow the phlebotomist over a cushion that is thicker than the cushion of that which must be phlebotomized.
Then draw out their arms, and cool the hand of the phlebotomist with two or three wicks; and tighten the ligature with a cord and encircle with two wicks.
And the constraint should be temperate, because the excessive constraint, when not equal, hinders the flow of the healing; or is too great, for it hinders the course of the healing.
And when the constraint is over, let the one who is to be phlebotomized cool their hands between their thighs until the veins are swollen, and declare it to the feeling.
And let the phlebotomist take a little oil from the patient with his left hand immediately; and stop the patient’s hand by indicating his left hand over that vein from which the phlebotomy is to be performed, so that the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is calmed because it is the vein that has escaped that is causing the phlebotomy, and that is full of air, and when the phlebotomist places his hand over that one, it is contracted by the phlebotomy, and is discerned by the phlebotomist; and the phlebotomy does not open the vein, and if it does open, that one is stretched.
Therefore, in order that the phlebotomist be stopped and is requested in all these cases.
And so suspend the phlebotomy, even if the vein is broken in a wick, for it is not good; or if so, repeat it another time and leave that place a little, or feed it if the place is not relaxed.
And if the place is relaxed, or the disease is scattered, leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature, for it may cause excessive bleeding, or do not enter the bath
And repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the healing is proceeding well, and you fear that the amount that you want to recover will not be enough, then repeat the phlebotomy in that place according to custom and adjust a little in the opening, and do so until the place is relaxed, for the place is relaxed in many people in case of little opening
And even if sometimes that is relaxed, do not repeat over it, for it is not useful to you in any way; and suspend over that every part of the wound of the oil, for it relieves the course of the healing.</end_turn> It is better in this place than oil and the others oils.</end_turn>
And in like manner administer oil to the wound in all phlebotomies from which the veins are escaping due to the prohibition of the course of healing, and make it thick like porridge and slimy when it is stopped from one of those on the place, for the healing is subtle and is reversed when it is thick.
And if in the place of the phlebotomy great swelling is engendered, which several wicks have caused, especially if it has not bled except that wick, or in the little opening of the vein, then you should cover it and suspend over that place a sponge soaked in water and salt, a little scraped off, and press that for an hour, for it is dissolved.</end_turn
And cover that area with a sheet or blanket in accordance with the location of the vein or another vein.
If you remain in the place for a few days, any black or green swelling will not be noticed; and if you wish, stop any cause of pain, such as aloes or myrrh dissolved in vinegar, or any cause of spasm of the mind or of cramps or something similar to these.</end_of_turn>
The veins are well-bled away, after which abscesses and swellings must be removed by incision of the basilica.</end_of_turn>
Therefore place your hand over that area, and if you find it to be painful, put your compression over that area, for that swelling is harmful and bad; and now keep your hand over that any cause of that which we have said, because a strong flow of blood comes from the main artery.</end_of_turn
And cover with something that is adhesive to the area where the bleeding stops, so that the place becomes firm, and then take care of the other care that is necessary to make it healthy.</end_of_turn
And extract from the vein all the blood according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the blood remaining in the vein according to how it appears.</end_of_turn>
For if the vein is black, then leave it to rot until it is well-healed; and in the same way if you see it large, leave it to rot until it is delicate; and in the same way if it is acute, until the acuteness is gone.</end_of_turn
And cover whoever is full and strong and has need of an extraction of a vein in a hurry, that the incision of the vein be increased and that the bleeding be copious.</end_of_turn
And in the case of a woman, do the opposite of that, and cover that she should be extracted in small numbers, and that her wound should be slight.</end_of_turn
The best thing in the bleeding of a vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.</end_of_turn
This method of bleeding is safe from the flow of blood and from the injury of nerves, and is more useful and safer than bleeding by width and length.</end_of_turn
And to which it is customary to happen without fainting, do the bleeding; and cover that you cure that beforehand by applying a little piece of bread soaked in wine instead of a thousand grains or of simple salt; and extract from the vein three times or four.</end_of_turn
And if it is a cold complexion, cover that beforehand by applying vinegar of myrrh or vinegar of honey aromatic with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or in aromatic vinegar and fragrant.</end_of_turn
And if fainting happens, do the bleeding; and this is a cause of its sudden loss of blood; cover that you should precede by drinking lukewarm water and aromatic vinegar; and use of aromatic herbs and be sure to tie the limbs together with that.</end_of_turn
And use the other causes that we have mentioned in the division on fainting for evacuation.</end_of_turn
And whoever wants to make the evacuation of the blood more effective and dissolve the blood according to its quantity, cover that from which bleeding is for the most part, and the virtue of that is cold, which evacuates the blood little by little, so as to do according to the quantity of the virtue in the continuous days.</end_of_turn
Whoever wants to make the evacuation of the blood more effective, and to keep the blood strong, do that for the seventh or ninth time from the first bleeding.</end_of_turn
Whoever wants to withdraw the blood from the body contrary to the part from which it descends, cover that it should be done on the second or third day.</end_of_turn
Whoever in that body in which there is already blood clotted and is acute and causes the fever, cover that the blood should be bled out once and a great amount should be bled out, and that the perception be increased until fainting occurs, because you have preserved all the conditions of bleeding; and that you place your hand over the pulse of the body, because if you do not do this, death may occur instead of fainting, because sometimes the bledder is ignorant and negligent.</end_of_turn
And do not cover when you want to loosen the arms and evacuate the blood according to the quantity, as the orifice of the vein is closed and it is difficult to stop the bleeding, that you prefer that over that intensity and extend your hand widely, because that is too bad.</end_of_turn
Leave it until it is bled according to the method; or remain with the intensity of the bleeding that is clotting of the blood in the orifice of the vein; or place your hand over that of tyriaca alfarach, or of sage, and compress that until the blood is out and gone.</end_of_turn
If the vein is clotted, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the clot has dissolved.
If it is necessary to evacuate the abscess according to the rules, and this is not an excuse, then leave that abscess on that limb or in the other arm in another vein.
The vein called "funis brachiatus" is easily clotted in the place of the lymph or the fatty tissue, when it is not obstructed or hidden, which is composed of these things
The quality of the phlebotomy of these people is that the patient puts their hand in cold water until the pain disappears and the vein appears clearly
Then strengthen the limb with a tight ligature around the middle; and perform the phlebotomy according to the small transverse, not horizontally or along the length.
And let the opening be wide and your phlebotomy be on the part of the hand just below the wrist
And if the flow of the abscess is prohibited, then repeat the hand in cold water and let the abscess flow into the water until you have achieved your purpose
Maybe if you were in the summer days, then you would be excused from the repetition of the hand in cold water, and the more so when the body of the abscess is in cold water in winter.
The phlebotomy of this vein is more safe than that of all the others, for there is neither a pulsating vein nor nerves in it
The phlebotomy of the wrist is related to the diseases of the foot
The quality of the phlebotomy of these people is that you strengthen the limb with a tight ligature or with your hand, since you have placed it in cold water, until the vein is swollen and is clearly visible; and then perform the phlebotomy on the transverse; and if you prick it in this way it does not cause any pain in return
And keep that you do not touch your hand with the phlebotomy, for it leaves the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
And repeat the hand in cold water and let the abscess run in it, for if you do not repeat it in cold water, the abscess will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and this is prohibited from flowing
When the abscess is extracted according to the quantity of need, then leave the vein covered with oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too much; and immediately cover that you have made a complete wound
More useful is the phlebotomy of the left hand, as it is related to the diseases of the heel.
And do the same thing in the phlebotomy of these people as you did in the other one.
The advantage of the phlebotomy of the median vein is for the diseases that are in the lower part of the body, as well as for major diseases, such as retention of menstruation, and the diseases of the veins and ulcers of the buttocks and old wounds, and the like of these
The quality of the phlebotomy of these people is that the patient puts the whole foot into cold water and makes over that friction until the veins appear; and leaves over the wrist joint with the vein appearing from under the skin, and the part of the vein that is seen outside must be grasped by the thumb and the four fingers of the hand.
Therefore, phlebotomy is better with a wide opening or by leaving the limb over the ankle rather than by causing the accumulation of blood in the limb which is more harmful and salty
If you phlebotomize on the face of the foot, then you must take care of the nerves that are left over on the face of the foot, and stop your phlebotomy at the level where you phlebotomize, as if you were going to prick it
And so be it.
If it is prohibited to drain the abscess; then repeat the foot in cold water and let the abscess run in it until it is evacuated
If the phlebotomist makes a mistake in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little later, because the limb is salty; and do not be afraid of it, but take care of the nerves as we have said
And do the same thing with the other foot in the same way
As for the sciatic vein, the part as we have said is over the heel of the heel bone.
The benefit of flebotomy in such cases is to do it when the cause is known to be from caut.
The quality of the flebotomy is that the patient groans in pain, contracts and tightens the flesh of his belly up to the navel, and keeps it pressed down by four fingers on a long strap, which does not appear except in such cases.</end_of_turn>
And therefore, when it appears, do the flebotomy according to each case, as to the vessel, and it is better; or insert it by incision or extract it by incision, because the location is outside.</end_of_turn>
And it is in most men more hidden; and if you find it and it does not appear to the feeling of all, do the flebotomy of some branch of it, and that is the one that appears in the two of the foot between the heel and the ankle.</end_of_turn
Beware of the nerves, and make the incision run smoothly as much as you wish.</end_of_turn>
Then remove the stricture and place your hand over the area of the flebotomy to keep it firm, because it is healing.
From the instructions and qualities of its use.</end_of_turn>
Winds are of corn, or of hemp, or of ivy.</end_of_turn>
And the wind is useful in two ways: the one is by sacrifice and extraction of blood, and the other is by incision.</end_of_turn
And this incision that is by sacrifice is done in two ways, either by fire or by knife.</end_of_turn>
And to the winds that are administered with sacrifice and extraction of blood are fourteen parts of the body, of which one in which winds are stopped is the ankle; and the middle part of the thigh; and winds from the mouth go beyond the jaw; and winds of two spatulas; and winds of alohoster, which is over the heel; and winds of two flames; and winds of two bras; and winds of two cavities; and winds of two nails.</end_of_turn
And the wound does not extract blood from the great veins scattered throughout the flesh, and for this it does not possess the power for these; just as is the case with flebotomy; neither does it suffice that the incision should be made by fire or by knife in any disease that is not cured by the evacuation of all the blood from the body.</end_of_turn
Maybe if necessary we will cause an incision for disease or for continuing, let us administer it at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle and at any time.</end_of_turn
And therefore, when in any case of these, and properly when it is in the third or half of the month, it is commanded that the wound should be made more beneficial than it was passed over two or three hours ago.</end_of_turn
The benefit of the incision of the nape is that when this confers gravity to the head and to the belly; more than that, it is that it is almost the evacuation of all the body.</end_of_turn
And this incision is in the place of the cephalic flebotomy.</end_of_turn>
It is not proper that it should be used by anyone who is fatigued or in whom is catarr, because it gives great harm to that.</end_of_turn
And because of this it does not suffice that it should be used by the old, and in the heads of those in whom there are feverish diseases.</end_of_turn
More than that, if on that one should continue with it, it is beneficial to forget; and for this it is commanded that you order the cauturer to stop his hand a little with the vein at the edges, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.</end_of_turn
And the incision of alochohel is in the place of the flebotomy of the jugular and of the basilica: and for this it confers to spasm, and to the constriction of bile and to the scissura of the suffering of bile, and to coughs, and to repletion.</end_of_turn
The wind that proceeds from the alekel, if it is stopped, generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
The exhalation of vinegar causes headaches, ophthalmia, diarrhea, and toothache; it is in place of the quibble of the bile.</end_of_turn>
And let the exhaler keep his hand away from the scarification so that he does not wound the artery and cause blood to flow excessively.</end_of_turn>
The exhalation causes nausea in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and remains of the diseases that are in the mouth; it is in place of the purging of the bile that is in the two lips.</end_of_turn>
Better is the exhalation that is made over the two spatulas than that which is made over the head, which is useful for replacing heat.</end_of_turn
The exhalation from the armpits brings relief from the phlebotomy of three veins, that is, of the basilica, jugular and cephalic, for those that accompany the blood from all those veins that are more abundant in the body, and those smaller veins that are among the larger ones until they reach the attraction of the three veins.</end_of_turn
And command the exhaler not to proceed too much with the scarification, for the location is denuded of flesh, and leave the nerves and arteries.</end_of_turn
And it is a wind that is exhaled over the cushions and causes hemorrhoids in the buttocks and ulcers afterwards.</end_of_turn
And let the exhaler take a great breath, and that it be from the chest, for the location digests of great heat; and take away the slight exhalations and perform the scarification with a scarification.</end_of_turn
Better are the great winds from the armpits rather than the small ones, for they bring blood to all the body, and relieve ancient pains of the coughs and of the belly, and of the bladder; and they cause the menses, and relieve swelling and pain; and they are in place of the purging of two large veins, and of the vomiting, and of two cavities.</end>
However, do not let them do all this throughout the body, for it makes the pulse accelerate in many people.</end_of_turn>
And the exhalations from the armpits bring relief that is proportional to the relief of the winds of two armpits.</end_of_turn
The quality of the position of the winds is that it stops the initial exhalation and lets out a temperate exhalation, and do not prolong the position of the winds, but rather pause them leisurely, and remain in them moderately, and that the humors arrive at the location immediately to follow.</end_of_turn And do not cease this until you see the location already shrink and swell and that the color of the blood returns.</end_of_turn
And when you have finished the scarification, repeat the exhalation slowly and gradually, and pay attention to the condition of the body.</end_of_turn
For a person who has tender flesh of rare pores, command that you do him a single scarification and no more, for the location is not to be ulcerated.</end_of_turn
And command the exhaler to expand the scarification a a moderate degree and breathe slowly, and do not hold your breath.</end_of_turn
And if there is thickness in the blood, then command that you make two incisions, for in the first incision open the way for the subtiliation of the blood and the moisture of it.</end_of_turn Better is the second to the piercing of the extraction of the thick blood.</end_of_turn
And if the blood is not thick, then command that you make a third incision so that you can achieve the fourth degree.</end_of_turn
And finally, when you wish to extract the blood slowly or a little, suffice with a single scarification.</end_of_turn
And if you wish to extract a lot of blood, make several incisions; and if you know that the blood is thick, then command that you make a transverse incision.</end_of_turn
And the end of the incisions is only the depth of the groove.</end_of_turn
And if that from which the groove is large, hard, tough, and has narrow pores, command that the locations of the incisions be oiled with gentler unguents, resolving; if it is in summer, thus as olive oil of aloes or oil of violets, or oil of rosemary buds, or almond oil; and if it is in winter, then oil of nutmeg, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or of alum.</end_of_turn
If the excess is great, hot, then let it be applied with marigold, or balsam oil, or aloes oil, or anise oil, and so forth.
If the wind is strong from wide fields of barley, then let it be forbidden to apply oil, and let instead the parts of the wind be washed with vinegar or cold water of the sun, or with water of lilies, or with water of meadows, and so on.
And as for him from whom the moisture is excessive, wash his windings with wine vinegar, or with water of myrtle, sumac, and so on like those.</end_of_turn>
And as for him from whom the excess is great, wash his windings with strong vinegar, or with water of rue, which is elderberry, or of decoction of anise, or of chamomile, and so on like those.</end_of_turn>
And let the wind be kept away from the bath; having said that, let it be administered alongside the bath for an hour or two, and let it rest alongside the bath.</end_of_turn
What is it that is useful to return the wind from a phlebotomy before the wound?
Let us consider at the outset: if the wind or the one who must perform the phlebotomy is coleric and has a wound over him acute and inflamed, then let us anticipate frigid causes, such as many vinegar and lettuce, and sage, and fennel, and chamomile, and so on like those.</end_of_turn>
And abstain from foods such as poultry, fatty meats, and foods seasoned with vinegar, and the like.</end_of_turn
And as for him from whom the complexion is hot, let us anticipate the use of cold baths, or of cold decoction of sage seed, sumac, and fragrant herbs between wool and linen; and let him be recommended to drink little and eat sparingly, and abstain from poultry, meat, fish, eggs, almonds, and cabbage.</end_of_turn
And let the drinks be greater in the day of the wind and phlebotomy than the food.</end_of_turn
And let him be given in drinking water in several hours before breakfast, or medicine of musk, such as muskroot, or alum, before or alongside the wind or phlebotomy or alongside, so that the principal parts are comforted and the wound is soothed; and let them not take vinegar or wine.</end_of_turn
And the winds which are harmful are those which irritate the chest, and the foot, and the navel, in the joints, and the scrotum, because these members suffer from no sacrifice.</end_of_turn
And it is not desired for those except for the attraction of the wound of a member, as when a wind is held over a wound of the body in a disease of excessive flow of humors from the head; and they use it so that the cold wind is dissolved from the member, as when it is held over the belly and the navel; because thereby the member is softened and the pain that resolves the cold wind is removed.</end_of_turn
And it is already said concerning the hiccups when they happen together with vomiting, because by their attraction a strong wind is produced which evacuates vomiting from its place.</end_of_turn
Similarly, when it is held over the chest and the foot, it expels the cold wind in those closed spaces.</end_of_turn>
These winds are administered cold with vinegar only; and some are administered with fire.</end_of_turn
And some are administered full of cold water in the diseases of the foot.</end_of_turn
And this is because the wind must be full and great, so it is cold water alone or cold water in which appropriate herbs are boiled.</end_of_turn>
Form of wind administered with fire: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of resin is that of a palm; and let it be placed on the flank, in the place where it is in the circuit, as much as it can hold, the neck be small according to the quantity that enters it with a needle.</end_of_turn
Let there be applied vinegar or lemon, marigolds, laurel, ginger and ivy for so that it does not make the member move from its place over it.</end_of_turn
And let there be placed between the thumb and the little finger a sponge or iron, where a candle is held with the fire.</end_of_turn
And let this wind be much greater than the one we have recommended; and let little be taken of that according to the diseases and the condition of the one who uses it.</end_of_turn
The winds of the elderly are more widespread than those of the young and of robust bodies.
The quality of placing this wind on the limb is that it extends the flame towards the wood with a slight touch of candle wax, and place that above the middle of the transverse vein in the middle area of the wind, so that the flame is kindled around the edge, so that it does not burn the body of the patient.</end_of_turn>
And so it should be kept on the limb of the patient, and it is said that when we have said these things, when we have the winds and do not order that they stop and that the vapor escapes from that wound, the wind will be so dispersed.</end_of_turn>
And so we light the flame according to its custom, and repeat that if you order it thus.</end_of_turn>
More in the wind that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse vein or wound, and is not administered except that it be full of water, and is placed on the limb alone.</end_of_turn>
And this is the way: And this wind, the more it is great, the better, because it receives a great quantity of water.</end_of_turn
(The text ends here)</end_of_turn>
Blood does not flow in all limbs, but only in those in which the position of the wind is not possible due to their small size, thus as with the thumb and little finger; or in limb denuded of flesh, as it is said of the nose and nails, and in such cases.</end_of_turn
And the quality of using those which you have found in the deep waters of poppy flowers.</end_of_turn
And so they should be left lying down day and night in deep water until they are faint, and that no cause remain in their belly; and that you evacuate the body at the beginning with a phlebotomy and with winds; and that you cool the limb until it turns red; and that you place them over it.</end_of_turn
And thus they are full and cases.</end_of_turn
And if it is possible to extract the area from the wind, it is better later in treatment.</end_of_turn
And if not, the hours wash the area with cold water and add a little more; and keep it cool and squeezed.</end_of_turn
And if the duration of the treatment is prolonged, add to the case of bloodletting, and when that is done, put on a cold pack in the water, and place that on it until the discharge is finished.</end_of_turn
And if the disease is multiplied, the hours sprinkle over it powdered vitriol, or urine and it resembles the causes of stagnation, until the disease is expelled; or that you place over the area the masses of scraped honeycombs, and that you leave them until the honeycombs adhere to the area, and the disease is expelled.</end_of_turn
And if necessary, repeat the bloodletting, when possible change those.</end_of_turn
And if bloodletting is prohibited, the hours keep the limb fresh or leave a needle in the area until the disease has gone away; and so they are placed, so that when any disease should happen again it is supported.</end_of_turn
And when you want to close, sprinkle over those a little barley flour or salt, or ash, and close tightly.</end_of_turn
Thus ends the procedure of the third part: restoration.</end_of_turn> This chapter is very useful necessary in the art of medicine; and is the restoration of fracture and dislocation of bones.</end_of_turn
Oh, son, wise men, listen to me! The fools of doctors, the vulgarians, and those who at some time do not remember the ancients or do not read their books.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is useful that this manner of science on our land is private; and I have not forgotten it at any time in my life; and I have not omitted anything from it, except for the length of reading the works of the ancients and studying to understand them, until I have extracted the science from them.</end_of_turn
And so I direct to experiment and study throughout my life.</end_of_turn
And I have already described in this chapter all that concerns my science and about which I have experimented; since I have abbreviated it from you others and released you from the burden of lengthening; and I have opened it at the end of abbreviation; and I have shown you at the end of the declaration; and I have formed in you various forms of the ailments that are administered in this way, as it is done in addition to the declaration, as I have done in the two preceding chapters.</end>
First chapter.
Summary and collection of this fracture of the bones, from which it is necessary to make a preliminary statement before we proceed to the description of the fractured limbs and their various conditions. Therefore, let us speak in the preface of this chapter of the sums of the speech; and the chapters to understand of which in the beginning is forced to learn the artifices and to be fixed on the truth of those things; so you and those who know or learn this noble art from you.
Therefore I say that when an accident occurs to a fracture or dislocation or twist or casement, it is necessary to start immediately with bleeding or to apply a bandage, or whatever, if you do not prevent any cause, even if it be with the greatest virtue, or if it be an infant, or an old person in decrepitude, or if it be a time of great heat or of great cold.
And so be content in food with fresh herbs and fish and crab; and prohibit large meats and fill them out with foods and all food that fills the veins of health, within that you are sure of the after-effect of the cautery, and if you do not fear the effusion of matter from the limb.</end_of_turn>
And so return the patient to their first position as they usually do.
Therefore when the bone is being restored, it is necessary that the patient be given nourishing and nutritious food that is not too thick and difficult to digest, such as porridge made with flour and water, broth, eggs, fish, beef, almonds, and peas, and in this regimen there is a coagulation of the fracture that is more tenacious and lasting.</end_of_turn
And you must know that bones break when they are in the homes that are in the first youth and in the decrepit, it is not possible that they should continue and be consolidated according to their nature except for the dehydration of the limbs.</end_of_turn>
More importantly, however, nature adjusts and remembers that the fractured bone of any kind that remains swollen and tense adheres to that which adheres to it until it is congealed and united together, until the end of inflammation and convalescence, as fire is at the beginning, until any cause does not prevent it from doing its work.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is necessary to rest the food of the patient, food that is heavy and viscous and large, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And you must know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limb, for example the fracture of the bone of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the forearm; and similarly all the others are diverse among them.</end_of_turn
And I shall return with a reminder of all the species of fracture, which are explained in the different chapters of this book.</end_of_turn>
Many different fractures in general.</end_of_turn And they are diversified the species of fracture of the bone in their metaphysis; for example, a fractured bone in its star is different from one that occurs in its marrow; and a fractured bone is different from a fractured bone according to its length: and the fractures of the tibia and fibula are caused both by traumatic and untraumatic factors, just as it is in writing when it is prepared to be written, and is a fractured bone with plaque and disruption in the head, and is a slight fracture.
And for each species there is a peculiar remedy or treatment in the restoration of the limb as will be reminded in the different places.</end_of_turn
Sign of fracture of the bone.</end_of_turn And for this it is known that a fracture of the bone: there is stiffness of the limb, and swelling and prominence of the limb to the touch, and pain when pressure is applied to it with the hand.</end_of_turn
Therefore when there is no apparent stiffness or when it is not believed to be present, do not touch the bone with your hand, for the patient does not experience great pain in that case.</end_of_turn
There is also possible that it is a slight stiffness or a small fracture, in which case you must not touch it with your hand or compress it; there must be rest from the medicines of which you have been reminded at that moment when it is convenient; and take care to avoid strangulation.</end_of_turn
The pain that arises when the joints are affected by cold humors, which infiltrate every part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, is commonly called gout by physicians.
If the swelling persists after the cautery treatment, let it rest for a few days until the swelling subsides; and in the meantime, apply any means that can lift and suspend the limb.
It is better to restore and elevate the limb than to fracture the bone in which the discomfort originates.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, remember this case for future reference.</start_of_turn>
If the limb is fractured in the bone, it is necessary to extend the limb in two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or hold it with your hand if the limb is small; or bind it with two strings or one string and the hand.</start_of_turn>
And keep the limb in the position in which it naturally rests, while the fractured parts are extended, for in this way you will prevent them from becoming swollen and causing further discomfort.</start_of_turn
Be careful not to cause additional pain or injury to the patient during the treatment of the pain; and use the amount of force that is necessary to effectively perform the operation.
Take advantage of this opportunity to touch the patient's hand at that moment, and if there is any other cause, rectify it and suspend it to the extent of your ability.</start_of_turn
Avoid excessive extension and compression, just as wise doctors do when performing cautery treatment, for this can cause swelling in the limb.</start_of_turn
The quality of the limb's traction is that which you will recommend; for you know that fractured limbs are diverse in size and shape.</start_of_turn
And as for those that are small, such as the arm, the finger, and the toe, it is necessary to wrap them with a soft bandage.</start_of_turn
As for those that are large, such as the thigh or the forearm, it is necessary to wrap them with a firm bandage, which will securely connect the large parts to the small parts with the engagement of the surrounding tissue.</start_of_turn
And finally, start by evacuating the fracture, and then apply appropriate traction to the limb with three or four bandages as necessary; and hold the limb firmly with your hand.</start_of_turn
Observe the most elevated part of the fracture location, and tighten the traction more than necessary to ensure the stability of the fractured area.</start_of_turn And gradually lengthen the bandage over the fracture location, and soften the traction gradually until a large part of the limb has been recovered.</start_of_turn
And take another bandage and cover the other bandage over the fractured part with the previous bandage; and see that the bandages are placed at a distance from the fracture; and that your treatment is in the traction and softening of the bandage as we have said concerning the first bandage.</start_of_turn
And if there is still discomfort in the limb, stop between the stops of the lion or leopard that supports the fracture, if there is discomfort; but if not, do not stop for any reason.</start_of_turn
And stop again on the other side, and gently wrap over these bandages that are properly placed without causing swelling or cautery-induced swelling; and leave it for a few days; and in the meantime strengthen the surrounding area.</start_of_turn
E sian las stelhas de la maytat de canna lada raza, e be formada saviament; o sian de fust de pi; o de ramps de palma; e sia le ample de quascuna stelha segon aquesta forma e aquesta figura.
But that the staple which is placed over that fracture be bigger and wider than the others, and the length of the staple according to the size of the limb and its magnitude; and strengthen over the staple with another object as per your first instruction; and bind tightly as we have said above, that is, as much as the fracture is distant, and as much as it is prolonged.
And that the threads be of medium thickness and flexibility, and be of linen; and if the threads are coarse, thus also I have seen in the operation of alcus fols that they are taken out during the stitching of the wound, which is a great error, when they leave the stricture unequal.
And subtle threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve a secure hold of the stricture with those that you wish; and do not cover that between two staples there should be less than a finger.
And if the patient is suffering from the edges of the staples, then immediately suspend the tightening in those places until they cause no further injury.
Some wounds of fracture are like a wound, and an accident of disruption in the cord, and I remind you of this in the chapter concerning singularity.
And know that every fractured limb is not straight from the first day; the cause of which is that when the limb is large, it does not suffice to rest on the staples but to wait a few days or more, according to your security of the advancement of healing of the cautery
This is the manner in which the ancients restored the plaster which was placed over fracture, dislocation and twist.
Plastering method like that of restoring a fracture, convenient for multiple complex fractures and especially for women and men, because it is of that from which no heat nor cold arises: and take powder of wheat flour, which is the middle of the wheat that hangs over the germ of the wheat.
And comfort him thus if you can, but if there is an album of blood, stop the flow of it so that it does not thicken or become viscous; and use of that.</start_of_turn>
Another manner of plastering for fractures, dislocations and twists: recipe of asafetida, lapdanum, acacia, enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of licorice, five grains of myrrh and five grains of aloes; aloes twenty grains. All of these are crushed and sifted and mixed with water, either with oil or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this plaster, which is of good composition and restores the broken bones pleasantly, and gives confidence to many men.</end_of_turn>
Another manner of plastering for which comfort is given for fracture and twist: recipe marigold and white alum at a rate of ten grains; myrrh and aloes at five grains; acacia five grains; linseed oil two grains. Twenty grains of vinegar.</end_of_turn
All these are crushed in a mortar with a rough stone, and are powdered, and are moistened with water or blood and is administered.</start_of_turn
Plastering method for joints and separated bones in their place, and for pains caused by fractures and breaks: take fine linen thread and immerse it in vinegar and oil and place it over the area.</start_of_turn
Note that this plaster is not of benefit for restoration, for cautery and expels pain properly.</start_of_turn
Another method of plastering that restores the fracture: take the leaves of fig tree out and the leaves of poppy seed saved; contain everything and make plaster of them.</start_of_turn

And I have never seen anyone do this, for it is more reasonable that it does not happen.
Chapter two: On fracture when it occurs in the head
The varieties of fractures are many, and their figures are diverse, and their causes are diverse, for every fracture is caused by impact of space, and the impact hinders all the bone within the cavity, which is left in its place, just as happens in the forearm; and for this reason this kind is called spiral; or the space impacts any part of the bone, and impacts the marrow and does not pass through the back of the bone; and this kind of fracture is called elevation absolute.
And the plague of these two fractures is great or small, and of a fracture that is contracted or retracted; and the cause of these is impact with the palm of the hand or by falling onto stone, and their symptoms resemble each other.</end_of_turn>
And this fracture is penetrating, which has already approached the nerve which is left in the bone; or it is in the face of the bone, and the plague of these two fractures is great or small.</end_of_turn>
And a fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the small groove of the bone, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called capillary.</end_of_turn
And a fracture is caused by impact or by falling or by impact of stone, and its symptoms are that any layer of the bone enters the surrounding parts, and it is caused in the hollow part just as happens to the fingernails when they are impacted and some of them enter the surrounding parts.</end_of_turn
And most frequently it is caused in the bones of humous substances, just as in the heads of nails.</end_of_turn
And all these mentioned fractures are traumatic, just as separated stars.</end_of_turn> And I come to regret all this.</end_of_turn
And I know all these kinds of fractures by detection on those which are open and for inquiry of their extent and in order to determine whether there is corrupted bone over them.</end_of_turn
And the capillary fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and it is excised, and the surrounding area is tented, so that the fracture appears black.</end_of_turn
Moreover, in the treatment of fracture, one must take into consideration at the outset the signs of illness, and when sometimes for the signs that signify importance appear, such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, fever, and sudden loss of consciousness and rigor of these symptoms, despite all this, if the patient does not recover.</end_of_turn>
And sometimes when non-progressive accidents appear, you hope for health, and when you begin the treatment of them.</end_of_turn
The cause of which is that if it is provoked at the beginning like that which is provoked in the days of spring, it covers that you study in the bone marrow up to the fourteenth day according to all the rules.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the summer days, it covers that you must rest the bone from the seventh day, having left the bone marrow exposed, so that the bone becomes corrupted from the nerve, and that these accidents that we have recommended take place.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has already reached the nerve covering the cerebellum, and is contracted and retracted, it covers that you should insert the contracted part and retract it, as I have recommended to you.</end_of_turn
And that you take his head of the illness, and discover about the bone as is usually done and handle it as you are able according to the figure of the illness, and that you are curious about the illness.</end_of_turn
And if it happens to you, you must oppose the detection of the bone, flux of ointment or cautery, and what covers it, and that you cover the place with soft cloths soaked in wine and oil, and make the wound rest until the swelling subsides; and be sure to drain the flux of ointment. And start from the circumference of the bone and from the incision.</end_of_turn
And this is according to two methods of operation.</end_of_turn
And one method is that you insert the bone with a straight incision, and this is the form: And you administer another incision slightly wider than the first; and this is the form:
And you administer more of the wider incision than the first.</end_of_turn
And it is proper that you declare your name as an inscriber, for some of them are more lax than others; and some of them are more brief than the others and stand at the rear of their sharpness, and they are of iron or wicked.
And use of them is facilitated in their percussion on the inscribers so that they do not bruise the head and injure them.</end_of_turn>
And if the bone is strong, hard, then cover that you perforate around it giving that you administer the inscribers at their travels, which are named superficial not profound.</end_of_turn>
And they are not called thus except when those who do not stop the term of the bone until it is close to it so that at the superficial part or margin of that which is left is left the head of it appearing like a margin or a small circle, which hinders it from being submerged and passing through the toughness of the bone.</end_of_turn
And it is convenient that you take a great number of these superficial marks of which some may please the toughness of each bone, except in all tests of the cranium where the extremity is acute, the quantity in length and breadth is according to the quantity of toughness of this test.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of three species of superficial marks: The quality of perforating in the circuit of the fractured bone is that you pause the mark on the bone and rotate it with the thumbs saying that the bone is already perforated; and then change the perforation to another place and stop when there is between all the quantity of the thickness of the ray or send it away.</end_of_turn
And in addition to the inscription of the inscribers between each fracture of the bone, do that which is more subtle than to do over that in order to avoid lifting, as we have said, until you have eradicated the bone, or with your hand, or by any other cause for some tremors which appear over that, as for example, nails and fine forceps.</end_of_turn
And be sure that the inscriber does not touch any cause of the hernia.</end_of_turn>
And therefore when you have perforated the bone and if it is continued with it, and if you take that out, be sure that you raise and expel that which is in the roughness of it from that which is in the bone like another inscriber, but indeed that it be more tender and subtle than the others.</end_of_turn
And if any small parts of the bones and fragments remain, then take that out easily with that which is due to you from the pangs; and indeed take care of the wound with liniment and ointment which we have mentioned.</end_of_turn
And another manner of operation is light, long, which says dissect Gualia and laze for great relief; and this is the word for it: it is necessary for you at the beginning to discover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is the most acute and obvious, until when you have discovered that part and you have stopped leaving that extremity of that inscriber slowly and joyfully of which this is the form:
And that the blunt part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is of it in two directions forward and backward, as sometimes; that the blunt part be adjusted to the hernia with the face of the acute inscription on the bone.</end_of_turn
And indeed pierce upon the inscriber with a little hammer so that you inscribe all the bone easily as it is rotated, and you will be sure of the accuracy that it does not happen by chance that the physician is the most fool of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was sleeping.</end_of_turn
And if there remains any attached cause to the bone in various places of the bone, inscribe that at the extremity of the inscriber that is blunt, and expel that which is at ease; that is delayed of it spontaneously and by fear.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate inside the hernia, and that which is broken or remains of the bone is the face of it, and remains in it roughness and subtle fragments, then be sure that you raise that roughness and expel those fragments with subtle reasons for which you have prepared the number, of various quantities so that it is possible for you to manage them in all places with the greatest convenience and the greatest safety of those according to which you have lost your operation that fractured bone and its figure.</end_of_turn
And be sure that you manage in your reason the quantity of the bones at the beginning of those reasons, and indeed use almost all of the soft parts of it, and do not cease until you have finished administering the greatest and the most subtle of all those.</end_of_turn
Indeed in any other small fractures capillaries and subtle fracture, be sure to manage carefully according to what you have lost to rectify it.</end_of_turn
It is because it is not known to anyone who has studied that art. And so we have learned from the great fractures that...
If the swelling is rectangular when you radiate it from the bone, then take an amount of lint corresponding to the amount of the swelling, soak it in oil of ravens, and place it over the wound; and take another lint doubled or tripled and soak it in wine and oil of ravens and place it over the first one, and do so until the pus comes out readily from the wound without causing damage; and then apply on it some lint of lint and do not tighten it except as much as the swelling itself.
And leave it like this for a day or two until you are sure that the wound has healed; and then remove it and administer medicines that are appropriate for such cases, such as flaxseed and oatmeal, and powdered gentian and aloe, and similar things to these.
And it is that you must sprinkle these medicines finely over the swelling; and generally, administer any medicine that has the property of stopping and not killing.
Observe with your wisdom that the swelling in your treatment should be neither too little nor too much; neither should you irritate it with oil or any other substance; and do not add any venom to it, for when it is applied to the bone it corrupts it and brings about the death of the patient, and brings about evil to the patient.
And it is necessary to take into account in the fracture of the head, as it is more difficult to heal the bone and especially when the treatment is negligent, and is black on the surface; and therefore consider that if such an accident befalls the patient, it is dangerous in every way
And if no blackening has occurred except from the medicine that is being used, and it is because of that medicine that this blackening has occurred, then take a little more of the medicine and three parts of oil of ravens and mix with these the mentioned balsam, and place it on the fracture; and do so until it is healed
Chapter III.
On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Observe that the nose is not fractured but rather that two larger portions have been separated from each other, or one of them is somewhat softened, so that there are two bones remaining, for the separated part is cartilaginous and is not fractured but is rather soft and flexible and susceptible to bruising
If indeed one of the two parts is fractured, then you must insert a little bit into the nose at the site of the fracture, and stabilize that fracture by means of the tape called indicator and the cushion, until the nose returns to its natural shape And do so easily, and keep in mind that you should not cause him any pain during this operation on the patient's pain
If the fracture is in the soft part of the nose, and you say that it is not necessary, then keep it equal to the width of the ray in which the thickness is small
And if the fracture is in two parts, do the same for it as for the other
Close up the restoration of the nose on the first day of the fracture, if possible; otherwise, leave it for six days or until you have seen signs of healing
And insert into the extremity of the nose a bandage of lint, if the fracture is in one part, or two cushions, if the fracture is in two parts, and the thickness of the cushion should be such that it fills the cavity of the nose
Tell the old restorers that the cushions must be bound in border, and must be changed throughout the day, although you are not told to me; because it must be covered with an albumin of egg with powdered lead.
And there are some who say that instead of a cushion they will put honey into the nose, because it is more enveloping of the bone than the lint; and that when the nose is fractured the patient is not prohibited from inspiration
This is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do so, and if you wish, do not do so.
And if another remedy has happened post-caut, plaster the nose with cheese or with lead soaked in wine and oil of ravens, or with vinegar.
Although it has not happened post-caut, nevertheless you must plaster the outside with barley flour and powdered gentian mixed with egg white; and put over it a layer of lead, and do not touch the nose for any reason whatsoever
May it be that if the bones of the nose are fractured in a slight or great degree, that you split over those [fractures], and extract those with instruments that are appropriate to those; and then close the wound, and care for that which has been rent in and consolidated, and with appropriate plasters.
And if there be pus in the nose, then care for that which is scaly and administer lead canulas until it is completely healed.</end_of_turn>

Of restoration of the mandible when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
When the mandible is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by pus, it is necessary to determine if the fracture is displaced only, and not fractured in two and bent outwards. In this case, the knowledge of the fracture is slight.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and in the same way if the fracture is on the left mandible, insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with that the swelling of the fracture outwards, with your other hand on the outward part of the bone; thus you will equal that side.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then care must be taken to administer extension of two parts according to the rectitude until it is possible to equal them.</end_of_turn
And if there be displacement of teeth with fracture, then strengthen those which you expect to remain with gold or silver or ivory; and place a cerate over the fractured mandible, and place over it a bandage of gut or silk, and a pad over the large hip bone adequately placed; and tie that which is displaced according to what is appropriate for the ligature of that and convenient for the application, until it is not destroyed.</end_of_turn
Command the patient to rest and tranquility, and abstain from eating spicy foods.</end_of_turn
And if you find that the figure has already been altered in any way, then you must cover yourself and remove that on the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered in it and plaster that with powdered gypsum, glue of hog, or oatmeal, because you have left them without support, and place over the plaster bandage of linen.</end_of_turn
And now when it is fixed and adjusted that plaster over it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave that for a while, that is, do not remove it until it is healed and the fracture is strengthened; for as many wounds as are left open will grow stiff in three months.</end_of_turn
And if another wound occurs afterwards, care must be taken of that which has been said of open wounds until it is healed, and remove that aftercare.</end>
And if the fracture is accompanied by pus, consider if it is a broken bone or a swelling, because in this case you must order the removal of those swellings in order to remove those which cause discomfort.</end_of_turn>
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, care must be taken to widen it with the flebotome according to the quantity of your need.</end_of_turn
And when you have removed those swellings, and of those you do not remove them, care must be taken to close the wound if it is wide; otherwise, place over that one of the plasters which is convenient and consolidate that.</end_of_turn
Chapter V.</end_of_turn
Of restoration of the thyroid when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
A wound is called fractured when the thyroid is fractured from the front towards the back of the muscle, and that fracture is caused in three ways.</end_of_turn
For it is fractured, or separated, or is separated into two parts without causing swellings; and it is difficult to restore it; or it is accompanied by swellings, and is difficult to restore it; or the fracture is accompanied by pus.</end_of_turn
And the operation in that is that two assistants are present, one to support and follow the fractured thyroid, and the other to extend the collar towards that part.</end_of_turn
Then wrap the fracture with the index fingers of both hands until the shape is restored according to what you consider, neither too taut nor too concave.</end_of_turn
And if you need more extension, care must be taken to suspend the patient's breath by holding his breath or by applying a bandage to his mouth; and the degree of this must be according to the quantity of your need; and extend and elevate the thyroid and cover the wound with your hand until you have secured the fracture as you consider appropriate.</end_of_turn
If the wrist cannot be drawn out beyond the joints, so that it reaches the preon, then cover that the patient's head should be supine and rest a cushion on their muscle.
The minister should support the limb beyond the joints until the wrist bone has been elevated to the preon, and then rectify the fracture and bind the parts together.</end_of_turn>
If you feel the wrist bones dislocated and swollen, cover that area and extract those fragments with ease.</end_of_turn>
And if the fracture is retained in the bone, generate an incision of the limb with one of the instruments that you have provided, because you have left the wrist bone with the pain it had before; and this pain is of the kind of fist or iron from which this is the shape of it.</end_of_turn>
It is similar to a wound from which this is the cavity; and its width according to what you need of it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of it.</end_of_turn
The length of the incision should be as much as possible for the operation; there should be two limbs available as many times as possible, and one limb should be wide and the other narrow.</end_of_turn
And if the disruption of the membrane that you have incised when you extracted the fragment from the bone is wide, and you are sure of the hemostasis, then you adjust the two edges of the wound with sutures.</end_of_turn
And if the disruption is slight, or if you fear hemostasis, then you should cover the wound with a dressing and powder according to the amount of the wound.</end_of_turn
And if bleeding occurs, apply pressure with wine vinegar and olive oil, and hold it over that area.</end_of_turn
All this, however, that the splint should not rest on the fractured bone; and so that you can see the patient every day, because when the ligament is softened or the splint is already softened, then you should rectify this and strengthen the bandage.</end_of_turn
And so keep the patient’s hand elevated over the limb, and let the tingling of the limb be covered with a small cushion at night; so that the adjutorium of the limb is elevated to the level of the wrist joint; or that the arm is bound to the limb at the wrist.</end_of_turn
Do not remove the ligament if bleeding does not occur in the place or if hemostasis is not achieved, within twelve days.</end_of_turn
And if you have seen the face of the limb at that time, renew the plaster and adjust the fracture, restore that and leave it until the fracture of the wrist joint is healed and has coagulated.</end_of_turn
It is strong and comfortable according to the month in xxviii days, and several visits in several homes is done in the space of that time.</end_of_turn

Recovery from wrist fracture.
The scaphoid bone is fractured in the lateral part of the limb and is not fractured at the edges.</end_of_turn
And therefore when it is fractured in the middle of the limb – and it is fractured in the middle of the limb – and is not known except by touch, then according to the figure of the fracture force you to prepare it and reduce it according to the natural figure in every way that is possible for you to do.</end_of_turn
And so keep over the powdered wheat flour and egg white with an egg; and cover the limb with a splint of moderate size.
If there is a depression in some parts of the spatula, then you should cover that depression with a soft stop, and equalize the splint.</end_of_turn
And thus stretch out their arm with a long handle from the constriction downwards until it reaches the ankle bone without being impeded by the heel of the foot.
Consider the ligaments in every limb; and when any is softened, stretch the other until it is equal to the ankle bone if it is impeded by the heel of the foot.
And I grasp the patient over the ankle bone like this
The spatula is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
And thus when this number is completed, then dissolve the ligament, and know that what has begun from the bones should not be feared or dissolved
And if you proceed from the ankle bone and put down the tendon, then split over them, and keep them apart, and do as has been said concerning the fracture of the scaphoid bone after excision of the callous.

Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot bone.</start_of_turn>
The bones of the foot are fractured in the middle of the limb and thus it is necessary; but the extremities of the limb must not be moved until they are cicatrized and reduced.</start_of_turn
And concerning the accidents of the limb when the middle is fractured, that it declines towards the heel and causes great pain, and difficulty in walking, and sneezing, and vomiting; and is declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and is not hidden from sensation.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of the limb is that you rest the patient over the two ankles, and put between the heel of the limb a cushion; and then press on the muscles of the limb, and adjust the ribs of the limb to the greatest extent of two ribs, and suspend yourself in the operation of the limb and in the equalization as much as is possible and convenient, until you return the shape of the bone as it was before.</start_of_turn
And thus suspend over it the plaster and bandage and pause over the heel of the limb a soft cushion of gauze or leather and keep it like that; and close that in a loop; and suspend yourself over the fractured bone that it is not maimed; and move along the limb following the rounding of each bone, and stretch that which is strained downwards; and consider the ligament in every hour, and when it is softened stretch that one.</start_of_turn
And if necessary you must provoke a swelling of that, you must correct the fracture or pain, or swelling that occurs in the limb; then you must withdraw and remove that and evacuate the plaster and rectify what has occurred in the manner of limb care; and then return the plaster, sometimes to the extent of the face; and adjust the fracture until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn
Of the restoration of the ribs when they are fractured.</start_of_turn
You must know that a fracture of the ribs does not crack through but in hollow places that follow two; and from the extremities of them from the upper part does not happen except for that which is cartilaginous.</start_of_turn And you must take cognizance of them, you must not hide the inquiry from the sensation of them as it is said.</start_of_turn
And the restoration is that you bind the fracture as it is said according to the possibility, until it is bound as it is enough, and then plaster it and stretch the fractured bone with the ankle, if you wish.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the ribs is declining towards the heel, then it causes the patient severe pain and puncture, as if it were a puncture that occurs to that which has pleuracy; and for that reason the bone is put under the membrane; and it causes difficulty in walking, and sneezing, and vomiting without relief; and this is of difficult care.</start_of_turn
And already the Ancients have invented in that that which is not to be moved is to be held.</start_of_turn
And thus they say: keep the patient still from eating and drinking that which brings about swelling and wind, so that the belly is not swollen and is extended, and the fracture is not impeded by the parts outside.</start_of_turn
But let us beware of that so that it does not become the cause of causing callous. If it does not happen, we will help it to happen.</start_of_turn
And I say to you of some of them that it is to be stopped from their excessive windiness; and that they should succeed with force; and indeed it is like reasoning, but indeed it is feared lest the wind should tear away the superfluous things from the limb for the fracture.</start_of_turn
He said to them: cover the area with a cloth that is already immersed in oil, and sprinkle powder between the ribs until it is full; let the ligature be tight when it embraces that according to its roundness; and then cure the patient with a plaster of food and medicine.
If it causes acute constriction of the patient who does not suffer from it, and if the bones are pierced with a pointed needle, remember about the patient, for when you cover the area, uncover the ribcage, and then take off that instrument which conserves the bag, recalling which is prior, and that it incites the bones easily, and extract it.</end_of_turn>
And also let us adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, by stitching, and cure it with plaster until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if it happens that pus comes out, then cover the area with powdered charcoal in oil and rest over the area, and let the patient be cured with what covers the pus.</end_of_turn

Restoration of fracture of the spine and the pelvis.</end_of_turn>
Some veins are seen to be fractured in the bones of the pelvis, and the physician must attend to them, and similarly to the vertebrae of the spine.</end_of_turn And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he is healed or not, consider that sometimes the wounds are already softened and softened and softened and dead and you cannot move them or extend them or flex them without causing them pain, and when you squeeze them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and they do not feel any pain, then you know that he is not healed, and in such a state it is mortal.</end_of_turn
And if you touch them and feel that they are constricted with the fingers and pierced, then you know that the bone is saved and the patient will recover with care.</end_of_turn
And if you see the vertebrae of the spine like this and you want to know if he is healed or not, then consider the weight of his feet.</end_of_turn
Sometimes when they are softened, accidents happen to those which are accustomed to it in the greatest, and when you sit on the two feet, you feel dizziness and vomiting, which is its will, and many veins are seen supine on the two feet and they cannot urinate, then you know that it is mortal, and do not work in his care.</end_of_turn
Maybe if no other cause is seen in them, the cause is better and lighter.</end_of_turn
And the treatment of them is that you pierce the cavity of the pus with a cautery needle which rests on the fractured vertebra, with oil or with cold poultices of vinegar; rest over that any vein that gives blood to the fractured vertebra until the pus is softened.</end_of_turn
And let us pause one of the existing comfortable plasters and stretch over that which binds; and command the patient to rest and be quiet and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.</end_of_turn
And if an accident causes the fracture of the sacrum or any other cause which has already been separated from it, then cover that area and keep that bone still; and adjust the two lips of the wound, by stitching if it is large; and care for that which is inside the wound, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Maybe if the heel of the bone is fractured, and it is the end of the limb, then cover that area with your left hand on the buttock, and grasp the fractured bone with your other hand as much as is possible for an equitable proportion; and then rest over that plaster and bandage, if necessary, and stretch that.</end_of_turn
And if you feel the sacrum fractured in it, then keep that area still, and keep that, and care for the wound with the care that precedes until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Restoration of limb.</end_of_turn
The bones of the limb have fractured, and if they fracture, the fracture of them is nothing but communication in the extremities of those and are inscribed in the length and decline to the inward parts; and an accident happens to the patient pain in the area and puncture, and the limb is stupefacted when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of them is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture which is the figure of it.</end_of_turn
If the fracture is only in the extremity, then embrace that part as much as is appropriate until it is reassembled to its natural shape.
If the fracture is on the thigh or that it has already declined downwards, then make the patient sit on the edge of the bed until the fracture is restored And thus when it has been restored, place your hand over the plaster, and also over the heel or ankle, and hold firmly over the area where you do not fear puncture of the fracture or loosening of the staple.
Embrace the concavity with that which fills it, so that the swelling is equal, and command the patient to sleep on the two buttocks or recline on the side of the body
If by chance the cautery should slip, cease the extension of the limb and the restoration of the limb until the burn of the cautery has subsided; and place your hand over the limb until it has healed; then return to the restoration of the limb, and hold firmly as before
If there is injury to the heel bone or they are fractured, then treat them
(End of document
Note: The document ends abruptly and does not contain the complete translation of the treatise.
Note: "Adjutori" refers to the hip bone or pelvic bone
And if it is fractured, the restoration of the limb is in two ways, of which one is to grasp the thigh with a broad hand like this:
And with two ligaments put in two extremities, and hold it elevated
Keep the patient sitting on a chair; and take out the fractured limb from the thigh until it reaches the middle of the thigh where the curvature of the thigh is attached
And hold over any significant cause or discomfort, or extend it downwards; and the doctor should put something that holds the fracture firmly in place, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other way is that the patient lies on his side and the hand of the limb is suspended at the collarbone; and command two assistants to hold one hand above the fracture with their thumbs down; and the other to hold the foot of the limb; and whichever of them extends to the side
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then hold firmly over the fracture with one ligament and over the other, and whichever of the assistants extends both his hands.
Therefore if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, cover that half of the ligament over the trochanters and the other half the fracture must be over the thighbone.
Similarly if the fracture is close to the hip, cover that part of the ligament over that place and over the hipbone
Embrace that which facilitates and helps, and when it is restored as it should be, hold firmly what is not at risk of burn from the cautery
If there is a burn from the cautery, leave the dressing in place for seven days, and place over it a dry bandage soaked in oil and vinegar until the burn has healed, and then hold firmly once more
And the way to hold the limb is to place the plaster over the fracture, and then cover it with a layer of lint; and adjust the arm over that hip bone, and place your open hand over the thigh muscle
And hold the limb still and support the hip bone so that the limb is in place without hindering the healing of the fracture
And use crutches
And put on that staple which is stronger and more rigid than the others; and place between each staple the width of a finger, and the length of the staples according to the fracture in addition to three fingers from the whole side
And hold firmly over the staples with the stricture that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter
And that your dressing on the area of the fracture is more straight And when the fracture has healed, make the dressing smaller
And thus when sometimes the position of the staples and the dressing is as we have said when restoring the limb to its normal position, then do so
If you fear an embolism from the cautery, then leave the stricture and stars until the seventh day as we have said.
Consider the ligament in all parts for three days so that it does not become inflamed or swollen; or that food is prohibited from reaching the limb due to the stricture; therefore rectify all this as we have said.</end_of_turn>
Even if you are confident that no cause of this will arise, do not remove the ligature until three days have passed.</end_of_turn>
Let the patient rest on the side of the sick person, and the hands and feet on the stomach.</end_of_turn
Let the attendants eat a full meal of marrow, and consider at every hour of the night or day that it is not swollen or dissolved the figure of the fractured limb, or that the ligament is softened, therefore rectify all this with your skill.</end_of_turn
Let the patient abstain from food according to the order that we have given before, until the food is moderately digestible when consumed; and when it is consumed, cover that it is not vomited.</end_of_turn
As for the attendants and the chamber of the patient, they should be strong for forty days; and it should be covered that they are discharged and that baths are administered, and that medicines are given, which will rectify this.</end_of_turn
If the fracture is treated early, then do not remove the ligature from that limb until the seventh day or two months.</end_of_turn

Restoration of the fracture of the arm.</end_of_turn
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two knuckles; of which one is small, which is that which is called the thumb, and the other is great and is that which is grasped from beyond the thumb, from the part beyond the index finger.</end_of_turn
And if only the great knuckle is fractured, or only the small one, or both are fractured together.</end_of_turn
And when the small knuckle is fractured, then the restoration of it is light, and the healing is lighter.</end_of_turn
And when the great knuckle is fractured from the side, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult.</end_of_turn
And the worse of all is when both bones are fractured together.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the fractured bone is the small one above, it is convenient for the doctor to delay the restoration, which allows for little extension until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the great knuckle is fractured, it is necessary to pause the extension more urgently.</end_of_turn
And if both bones are fractured together, it is necessary to pause the extrusion much more strongly.</end_of_turn
And you must keep the figure of the hand still during the restoration of it and the extension of it supported over a cushion, and that the thumb be lower than the other fingers, and the hand be placed on a cushion.</end_of_turn
And let there be a cushion under the patient's arm or around the limb, so that the patient does not suffer work.</end>
And let the attendants extend the arm from the part beyond the elbow towards the shoulder or towards the ligament, and another attendant extend them similarly.</end_of_turn
And let the doctor unite the bone until it is reduced according to the best figure that can be obtained.</end_of_turn>
And if there is swelling of the bone, let him perforate to reduce all the swelling in the limb with your skill.</end_of_turn
And if there appears separated swelling that you do not hope will heal in the restoration of the limb, then you should leave it as it is according to the manner in which we have said.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture is on a bruise, and I have already said enough about this matter, take care of it.</end_of_turn
And if an embolism from the cautery occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then you must line a cloth with coarse fat and white wax, and mix some between specks of soot and smoothness, and strengthen the bandage over that which is over the stricture until the embolism is gone; and you must remove the cloth and pause the plaster prepared from powdered millet with clay and water, and put on a cushion, and keep the limb still for a longer and stronger star.</end_of_turn
E sapias que·l nombre de las stelas del bras so vi en las majors disposicios, o sia la fractura en un focil o en dos focils ensemps.
And so keep the compression on the area of the fracture firm and strong, and when more is required, extend the compression to the parts above or below the fracture, keep the compression a little less soft than before in proportion as the memory of the fracture is recalled at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the thread which is used to tie them should be neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have recommended
Consider the limb and the ligament nearby for several days. And if any cause occurs which requires rectification, do so as prudence dictates for the limb, and while you are doing so, cover that you may bathe the limb with cold water until the cause of the bruise has ceased
Keep the limb still until the pain has subsided, and then remove the compression
If the swelling has already subsided and the bone has already been rearranged, and if it appears to be at rest, then rectify everything with your skill
Consider also if the nourishment is forbidden to reach the limb due to excessive compression, for in this case keep the limb slightly relaxed and allow some time for it to recover before nourishing it again, and strengthen that
If there is no further cause for these things which we have mentioned, then do not remove the dressing for about xx days or so
And so suspend the patient's hand for his movement, and let him sleep on the bed two.
You know that this fracture is usually restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or more likely in xxviii days, according to the condition of the complexions and the skill of the physician

On the restoration of the fracture of the thumb and the fingers.</end_of_turn>
You know that at the thumb of the hand and the joints of the fingers there is a fracture, and that it does not happen to them except for soft swellings.</end_of_turn
And when the hand is fractured or bruised, the patient should continue to fall and lean on it as before, and place his hand over that which is extended.
And so the minister extends the broken bones and the physician joins them together until they are well united again
And so keep the plaster and bandage still, except in the case of an abscess; and keep the bone covered according to the amount of the area, and you have already covered that with a bandage.</end_of_turn>
If the fracture is in the area of the palm you must hold the palm of the hand against the chest, and order the patient to strengthen that which is his fractured thumb; strengthen that with the palm long.</end_of_turn
And let the limb be supported on a cushion so that the limb is applied to the palm; and strengthen that as much as it covers.</end_of_turn
If the fracture is at the edges, keep the thumb and the other bone of the palm relaxed, so that the hand is open and closed; and keep the compression still, even if the hand is rotated between the fingers and their ligaments.</end_of_turn
If there is a fracture in some of the joints of the fingers, if it is said to be loose, let it be united as it is convenient and strengthen that with the palm of the hand; and if you wish, keep the small joint of the thumb raised so that the fracture is elevated and not bruised.</end_of_turn
If the fracture is in the other fingers, just as in the middle part or in the index, or in the ring or in the little finger, keep it united and bound with the finger to which it is adjacent; or bind them all together as a whole, which is better; or keep the small bone still as we have said before.</end_of_turn
Consider in your restoration, and so do those who are experienced in surgery, what is said concerning the abscess and oppose it — with the surgical procedure — with what covers when any cause of these things occurs, as is repeated in the narration.</end_of_turn
Chapter XIV.
De restauracio de fractura del os de la coyssa.
The thigh bone is fractured and is recognized according to the feeling that it is converted to the neighboring part and the surrounding pus
And the restoration is done so that the ligament is stretched over the fracture and another ligament leaves the fracture, and the patient is placed prone on the abdomen and on the face
Then extend all the ligament to its part according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone
Even if it is close to the hip, then the ligament is properly placed at the heel towards the fifth part, so that the extension is made there, and the other ligament leaves the fracture
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the heel, then make the proper ligament at the heel and the extension to the other parts
And the doctor should bite the bone on both sides more than enough to reduce that according to the natural shape and the bone is united by a good junction; the hand should be kept still and plastered, if necessary, until healing has taken place. If necessary, leave it for five days until the swelling has subsided, and then return to your care
The bandage should be so tight: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, and bend it two or three times, and remove the excess; and then cover the limb until it reaches the hip and the heel of the thigh
And inside put a long thread between the thigh and the limb towards the heel, and pass the ends of the thread from the part furthest from the wound towards the two parts of the wound, and then roll over the limb and the thigh as much as the bandage allows
And keep the thigh still in the place of the fracture and put a splint on the limb of the wound
And fill the spaces between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the swelling is coagulated.
And start to tighten the bandage firmly from the middle of the fracture with three or four layers, and when you have finished tightening the ligament at the site of the fracture, the bandage should be less tight and lighter and softer
And extend the two ends of the thread to the lower parts until it reaches the heel of the foot, and tighten both ends of the laces of the other part so that the ligament is not pulled from the root
And leave the bandage on for a while, so that it does not cause stiffness or swelling or pain; and if any of these things happen, take it off and correct what has happened as soon as possible, as we have said above
If the bone is very painful, then bite it as much as possible; if not, remove it and leave only that which is necessary, and care for the cause of the pain until it is healed.
Every wound is strengthened in this fracture of the thigh as much as the laces are adjusted to the laces, as we have said in the instructions and in the arms.
Therefore, when restoring it in this way, it must not cause the patient to become limping; and if only one limb is restored, that of the other must also be applied, because it is necessary that both should be limping at the same time.
And you must know that the thigh is strengthened in seventy days or a few months or a few weeks, according to the diversity of complications and the other resources.

On the restoration of the fracture of the shin bone.</end_of_turn>
You must know that the fracture of the shin bone is usually caused by excessive tension of the surrounding tissues.</end_of_turn
If the fracture does happen, it is only a crack or break in its parts, and this is accompanied by swelling or pain, and over this rests the feeling.</end_of_turn
And the restoration is done so that it is bound up again as much as is broken in its parts until it is united and joined as much as possible for the sake of equality and facility and manufacturing.</end_of_turn
And keep still the plaster and put on a round splint, if you think it is necessary; and tighten the bandage as much as is convenient.</end_of_turn
Considering all the precautions recommended in other fractures, such as the cautery aftercare and resembling those which are opposed to any mishap that may arise until the patient is completely healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn

When both bones are fractured together, the limb is converted into pieces.</start_of_turn
When the small bone is fractured, the limb is converted into fragments.</start_of_turn
When the large bone is fractured, the limb is deformed, and this is the cause of your doubts.</start_of_turn
And administer extension, equalization, and ligature of the fragments according to the healing process.</start_of_turn
However, if the fracture of the limb is slight and without soft tissue damage, that the extension should be milder and lighter, and relieve with your skill.</start_of_turn
In the limb there is any cause of operation on the bone, and that is when you have healed the fragments and when you have completed the whole operation, then you will take pieces of sponge of the foot which is paused from below the causes which are paused alone, and so you must do without causing damage to the hands, and make the length of those according to the length of the limb and the degree of bending inwards.</start_of_turn
And cover with two coverings each bandage according to its length, and suspend one over the part of the limb from one side and the other from the other side, and be from the nail inwards of the foot.</start_of_turn
And tie the two fragments in three places at the two extremities and in the middle part, so that the limb is prohibited from leaning to the right and left, and is in a good position.</start_of_turn
And an elastic bandage has already been administered according to the length of the limb; and keep the limb fixed in it so that it conserves its movement.</start_of_turn
And most importantly cover more than when there is a fracture, and when that is properly done.</start_of_turn
Consider in every day the limb and study it in order to understand it better, and you will protect it from aftercare and from inflammation or other causes resembling that; and when any of those causes occurs, then you must stop it until it is healed.</start_of_turn

On the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and the toes.</start_of_turn
The ankle does not usually fracture; however, the bones of the foot sometimes fracture; and the toes rarely fracture, and it does not happen to them except in cases of great violence.</start_of_turn
And if the bones of the foot must fracture and sometimes those bones must be elevated between them, then you must place the foot on the prepared ground like when going out.</start_of_turn
And suspend one foot over that which is elevated of those bones, and support them, and press, and heal those until they are restored in their places.</start_of_turn
And suspend plaster and stop discharge, and keep the belly of the foot a little wider than a small loaf of bread with two plaster caps.</start_of_turn
And strengthen that which is stretched out that has been straightened, because you have covered it with cloths and other causes that indicate.</start_of_turn
And when three or four days have passed, then you will remove the ligament, because you will find the bones healed, or fractured or dislocated, and the operation in those is as dangerous as with the needle.</start_of_turn
However if any of those bones are fractured, then restore those, and keep those as I have said and recommend concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand.</start_of_turn Then pause for a moment, according to the length of the finger, and put a little pressure on it; and then let the patient rest on this table which is recommended to you, and strengthen that restriction downwards.
May be if these bones are fractured two or three or more, then you pause on each finger until you have grasped the amount of their circumference covered in soft leather, and strengthen the table at the bottom of the foot, and stand on one of the feet of the table to keep the belly of the foot well retained.</end_of_turn>
And it is convenient for you to remember that you must not neglect other causes which we have mentioned in other fractures of the accidents which we have mentioned; and be attentive to every mishap in which you suspect a fracture.</end_of_turn>

Of fracture of the bone of the thigh and of the fibula and of the heel bone.</end_turn
When the bone of the thigh is fractured, then cease that movement in the groin, and incline that towards the side of two, a little, and keep it from behind.</end_turn
And put the mattress under the hip, and make a point in the hip as much as you hope; and elevate the two little bones gradually, until everything that is outside is forgotten until the fractured part returns to its place as much as you hope and the fractured bone returns.</end_turn
And pause the powder over the two of them, and when you wish to urinate, remain in the groin easily and approach; and reduce and return that as you commanded at the beginning, and approach returning the powder first.</end_turn
And do thus for seven days or until it is restored.</end_turn
And if you wish, take once of vinegar and strengthen over the ankle a tube of glass; and put the whole bladder into the hip, and approach sprinkle in the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within the hip, because the fracture returns.</end_turn
And approach both with hip and stay for five days as we have recommended, until it is healed.</end_turn
And when the bone of the fibula of the foot or of the thigh is fractured, then administer in the restoration and agility of them what we have recommended for the bone of the ankle.</end_turn
And what is hidden in these principal fractures is not hidden in these fractures; and little do they know those who study and use this book well; for that fracture means to you in the greatest possibilities of physical restoration and in the strengthening of them, and therefore understand well.</end_turn
But when the heel bone is fractured, take gauze of wool, and put the heel bone in that; and pause over the covering of the cloth, and be covered, and approach leave it for three days or until it is healed.
Chapter XIX.</end_turn
Of the restoration of fracture of the bones when it is soft.</end_turn
It is convenient in that in which the fracture occurs with soft swelling, and more especially if the bone is great as for example the bone of the thigh or the ankle bone, or something similar, that you take care of these things and flebotomize them as much as possible if the conditions of flebulation allow you or if the testifiers tell you so as we have said.</end_turn
And if the swelling subsides healed, then cover that you keep the retention of them in that way in which you powdered over them before it was shattered, if for another cause it does not exist.</end_turn
And approach commence to restore the fracture in that same day, and do not prolong that, if not after that.</end_turn
But if after that there is apostemal discharge, then leave the restoration of them until the apostemal discharge has ceased, and do not approach them for three days and three nights in total, for you will cause other accidents.</end_turn
But if the fractured bone is prominent over the edge of the wound, then cover that you perforate to reduce that and to equalize that as much as the greatest ease and with little extension.</end_turn
But if the extension is not to your liking and the equality of them with the thighs is not to your liking, then you reduce that as much as your greatest ease; and that is a wound that is made of iron, the length of which is of seven or eight and the width is according to the quantity of the swelling; and for that it is necessary for the doctor to anticipate those three or four according to the quantity that you indicate in the care of all sorts of fractures.</end_turn
Be gentle, and take little hold of the limb for fear of breaking it during the operation.
Be cautious of the limb to which the mark is made in the groin; grasp it loosely so that you do not damage the surrounding area.
This is how you do it:
It is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", so be gentle
Because it must be held elevated above the limb bone that is prominent
And pull out the limb until the bone returns, and keep it equalised with any bandage
Therefore force the limb to be equal between the fractures, and if the fractured limb is slight and you do not perceive any discomfort, then you must insert the limb back into the bone so that the instrument has power over it
If you are unable to reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then you must cover it with what covers the incision of the physicians who have advised you; or saw off that part with one of the saws in whatever way you can
And remove that which remains in the bone of roughness and small sores.
When the bone is reduced and the patient feels great pain, know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to comfort the patient greatly
When the bone has been restored as you have done, and when you have submerged the limb in black vinegar, and properly if it is summer, and do not put anything greasy or oily on the wound, so that it does not cause swelling and corruption
And immediately administer cold compresses at the time of the meal to complement the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered until you have sutured it with needles and used bandages according to the quantity of the wound
Beware that you do not pull the wound at the fracture, because it may cause the physicians to lose faith in the treatment, and it will cause great pain to the patient, either death or serious illness, so be careful And if the limb is stiff, soft, different from the stiffness of other fractures
If the wound is large or bad, and you fear concerning that limb the accidents that we have recommended, and you feel pain in the area, know that you should not put on the stitches, but rather put on a dressing of coarse cloth instead of needles and strengthen it with those
And when a few days have passed since the wound began, if it has become engorged, know that the limb has regained its natural position, and immediately administer calamine, which is what we usually do for wounds, along with tetracycline and similar medications.
Remember that you must remove the dressing and consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and that the limb is prepared in such a way that the swelling will recede from the parts below with ease
If several days have passed since the wound appeared, and it is neither consolidated nor has it been excised from the limb, know that here is an obstruction of the small ones so that you must examine the wound again with more attention And from those obstructions those that are separated remain and are extracted, those that are not separated remain and cause the limb to swell and cause pain, pierce through to insert them as you can.
If gangrene or blackening occurs in the wound, it is a sign of festering or other kind of corruption and putrefaction, know that you must immediately seek advice from the chief physician regarding the treatment which is preceded by narration in the capital city
And when you are in doubt as to what should be done and your appearance is poor: when the limb is bruised, pay attention to the limb as if it were the bone of the thigh or the knee, and like those of the great limbs, and do not presume any attraction of it, or the extraction of it which may cause death; have the limb left in peace until it has healed naturally, for it is likely that it will fall away by itself within approximately twenty or thirty days And if you take care of the wound as I have said, and if you do not leave it, it will heal by itself
Capital city.
On the treatment of the wound which occurs in the aftermath of any fracture.
The swelling that has occurred in this fracture is particularly violent in the area of the joints and is often seen in this condition. It hinders the natural function of the limb.
Consider whether the swelling is recent and administer astringent medicines that have been shown to be useful in this condition, and see, and let the patient lie down, and ask about any nausea or vomiting, and look at the color of the urine; in this way you can take some of these medicines or all of them, and confirm that they are effective in stopping the bleeding, or amalgams of blood, or other hemorrhages, and place the hand over the swelling to prevent further bleeding.</end_of_turn>
Keep the limb still for several days; then remove it and repeat the process until the swelling subsides; or stretch over that lamina of membrane that hangs down, because it has the property of holding up everything that is swollen in the limb.</end_of_turn>
Even if the swelling has already hardened and stretched, and it is necessary to drain it, do so cautiously, and take out the thickest parts first, and then remove the excess; or prick it with a needle so that the pus escapes, and keep it closed until it is healed; and take care of it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Restoration of the fracture when it is restored and then keep the limb still and flexible not according to its natural habit.</end_of_turn>
When a bone fracture has been restored, and then the limb is still and flexible, it is not useful for anything except for certain causes: of which one is the multitude of solutions of ligaments and that their tension is not sufficient; or for excessive tension of the ligaments so that the nourishment of the limb is prohibited; or for a multitude of unnecessary emboli; or for excessive movement that is not in its time; or for weakness in the body of the patient and for his debility.</end_of_turn
Care for this is to feed the patient and make him comfortable until his health is multiplied in him; administer baths; and give him wine and let him know about it.</end_of_turn
And keep the limb still so that the wound does not prevent the limb from receiving nourishment, or continues to bleed excessively until the nourishment returns to its natural state.</end_of_turn
End of treatise.</end_of_turn
Care for fractured bones when they are restored gently and prevent them from being operated on again by anything that covers them.</end_of_turn
When an injury occurs to a limb that has already been restored, keep the healing process of the fracture slow and gentle to avoid further injury to the fractured bone and swelling, and is for this reason that faith is placed in the limb, even though the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation, however it does not cover that you must disobey the advice of the one who is responsible for the limb that it is to be treated for a new fracture.</end_of_turn
It is already known among doctors and restorers who have made use of us in this matter; and this operation is not to be repeated without great fear of the signal that is mortal.</end_of_turn
If swelling and nodulation are recent, it is necessary to drain them with lukewarm water in which there are many soothing herbs, such as chamomile, fennel, meadowsweet, and similar; or make an application of plaster with plaster of Paris or olive oil, and apply it; or take figs that are bruised with pomegranate seeds and dissolve them with honey or oil of chamomile.</end_of_turn
All these remedies are dissolved with constant gentle rubbing that is both in the hottest and coldest seasons, and is administered in every hour of the day.</end_of_turn
If the swelling has already hardened and is strong, and is converted into a stone, and is caused, it is necessary to care for it with fire, for the pus must be evacuated and the continuation of the bone must be dissolved, and it is to be understood that excess of swelling of the middle of the bone with the bone that is underneath is to be evacuated with ease and with study.</end>

On the matter of dislocation.</end_of_turn>
Dislocation is the sudden displacement of any joint of the limb, which is prohibited from movement, and which causes pain and great lesions in the body.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when an accident occurs with dislocation, it is necessary to perform it as soon as possible so that it can be reduced, and do not delay, for if it is delayed, the limb is swollen and strong, and it is difficult to reduce the dislocation.</end_of_turn
And let me remind you that during the apostate hour, neither must the patient be made to vomit nor stretch, for these things cause spasms and pains that are harmful.
When this happens, the doctor must cover the patient's face with a wet cloth, and immediately administer cold water and oil; and gently reduce the pressure
And all parts must be treated with the water from which the memory will arise in their location
And thus I have ordered the heads of dislocation according to the order of fracture; from the upper part of the body inwards to the lower part of the body outwards.
Chapter XXIII.
On the treatment of dislocation of the jawbone downwards
So dislocated are both mandibles if they are not taken hold of; and the dislocation of both is useful in two ways: that either they are slightly displaced from their places for little movement, or that they are completely dislocated and united, until they are softened at the junction where saliva from the patient escapes and which does not permit them to open their mouth or close their lips, and their tongue is wrapped in their word
When the dislocation is slight, the patient returns to their major position by themselves without any cause.
When the dislocation is complete and united, the doctor must immediately administer reduction of it, and must not delay in doing so
And the minister has the head of the patient, and the doctor puts their thumb of their right hand at the root of the dislocation of the mandible inwards of the mouth, if the dislocation is of one side; or that they put their two thumbs together, if the dislocation is of two sides, and the others say from the rest of them to hold; and the doctor commands the patient to stop their mandibles and remove anything from their jaws; and the doctor should touch the mandible and bandage the mandible until it returns to its place
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both mandibles are simultaneously dislocated, the doctor should administer evaporation with cold water and oil, until the reduction of both is achieved and not delayed in both, as we have said
And when they return and are softened, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, the doctor should suspend over those little particles of matter around the root, and apply wax and oil; and gently bind them with ligatures
And let the patient sleep on their two sides, with the head between two cushions, so that neither side is injured; and do not force them to swallow anything further; have the patient's tongue tied, until when the pains have subsided and the mandibles are not dislocated, the doctor may give them something to drink again
And let the drink be administered with ease, and do not work on the opening of the patient's mouth because of food and drink and conversation, until the mandible is healed and recovered
And if the reduction of two mandibles is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and is not converted to its proper place, the doctor must give the patient feverish sweats and vinegar drinks, and they are very likely to become agitated and vomit violently
When you have done this many times, the doctor will learn that it is a loss; and most of those to whom this has happened die within a few days.
Chapter XXV.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle
The collarbone is not displaced from the back because of its continuity with the ribs; and some say that it is displaced outwards, and this is known from the feeling
The restoration of it is that the patient sits on their two sides and extends their arms outwards And gently compress the area with your palm with strong compression, so that it returns
And suspend over that plaster and particles and strengthen that
And the extremity of that which was previously supported by the collarbone is not dislocated in any day; the doctor must reduce it and soften it as we have said and as you are accustomed to doing with your instruments
And suspend over that plaster, particles, and traction, and command the patient to remain calm and at rest until it is healed
And thus this remedy is reduced to the extremity of the muscle when it is separated from the socket.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</end_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.

If the joint is dislocated without any visible cause or due to some other reason, it is necessary to administer cautery three times, as it is said in the chapter on cautery.
If all this is done and seven days have passed, and the ligament is not loosened and the joint is not stabilized, and the swelling and tension are reduced without any visible cause, and the limb is not elevated, it is known that the nerves of the limb are either numb or stretched or swollen, and that the limb is paralyzed forever
As for the dislocation of that which is useful to the feet and the knee or the buttocks, reduction is useful with an impulse and extension at the most, until it returns.
And let it be administered in the other place where there is tension, and care for that until it is healed
And if it happens that the healing takes place slowly in the limb and there is delay in its movement, it is necessary to support the limb greatly until that gravity is relieved and returns to its natural state
Chapter XXVVII.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the knee.</end_of_turn>
You know that the knee joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated in all parts, especially in the part which is facing the part behind, and the dislocation of the limb is not recognized until it is displaced from its place; when you adjust the knee which is displaced, immediately you will know that the joint is depressed and cannot bend the limb, nor touch anything below the muscle.
And you must tighten the knee, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible before applying cautery; for if you apply the cautery without reducing the dislocation, it is difficult to reduce it, and it is not good for healing; and especially when it is at the back of the limb, for it is worse of all other kinds of dislocation, and of greater pain, and many veins are swollen on that side.
And the restoration of the limb, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand of the limb is extended with two thumbs, and the limb is expanded, and the hands of the physician are placed on the knee and leave it there, and the practitioner covers the joint with his thumbs, or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place
And even if the dislocation is at the front, it returns as soon as you bend your finger with your hand, until you perforate the knee with the base of your palm
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, the physician must administer violent extension and great force
And two assistants extend the limb, and hold this support of two assistants so that it does not slip from the extension.
And let the limb be rotated throughout its extent, because it is wrapped around the thumb, or ligament
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, put some oil there so that these things which help to lubricate the joint facilitate; and then press the joint with force until it returns.
And when the reduction is made, cover it with that plaster in which is stipticity and exudation with a mixture of flour and water, and extend it with stricture descending, and suspend the limb from the column, and leave it like that for several days.
And so if the joint is formed in its proper place, then you will loosen the ligament of the limb and leave it like that.</end_of_turn>
And if the joint is not healed, the physician will repeat the plaster and the ligament, and leave it like that for several days until it is extruded; and then loosen that.</end_of_turn>
And if it happens that gravity suddenly affects the reduction of the joint, and the limb is in movement, the physician must administer moisture in the limb and external friction, and pressure, until it is relieved; or rest over the joint without any greasy motion; and tie it up, and leave it like that during the day and night And so on, put it in water; and when the swelling subsides, the physician will cool the joint with temperate friction, and then repeat over that which was said, which is gentle rocking, a little bit of stretching, and the second, and the third time, etc.</end_of_turn The corruption has already spread throughout the bowels within the bath, until it is delimited.</end_of_turn
Or if you wish, rest over that wound of the moist cow and cover it with a border and bandage; and make some veins, because that is moist and reduces the swelling.</end_of_turn>
Capitol XXVIII
Treatment for dislocation of the bones, that is between the arm and the hand.
The bone of the hand is dislocated many times, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, while the opposite is with the other joints, more so because speed is necessary in the reduction in the hour in which it is dislocated, so that the limb does not suffer from post-traumatic stiffness or that there occurs in it post-traumatic injury.
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the wrist of the patient on a board and extend the hand of him, and the doctor places his hand or palm on the imminent part of the joint, and massages that until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered if the palm is already bowed towards the belly of the hand, for in that case the patient must hold two of his hands over a board during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is antecedent, you must hold two of his hands, for in that case the position of his hand that is inside intrinsically over the board so that the hand of the doctor rests on that imminent part of the joint.
And therefore, if it returns well, it is good; and if not, when you have strained it as much as you can without causing further displacement, leave it; and do not attempt it again until the pain has disappeared from it.
However, the joint remains according to its stiffness; and do not notice to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot be strained without causing any cause; for the nerves are often torn or stretched, and it is not caused by it except for the stretching of the cautery at the time of treatment.
Therefore, when the limb is returned, leave it resting on the bandage that we have recommended, and leave it strapped for five days; and then let it be loosened and left, and exercise the hand of him.
If the movement of the limb is delayed and happens in it any gravity, leave cold water on that and some greasy ointment, until the swelling is relieved.
Chapter XXVIII
Treatment for dislocation of the bones.
Some bones of the hand are dislocated throughout the body.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated at the two of the palm or at the belly of the hand, the doctor must hold the finger and impel the dislocation towards the toes until it returns to its place
And support the head of the finger, and suspend that beyond the part that is dislocated, and leave that for two days.
And then suspend that and extend that until it is equal in that place again
And when that will not be, lie that according to that narration, and do not cease loosening that in the day and exercising, and lie that at night; and do this for several days until it is healed
And do the same with that, if it is dislocated at the belly of the hand, and leave that at that part and do that with the first operation, until it is healed.
And do the same with that when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter XXIX
Treatment for dislocation of the vertebrae of the back
When an accident occurs to some of the vertebrae of the back or the pelvis, and some vertebrae of those bones remain locked in place, in that case there is no treatment, for death covers the patient
And a sign of that is that the evacuation of the patient is outside of their will, and cannot be retained; and some bones of the hand are softened in some members of them or two limbs or two arms of them, or one of them; or a vertebra is dislocated from its place, which is neither softened nor can it be reduced to its place without causing the evacuation of those to four parts.
Therefore that is already dislocated behind and is called gelliosis.
However, the treatment of that is that the doctor considers if the gelliosis occurred in infancy, for in that case it is neither a treatment nor a healing of everything
However, in those cases where it is seen in the case or by percussion or by appearance, I will say that the ancients spoke of long methods of treatment, of which the most return with profit; however, I have already mentioned that I will abbreviate that which is little useful from the abundance of that, for my proximity to the understanding of my exposition, to which I have exposed and explained it with various instruments that I have shown and explained with various instruments that I have used.
And these are not cured except for those which happen directly in the two places where I recommend it.</start_of_turn>
And it is that the disease should be spread over its face over towards the edge of the heel, and that it should be spread downwards so that it does not touch the toes.</start_of_turn
And immediately put two supports under the foot, one fixed to the ground at the heel end and the other under the toes in the opposite heel end.</start_of_turn
The minister has the support, and it is not fixed in a fossa; and another minister has the other according to that manner.</start_of_turn
And immediately cover the head of the disease and leave only the toenails uncovered; and extend the limb of the ligament to the support which is above the head of the foot, and tie that one in it; and immediately strengthen the other ligament over the ankles of the limb with which they are joined, and over the chest; and adjust all the ligaments and tie those in the other support which is above the toes.</start_of_turn
And immediately the minister grasps and extends the ligament towards the part of the support, and do not leave the two supports and the ligaments of the thighs in those places where they are fixed, even though they are not fastened in this way.</start_of_turn
And the doctor places his palms on the spine and strengthens within it until it returns, or that he places over that a table, and immediately adjust under the table the thighs of the patient until they return.</start_of_turn
But if it does not return in this way, the hour takes a table whose width or length is three palms, and grasp on the wall of which we have said that it is near the disease a place where the end of the table is. And immediately stop the large part of the table on the spine, and the doctor places the thighs on the other end, and push until the spine is contracted and returns to its place.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, or turn around with the hand; and that you stay on the ground with the head of the disease at the heel of the foot two palms, and that the head of the foot be at the heel of the foot immediately two palms; and that the length which is between each support be a palm, and that is enough in every support which has been made until it returns, and that no part should be fixed on the ground so that it should not be crushed.</start_of_turn
And there is one support round in which the return is made, and it is rotated in the two joints of the two supports.</start_of_turn
And at the end of it there is a joint in which the support is formed, the length of which is a palm from the point where it is rotated; and in the other two supports it is like that.</start_of_turn
And immediately strengthen the ligaments which you have stretched in the feet of the disease in the part which is above the head of the foot, and the ligaments which you have stretched in the thighs of the patient in the part which is above the toes.</start_of_turn
And immediately order that every return should be held by a minister who grasps the return with his hand, and the doctor should grasp the spine as we have said.</start_of_turn
And immediately when the spine returns, and the limb is relaxed, the hour covers that it pauses immediately with a bandage of wool, and stops; and immediately place over the bandage the table whose width is three fingers or more, and the length of which is equal to the extent of the swelling, and over the part of the spine.</start_of_turn
And immediately bind with the ligament which we have said, and use the disease for mild nourishment until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if any remaining danger remains in the limb at the end of the healing, the hour covers that anti-inflammatory medicines should be administered that soften and soothe with the administration of the table for a long time, which we have recommended; and they are already administered in that limb in a lead plate.</start_of_turn
And every tremor that happens behind the spines of the two is cured by that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already mentioned that it does not cover that there is any other cause of death with this medicine, because it will make you act foolishly.</start_of_turn

Say that the ankle joint and the joint of the muscle do not deviate only by dislocation alone, but also by those that happen to the other joints of the foot, removing and concaving them
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, that is, to the inside, or to the outside, or to the front, or to the back.
Most often it is dislocated inwards, and little to the front or to the back
And the sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that when you adjust the limb of the sick person to the limb of the healthy person, the heel of the sick person is more prominent than that of the healthy person, and the sick person cannot bend their foot without causing them pain, and that is where the tip of the cushion has already passed.
The sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that it happens on the outside of the ankle in the opposite way to this accident
The sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that the limb is extended towards the front, however, it does not bend where it hurts, and if you force it to bend there, you will not be able to walk on the front of the foot; the urine is retained and the swelling is posttraumatic, and you must walk on the ankle bone
The sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that neither the heel nor the toe can be bent, and the limb is shorter than the other limb, and the swelling is softened, and the cushion has passed over that place
The greatest reduction of this kind of dislocation is that you must consider, when, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it is already outdated from when you should have administered a reduction to it and it remains according to its situation; in this case it is not in this treatment that you must look for benefit; for in this case there is no benefit in doing so
More in the one in which the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four species of dislocation, then you must take care that you return the joint to its place and extend it outwards, and upwards and downwards, for strong pain will return if you do not do so and it will not be cured by any other treatment
More, if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare to minister strong and extend the limb of the side that you left behind, or at the least its most, or bind what is bound over the limb below the ankle; and another minister extend your hand of that side outwards so that your thumbs touch the tip of your toes; and strengthen the bandage around the ankle and keep another minister on the other extremity of the limb.
And the extension of the limb or of the outer part to the ankle or from the back to the heel, or from the front to the ankle bone.
And the extension of all of them together until the sick person’s limb is elevated above the ground and remains hanging down
And this kind of extension is common to all four of them
Therefore, if the dislocation returns as we have said, it is good; but if not, it is necessary in every kind of treatment that we speak of in this treatise.
In the reduction of it, when it is dislocated, if the dislocation is inward, cover that the sick person is resting on their buttocks; and place the ligaments over the ankle in that place where the tip of the cushion passes over between the ankle and the heel; and extend the ligament from the part of the ankle towards the higher part of the ankle bone.
And another minister strongly grasps the toes, and immediately grasp the large part of the ankle of the sick person and extend outwards for a violent extension, so that the pain returns to its place
This kind of treatment is of less severe treatment than the others for this member.
More, if you are excused for it and do not obey the order in this kind of treatment, it is necessary that you bind both feet of the sick person together with a strong and tight bandage, over both ankles and both toes
And let the length of each be equal to the quantity of four fingers, and let the bandage of the sick person be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers
And let the sick person be suspended above the head of the foot, and that it be in the middle; and let the length of the limb from the ground be equal to the quantity of two thumbs
Then command a strong youth to reduce the thigh bone, and suspend one hand of the patient with the other youth, and the other youth will reduce the thigh with force, so that the joint returns to its rightful place quickly.
More in the proper reduction, when it is a displacement outwards, cover that the patient bites down on the jaw according to what we have recommended in the former case; and keep the ligament stretched over the affected limb and over the foot.
And two assistants shall be present, one at the feet of the patient, and the other at the head; and assistants shall be present with hands adjusted to the middle of the bed placed over which wet cloths are spread, so that the patient is not dampened because the cushion is between the patient's thighs, because you must extend the lower limbs without tension
And every minister extends to their part, and the doctor with their hand grasps the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is at the front, it is necessary that the limb be extended forward, as it is said in the aforementioned treatise concerning the thigh; and the doctor places the thumb of their right hand on the affected area, and with the other hand grasp that which is at the other side, and at that grasping pause that which is extended to the lower limbs at the front.</start_turn>
And if the dislocation is at the back, it is not necessary that the patient's lower limbs be extended, but it is elevated above the ground; because it must be supported on a hard surface, as it is said about the swelling of the limb when the outer surface is dislocated; and it is over the face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, without any spasm.
And it is necessary to administer pressure with a table over the area where the joint is located.<end_turn>
Therefore when the reduction is completed as we have said — and the sign of the reduction of the limb is not hidden from you, that is to say that you extend two limbs of the patient, and when you have once grasped those and the patient extends their thigh limb and expands the lower limb, then you know that the limb is returned as it should be — and you adjust two cushions and pause close by and grasp the bandage so that the width is not swollen in any part; and keep the patient at rest for three days or four.
And remove the ligament and the dressing, and compare one limb with the other.
When you see those swells vanish in the dressing, then you know that the dislocation is already stopped, and then you allow the patient to walk.
And if you see any cause of discomfort, then you return and plaster that, and withdraw that according to your first structure, and leave that for three days
And remove that, and make the patient walk slowly for a few days, until they are comfortable.
Chapter XXXII.</start_of_turn>
On the care of dislocation of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is dislocated in three ways, that is to say that it is dislocated outwards, and at the front, and downwards more than at the back; and it is not dislocated at the front
And the sign of the dislocation of the limb is that the patient commands the patient to flex their limb over the cushion; knowing that the thigh is dislocated
And the restoration of all these ways is that you make the patient grasp the limb with their hand, even if you can do it above what was said; put two cushions under the face of the limb, and place the foot of the limb between the thighs; and then order the patient to grasp the thigh of the limb with your hands, and hold that between the thighs of the limb as if it were about the thigh of the limb, and another minister extend the lower limb until the thigh returns to its place
And the sign of the limb's recovery is that their limb adheres to the cushion without suffering.
And plaster that and make them adhere the limb to the cushion, and bind those together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove those.
Do not make the patient walk for a few days, until they are healthy and comfortable
If the reduction of the limb is excused, then administer strong extension to the ligaments that preceded the treatment of the groin.
When the reduction of the limb is excused, then administer strong extension to the ligaments that preceded the treatment of the groin.
From the treatment of dislocation of the ankle
Some bones of the ankle are swollen due to slight displacement, and some bones are dislocated according to custom, and the dislocation is caused either by the ligaments or by the bones themselves
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells up proceeding from the part that is dislocated
The treatment for displacement is gentle reduction, and it is that it is facilitated by the most and that it is equalised as soon as it returns
When the dislocation is complete, cover that the patient groans in pain, and have a strong and valiant assistant behind the two of his legs in the middle of the limb
And put your right hand on the top of the foot towards the heel, and your left hand on the front of the foot in the place of the ankle
And pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and with the left hand make two fingers, and extend with the left; and press the heel of the foot against the right side of the limb.
And do as we have counted two fingers
And press the foot against the third finger, and you are at the ankle
So if it returns in one or two times according to this manner, and if sometimes the foot is equalised, it is good; otherwise, when the limb does not return, repeat the operation until it returns
If the reduction is prohibited for you as we have recommended, then make the patient walk on the toes over the ground, and loosen a little the plaster cast on the ground, and that he sits between the thighs, and you have already placed your hand over the limb to prevent it from moving
And let the assistant of the limb hold his thighs, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with the ligaments that lie over the heel of the foot; and extend whichever minister against the extension of the heel, and that the plaster cast exists between the thighs, so that the body of the limb is not pulled towards the front beyond its extension
And the doctor will wrap up the dislocation with the thighs, and another assistant will hold the healthy limb at the front, so that the dislocation returns with ease
And thus when the dislocation returns and you are declared to have completed the reduction of the limb, then pause the plaster and gently stretch that which is strongly ligated, and join the foot to the limb with the cast
And beware or take care of the nerves that are behind the ankle, because the ligament over that should not be tight and must not be stretched too much
And leave it so for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, stretch it out
And take it off on the fourth day or on the fifth, and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days If it is forced to go forward despite that space, it is not wrong to ensure that the dislocation is not dissolved and corrupted, and that it does not receive care
If by chance it happens after the removal of the cautery that the limb must be remade, then cover that you administer in the cessation of the pain that preceded our narration in another place of care and bandaging, until it is remade
Chapter XXXIII.
Treatment for dislocation of the bones of the foot.
When it is dislocated, it must be equalised with little extension of the limb; and that which is not difficult, be joyful
If the dislocation is in the ankle bones of the two feet, then make the patient walk on the toes over the ground or on a table, and remain like this as if he were going
And put your foot down, and stop the ankle on what comes out of the joints, and hold that until it returns, and that you see that it is already equalised and does not appear again in the immediate vicinity
And place under the belly of the foot of the limb a board that covers the whole foot, with two caps, and hold that down by stretching and closing firmly for three days; and take it off and let him walk again after forty days, until it is restored and the redness is insured
Capitol .xxxv.
From the species of dislocation which are caused by swelling or fracture or any other lesion.
When these things happen, and you perforate the wound of the cure and restore it, the veins become swollen and blood is lost, which often leads to death
And for this, do not presume that it is enough to take care of the wound, but rather that one who is skilled in the art, experienced, merciful and patient, should take charge; and that he should use at the outset medicines which do not cause nausea alone, but which will calm the patient, for the patient will be judged by God, not by us; and he should hope for salvation rather than for recovery from the disease, and in which hope there appears some possibility. And so he should strive to reduce it as soon as possible at the outset of the disease, giving only as much caut as is necessary.
And when the limb returns as it should, then administer a regimen which will cause only slight caut and will cure the swelling in that which you agree with the surrounding desiccation.
And if the dislocation is caused by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you perforate the soft tissue of the limb, and do as has been said in the simple diseases of those which precede these
And keep and flee according to your virtue that of the instrument in the way of fear as I have foretold; for what is better for you than the Creator himself? More lasting is his glory, and more joyful is his peace than all the wealth of the world. Thus I finish the words of Albucasim perfectly, for which God be praised. Amen.
