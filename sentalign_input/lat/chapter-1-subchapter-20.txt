On the method of cauterizing softened gums and teeth.
Chapter 22.
When the gums are softened due to excess moisture, causing the teeth to loosen, and medicinal treatments are ineffective, place the patient's head in your lap.
Next, heat a cautery of the following form, place a small tube over the tooth, and quickly insert the heated cautery into the tube. Hold your hand steady for a moment until the patient feels the warmth of the heat reaching the root of the tooth.
Then lift your hand and repeat the cauterization several times as desired.
Then have the patient fill his mouth with saltwater and hold it there for an hour before spitting it out.
The loose tooth will firm up, the softened gums will tighten, and the excessive moisture will dry up.
