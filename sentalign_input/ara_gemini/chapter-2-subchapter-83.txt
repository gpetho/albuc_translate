Chapter eighty-three on images of the instruments that use cupping glasses in diseases of the anus, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or of Chinese porcelain, or of cast or hammered copper.
And this instrument can be made small and large, according to those who use it.
So those used in the treatment of young boys are small.
And those whose anuses are narrow or painful, their syringes should be very gentle.
Picture of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, where the wineskin is attached, should be wide in this manner.
It has a barrier where the wineskin is attached, as you see.
And its lower end, which enters the anus, should be solid, very smooth, and thin; on one of its sides are two holes and on the other side is one hole.
The width of the hole should be the thickness of a probe or a little thicker.
And the wineskin, in which you put the medications, should be made from an animal bladder or from thin sheepskin, made in the shape of a small round tablecloth, its diameter a span, pierced with many holes all around.
And the distance between each hole should be the width of a finger, then you insert into those holes a strong thread of two-ply yarn of ten strands or so.
And you gather the wineskin with it like the tablecloth, so when the medication is placed in it, tighten the top of the syringe between two stones tightly, then inject with it.
And this is a picture of the circle of the wineskin and the hole:
The method of enema is to fill the leather or bladder with the medication, warmed to a degree the patient can tolerate.
And beware that it be too hot or too cold.
Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs up, and a mat or blanket is placed under him.
Then the tip of the enema syringe is lubricated with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar.
Then it is inserted into the anus gently.
Then the attendant takes the syringe with both hands and squeezes it firmly until all of its contents are emptied into the intestine.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medication stimulates him to defecate, he should hold it as long as he can.
And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is most effective in benefit. If it is administered for diarrhea and its expulsion is hastened, the enema should be repeated until he recovers.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the anus, the syringe should be very smooth, smoother than the syringes used for children. This is a picture of a smooth syringe with its leather tightly stretched:
