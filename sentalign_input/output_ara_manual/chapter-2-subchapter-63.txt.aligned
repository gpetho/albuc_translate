On the Incision of a Fleshy Vein and its Treatment.	On cutting for a fleshy hernia and its treatment.	0.8038471
Know that incising this vein is one of the errors leading to death in most cases, therefore, we recommend leaving it alone for safety.  However, I will describe the procedure on it and the types of swelling.	You should know that cutting for this kind of hernia has an uncertain outcome and in most cases results in death; and therefore I think it better to let it be and to safeguard the patient. However, I shall mention the manner of operating for this and all kinds of tumour.	0.7945523
I say that many swellings occur in the testicles, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp humor flowing to the testicles or from a blow.  The color of the swelling is the same as the body's color and there is no fluid in it.	Now I say that many tumours arise from the bodies composing the testicles; and this from several causes. It may be from an acrid superfluity running down into the testicles, or from a blow. The colour of the tumour will be like that of the rest of the body and there is no water to it.	0.83155525
The swelling is hard, and sometimes the swelling is petrified, its color is dark, and it has no feeling.  It may be from a thickening and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from swelling of the veins.  As for what comes from swelling of the arteries, this is known by the dissipation of the swelling.	The lump will be solid and often will be stony hard, of a dark colour, and without sensation. Sometimes also it arises from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as has been mentioned, or from an inflation of the veins.	0.7898845
When you press it with your fingers, it should not change at all. As for what results from swelling of the veins, nothing dissipates from it when pressing with the fingers.  This type can be incised, as well as other fleshy (swellings).	The sort arising from a swelling of the arteries may be recognized by a dispersal of the lump when you press upon it with your fingers; this should not be interfered with at all. The sort arising from a swelling of the vein will not disperse when you press upon it with your fingers.	0.71283054
That is, you incise the skin of the testicle, then pull the testicle upwards and take it out of the white membrane, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after you free it from every side of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to the proliferating tissue.	It is sometimes possible to cut down on this kind and also on the other fleshy tumours thus: make an incision in the skin of the testicles; then draw the testicle upward and out of the tunica albuginea, and free the suspensor from the vessels and tie the vessels, and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all round the testicle.	0.6944716
It is necessary to remove the testicle and cut it off.  And if the adhesion is between some of the membranes or between the vessels, it is necessary to free all of that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.	Should it happen that the testicle is adherent to the fleshy growth, you will have to cut away the testicle itself and remove it. But should the adhesion have formed somewhere inside the membranes or in the space between the vessels, then you must free the adhesion as a whole and cut it away with a circular incision.	0.8205507
If the fleshy growth is in the place of adhesion, which is from behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle, as we have said. When you have finished your work, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	If the fleshy growth should be at the site of the junction which is behind, you will have to cut the whole thing away and remove the testicle as we have said. And when your operation is finished, pack the wound with wool moistened with oil of roses and wine; then dress in the usual manner until healed.	0.9048846
