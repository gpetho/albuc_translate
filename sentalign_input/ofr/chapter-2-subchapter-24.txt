of the flesh over the nose
Sometimes there arise in the nose diverse fleshy growths, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and there are some where there is flesh ingrained with a pale color, and there is soft flesh of good color.
In the case of the flesh that is soft, and not ingrained, you must have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
and open his nostrils, and cast the hook at those fleshy growths, and draw them out;
then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the flesh is entirely removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with one of the subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains;
and if blood overcomes you, or a hot abscess, then treat it as appropriate;
and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then put in clean vinegar and water or wine.
If the nose opens, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that he is healed;
and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is dead flesh on the bone above, which the instrument cannot reach to cut:
then you must put in a rather thick linen thread, knotted by hand, with about a finger's width or less between each knot; 
and have the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as far as he can, and pull it while smelling until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and children in schools often do this, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, tugging on the knots that are in the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have broken down that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all the remaining flesh;
and then put a lead tube in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if drying medications are needed, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And let it be of silver or brass, similar to an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and it should have a handle at the end to hold it when heating the oil or some liquid.
