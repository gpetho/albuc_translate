of back pain	On cauterization for pain in the back.	0.5125172
When pain comes to the back, either by falling or by a blow, or by too great an evacuation, or by some spread of cold matter, for none of these cases is cautery useful, except for the one that comes from the infusion of cold matter.	Many different causes give pain in the back. Sometimes it happens from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation or the like. It may also be due to an influx of humid matter. Cauterization is only to be employed in this last case, which arises from an influx of cold matter.	0.71833503
It is necessary after the patient has been purged with foul-smelling pills or other such, that three lines marked with ink be made on his back where the pain is, and on each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and amount that the patient can bear; and let the cautery be done according to the cautery which is called "points"; and if you wish, make three or four cauteries with a medium key cautery according to this form:	When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength. Use the punctate cautery. If you like, you may give him three or four cauterizations with the middle-sized claviform cautery.	0.83887416
