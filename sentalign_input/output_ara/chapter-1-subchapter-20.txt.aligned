Then heat the cautery, whose image comes after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.	When the gums are relaxed on account of humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat this with drugs, and your treatment is ineffectual, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose picture will come later.	0.89134896
And insert the heated cautery quickly, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand. Then repeat the cautery as many times as you want. Then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water.	Put a cannula upon his tooth and quickly introduce the glowing cautery into it and press a little until the patient can feel the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth; then remove your hand. Then repeat the cauterization as many times as you may desire. Then the patient should fill his mouth with saline, hold it for a while, then spit it out.	0.8797277
And he should hold it for a while and then spit it out. The loose teeth will become firm, and the loose gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry.	Then the loose tooth will be made firm, the relaxed gum will be tightened, and the corrupt humidity will be dried up.	0.6906581
