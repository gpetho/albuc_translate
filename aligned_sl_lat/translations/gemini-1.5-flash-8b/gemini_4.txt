Having completed this book for you, children, which is the last of the medical sciences with its complement, and having reached its end through its expositions and its own declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery, with the hand.
Since the practice of manual operation has been neglected in our region and in our time, quite private, until perhaps its knowledge has perished, and its trace has been severed, and nothing has remained of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions were closed, and its power was removed, it seemed to me that I should revive it by the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation, and to present the forms of cautery instruments and other operation instruments, with the addition of declarations and the haste required.
The reason why a good craftsman with his hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen described, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their shapes, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, tendons, and their number, and their exits, and the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
And for that reason Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, but with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken of that in the introduction of this book.
Since whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy is not deterred from falling into an error by which people are killed, as I have seen many of those who are trained in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
This is because I saw a foolish physician incise a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and cut some arteries in her neck; therefore, the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who dared to remove a stone from an old man, and the stone was large.
So he reached it and removed it with a piece of the bladder.
Therefore, the man died on the third day.
And I myself had already been called to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the sick man that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel; and the physician, in his ignorance, hastened and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Afterwards, he dismissed him after a few days, and instructed him not to loosen the bandage; and he remained like that until his leg and foot became an abscess and reached destruction.
I was therefore summoned to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and there followed tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
However, the corruption had already become firmly established in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated the cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after days, until its evil increased with its owner.
This is because, when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb which can tolerate having the whole of it cut off.
And therefore, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that surgical operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation to which health is associated; and operation with which there is danger in many dispositions. And I have already aroused in every place of this book, in which operation comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to beware of it, and to cut it off, so that fools may not find a way to speak and dishonor it.
Therefore, take your measures with care and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better path leading through God's grace to health and a praiseworthy succession: and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your advantage. For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and ultimately to your rewards.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad doctor.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of cautery: and for which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron, or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I recount the operation with it, it is necessary for me to speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in which constitution it should be applied.
I say, therefore, that discussion of the quality of the benefit and harm of cautery is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a matter of knowledge and hidden secret.
Many wise men have spoken on this topic, and they disagreed: and to me, a little from their words suffices, fearing length.
Therefore, I say that cautery benefits every constitution, whether with matter or without matter, except for the two constitutions which are a hot constitution without matter and a dry constitution without matter.
However, they disagreed on the hot and dry constitution with matter.
For some said that cautery is helpful in it.
And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in a sickness that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable for a sickness from heat and dryness to be healed with heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite stated that through cautery help is given in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I myself, through his statement, say that experience has shown me this several times.
However, it should not be applied unless one is already proven and skilled in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and has learned the diversity of human constitutions, and the nature of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their effects, and the duration of their course.
However, there is no fear regarding the other constitutions, and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all physicians have already agreed on them, and have not disagreed concerning the help of cautery in them.
And know, children, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except to the member that is cauterized, and does not harm another member joined with it, except by a small harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches what is remote from the members, and perhaps causes an illness of difficult healing in the member, and perhaps kills it.
However, fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
However, this has become known to us through experience, on account of the length of our service and study of the art, and our standing upon the truth of things; and for this reason I am excused from the length of this discourse.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be applied, and they propose a better time for the verisimilar.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm, being accidental, is submerged in the benefit which is attracted with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a greater harm will occur than the small harm that transpires because of the time.
And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely, that the ailment cured by cautery does not always return.  And they posit that as a consequence, but the matter is not as they think.  Because cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries up the humours which are the causes of why the pains occur.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in the swiftness of its recovery, and the strength of its action, and the vehemence of its dominion.  And it is possible that the illness may return at some hour of time according to the complexion of the ill person, and the location of his illness, and its strength, and what is prepared in his body from the gathering of superfluities in him, and what reaches him in his acquisition from foods and the like of such causes, unless it is a disease in which cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a limb, from few superfluities and moistures, like toothache, because of pain, and similar to it, it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly, the common people's assertion that cautery is the final medicine is correct, not in what they intend by that, because they believe it is not a cure comparable to medicine, nor anything else after the cautery has subsided.
However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the final medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of treatment in some illnesses, and those medicines are not successful, then we administer cautery at the end, and it does work; then it falls out that cautery is the final medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that the cautery site does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely so, because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you are making a cautery in fire from gold, it is not clear to you when the fire is according to the quantity you want, because of the redness of the gold.  And when it hastens to cooling, and if you add more fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls from that occupation, and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us, due to its suitability for the operation.
And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters, and arranged them from head to foot, so that they might alleviate the seeker who desires something from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization benefits against the dominion of moisture and cold over the brain, which two are causes of headache, and a multitude of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally, every illness that occurs from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is, that you instruct the sick person to be evacuated first with a cleansing, dissolving medicine, cleaning the head for three nights, or four, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his habit.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands squared, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger arrives, mark that place with the cautery. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, whose form is this. Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, so that your hand is gradually constricted, and you will revolve it.
Then raise your hand quickly, and look at the place.
If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then raise your hand.
And if not, repeat with the iron itself, or with another from it if it grows cold, until the bones appear, which I told you.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it over the place, and leave it for three days.
Then place the soaked cloth in butter, and leave it over the place, until the scab of fire is destroyed. Then treat it with the tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and that the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then that which is burned from the bone should be scraped off, then treated.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it makes an impression in the bone, such that the bone falls away, which happens like a kirate form, or an instrument that women use with a small alphabet infusion; and they believe that vapors from the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it is healed.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in some people, according to the path of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better for his health.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the infirm is naturally weak, and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore, operate with it for health.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the entire head.
Chapter 3.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it prolongs itself in the sick person, and they use leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and poultices.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery that we have described, and none of those things helps him, then consider.
For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and encounters severe cold, then cauterize with another cautery under the first slightly.
Then cauterize it over every horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is not exposed.
And cauterize it with a single cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the *vas*, which is the place where the cupping vessel is placed; and elevate your cautery here and do not expose the bone.
For the sick person experiences great pain because of that, different from the pain of the other cauterizations on all parts of the head.
And I will say this: The cautery should be in its proper place; and it should be the cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a finer cautery than that used for the middle of the head.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a hemicrania, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment is administered, as I stated in the divisions of illnesses, and yet that does not provide a complete cure: then cauterization is performed in it in two ways: either with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron. The cautery with a burning, sharp medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then, open the painful area at the time, with a wide lancet, until a place under the skin is made, where the clove is placed.
Then introduce it into the place under the skin until it is hidden; then bind it above with a suitable constriction of lint, and leave it for fifteen hours; then release it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterward, place on it a poultice soaked in butter until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
However, its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
The cautery iron, whose shape is this.
And it is called a "clavilus" because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle is a small prominence.
Then place it upon the area, and hold your hand; and you revolve the iron gradually with speed; and the amount that is burned should be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery below is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak the cloth in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter; afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife edge.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an ancient one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an ancient hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When treating hemicrania, along with what we have said in the previous treatment, and what we have stated in the divisions of illnesses, and if treatment does not help, and you see from the illness that what we said of the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is insufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it whitens after you have marked the area of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or nearly that; and place your hand on one side, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the side or the nerve that moves the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest a spasm result.
And be on guard, and careful of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
For in its cutting is the danger, especially for the one who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not diligent nor skilled; and he abandons the operation in the first place.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for the flow of blood arising from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
If you see, from the illness, that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we spoke of in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two blades.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Chapter VI. When earache occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and the other treatment that we described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire; and it is that which is called the "Punctum," whose form is this.
Then, after its ignition, touch the points around the entire ear, as it revolves; or around each, if the pain is in both ears simultaneously.
And move the cautery a short distance away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink; and the amount of cauterization should be ten points in each ear, and like that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a twisting motion.
Chapter VII.
The twisting that is treated with cauterization is only from the types that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases. And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from desiccation and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of twisting with poultices, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment is of no benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted in three places: one near the root of the ear, a second somewhat lower from its time, and a third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the affected part.
Because softening does not occur, unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the upper extremity of the ear under the horn of the head a little, and another in the temple, whose length should be according to the length of a thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of one from the knife, whose form was previously mentioned; however, it is not any thinner than a little, as you see, and it is necessary that the knife within it have a little superfluous thickness. Then treat the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient Apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When the apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of his head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of his head, according to what preceded; and the method of the cautery shall be according to what preceded.
A cautery is also applied to the mouth of the stomach; and this is more extreme.
Then he should be treated with what preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Oblivion.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the drink be given first to the sick large hyerae, and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on the back of his head a plaster of mustard described in the treatise on plasters: and place it several times. For this is indeed the method of the cautery, and do it according to the same order that I have said there. If, therefore, it is cured by it, it is good.
If not, then make three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cautery, with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the weak man is able to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle.
If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form which was stated before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hygeirs, and with what we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over every horn of the head, and with a cautery over its back, and with three over the vertebrae of the neck.
If, however, in the sickness you need to soften the body with more than those, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery until most of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed: and thus the cautery of Olive.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment which we have stated in the division, when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant of the taking of medicines.
However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle, and mastications that cleanse the brain, are administered, many days beforehand, along with a good dietary improvement.
Then shave his head, afterward cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has preceded in the manner, and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on each horn of his head.
If however the sick person is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have described for someone with paralysis, and for the softening of the body over the spinal vertebrae of the neck and back, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method that has preceded. If however the sick person is a child, then place a thin cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have stated for someone with paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess sloping towards melancholy, and the body of the sick person is moist, then give him in a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a neatly crafted little roll of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and the sick person, seated upright, should be held secure on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is best made from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, such that a finger can tolerate it when inserted into it.
Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once every week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, beyond which you should hold the cauterizing instrument: indeed, let it be smelled.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place upon it a poultice soaked in butter, or hen's fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs, which I have said in the division, then begin and let the weak one drink, with that which will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all dampness, and have him sit in a bath, fasting for some days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if there is the beginning of a descent of water in both eyes at once: or from one side, if there is the beginning of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be of such length as the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries finally applied.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the ancient Lachrymis.
Chapter Fourteen.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant, and are upon the veins and arteries that are in the manifest exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have described in the inception of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if it needs addition, then cauterize it on every side of the eye cautiously, upon the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the foul odor of the Nose.
Chapter Fifteen.
When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; then hurry, and give the weakened one concoctions in drink for three nights; afterwards shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a claviform cautery, two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the shape of the claviform cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this lunate cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not put your hand with the cautery to the very end, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
And this is the shape of the cautery according to this method of lunate cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs grow inward, stinging the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery is in it according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, first advise the sick person to remove his hairs, if he is of those who clean them, until they are elongated and equal. If, however, they sting him at their origin: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born.
When therefore they are born and equal, then place the head of the sick person on your lap: then mark above the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a sign which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Then place a cot moistened in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape which you marked gradually in many turns, until the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely and properly burned.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment, until it heals.
If any hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then cauterize that place again, as you did at first.
If the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place, and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
On the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
You should instruct the sick person to allow the hairs to drop out until they are elongated and even.
Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Then take from known soap, and from unabsorbed lime, each a weight of one ounce, or nearly so: then grind them together with good rubbing, and do it quickly, lest it cool.
Then take a piece of that, from it, over the paper that you made like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or of two.
And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white; and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while.
And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the biting of the medicine, because its biting is found to be like fire.
While therefore this biting which he finds lasts, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised upon contraction with fire, or with an incision, it is good; and if not, then again apply medicine to the area where the medicine does not imprint, and does not darken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the utmost guard, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something fights from the hairs into the eye, then again medicate that place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a study of this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, in accordance with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if your treatment does not help, then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move nor shake with his head.
Then place a cotum infused in the white of an egg, or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be held upwards in this way.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, made very hot, upon it.
And hold it with your hand near the cautery, from the eye, to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not wander, or the sick person is not disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you arrive at the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, it will be good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed. If however forty days have passed, and it is not healed: then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the mouth is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first ones said.
Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, and split it open; then place in that fissure a fine camahan, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this.
And pour into it a drachma's worth of melted lead, and hold your hand with the retention cannula well, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a poultice steeped in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the location of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nostril opening, and to redirect the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will return to its proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Chapter XX.
Fissures, called "pili", frequently occur in the lip, especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and if treatment is not effective, then apply a small knife cauterium to the wound, in this manner.
And its concavity should be according to the thinness of the knife.
Then treat it with a cauterant until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then it produces pus and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then if you treat it and the treatment does not work, then it is necessary that you cauterize the cauterium according to the size that is in the fistula.
Then introduce it [the cauterium] ignited into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and its utmost point; do it once or twice.
Then treat it afterward, with what we said about treatment until it is cured.
If, therefore, the pus is separated and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come to its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then, using a cautery, whose form will come after this, place the cannula over the tooth: and quickly introduce the heated cautery into it: and hold your hand for a short while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire having already reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and let him spit it out.
For the moving tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to cold, either cold or a worm is in it, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Its cautery with butter is that you should take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel.
Then take a bit of cotton, and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron upon it, until fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Its cauterization with fire is to aim for a copper cannula, or an iron cannula. And let there be something of its thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's mouth.
Then take a cautery, whose form shall be as follows, and place it upon that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do it a few times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or another day.
And it is necessary, in the impression of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour; then spit it out.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity you are able; and this is the form of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Strophules.
Chapter XXIV.
When Strophules are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and their digestion is slow; then cauterize with a concave cautery, whose form is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may issue from the cautery from the other end; and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time, if it does not suffice, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice steeped in butter, until that which the fire has burned away is removed.
Then treat it with a tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula is healed.
On the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice, and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When humidities overcome the pulmonary passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the sick person be first evacuated with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it in the noxious place near the root of the throat in a depressed area; and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck in the last vertebra of it, finishing it off; and let the cautery be narrow according to the method that went before.
Then treat it with what went before, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and disease of the lungs are from cold humours, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the disease is long-standing: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in depressed, smooth, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a tube according to the form that went before.
And if your desire is for cauterization by puncturing with a cautery, which is called a "Punctum," whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to as if another.
Then treat him with what went before, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore, the cauterization is alleviated when you do it with three cauteries in one turn.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not fix itself at the time of returning from its dislocation, until such time as it is accustomed to returning, and then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Then the sick person should be laid on their back, or on their healthy side.
Then lift the skin which is in the inner Titillico towards the upper part with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then, having a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the thread.
And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added to this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place upon the cautery bruised leeks with salt.
Then cause the sick person to adhere to stillness, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and rarely does that happen, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture happen in the stomach, until they draw it away from its complexion, and phlegms multiply in it, and constant methods of treatment do not help, then it is necessary that the sick person lie on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery under the spoon-shaped part of the chest, the size of a finger, with a cautery-knife, and two cauteries below it, on either side of the first, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And lengthen them between each other so that they do not join, when they will cause pus. And let the depth of the cautery be the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form, and let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the shape of a circle, according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for one who is terrified by this cautery; and it is, as if you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity you wish with ink; then cauterize it with a cautery of the point; then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
Of the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When in the liver pain occurs from coldness and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion through the expulsion of superfluities, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their back, and mark with ink three cauteries according to this shape and this same quantity on the lower liver, from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches: and let the space that is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity that is burned be, in thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it, not added; and let the sick person be standing on their feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, so that the whole body is burned, and reaches the intestines; because the skin there is thin, so know this.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter Thirty.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its covering: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the liver's covering, there is intense pain with sharpness: and you see already that the treatment has tired its physicians.
Therefore, the sick person should lie on their neck.
Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then heat the cauterium, which is made like a ray.
And this is its shape.
And cauterize with it, one cauterium, until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for exits, until it is healed.
And one should not use this type of cauterium unless their study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and by whose hands such illnesses have met with experience many times; then only may they dare on such an operation.
But truly, to abandon it, is better for me.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleuritis.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said, a cauterium with aristolochia roots for a cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is, that you receive from the dry long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the others, which is found from it, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil; and ignite it in fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping down on the part that is under the beard.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib sloping slightly towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be in the evident skin smelling. And certain ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron like a rod: and they ignite it, and insert it within that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess itself, and pus comes out: as we said in the case of an abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat an illness of the spleen, in accordance with what we have said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is applied to it in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of these is to make three cauteries, or four, by drawing lines along the length of the spleen, in the shape of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded.
And let the distance between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be the same as we described for the cautery of the liver.
And do not press your hand hard on the cautery: and let the infirm person lie supine on their back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and raise the skin, which is directly above the spleen, where the left elbow of the sick person reaches; and let your elevation of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then care for the cautery after you allow it to emit pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the previous treatments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have stated in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and a cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and with one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be approximately equal to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not discharge the weak person from treatment after the cautery with him: because it is necessary that two intentions be united in him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be a nail-like shape, according to its previous form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter Thirty-Four.
When abscesses appear in a hydrops patient, and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot, in the nocrati, which is between the auriculare and anulare [tendons/areas]; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will drain, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then, make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like tip of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries on each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time so that some water will drain from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have described.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the case of abdominal distention. Chapter 35.
When the abdominal distention is due to cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of cure, but is not healed; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of great potency, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a fine, claw-like cautery; and a large cautery on the hypochondriac region, or two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the sick person tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the pubic bone, and a cautery on each buttock; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial cure, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back, a little below the navel, in a triangular shape, and with a cautery under the navel, as if by two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food does not digest, and you see his face suppurate, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a cautery blade: and leave the cautery open for a time: then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery that is similar to a ray.
Then introduce the heated cautery into the excised althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, through which blood flows: do this once, or twice. If therefore there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Then treat them with what is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more useful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
When the patient does not respond to the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured by cauterization.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humors.
Therefore, it is more fitting that you probe it with a thin probe.
Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the extent to which the cautery entered. And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder, or to the intestine, then guard yourself from all of these locations.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the area until it is healed.
If however the area is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if they do not cut away materials from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt bone is within its depth, or something similar to that: whose mention will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold, or from heavy wind, and it lessens on account of that of the infirm person, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the almethen, over the kidneys themselves, cauterizing over each kidney with a clauili cautery, the mention of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the same almedate.
Therefore three lines will come.
Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter XL. When weakness and softening of the bladder occur from cold and dampness, to the point where the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit, and another from the left: and let the length of that cauterization on each side be according to the size of a thumb's knot; and cauterize it with a cautery of the lower back, or with two cauteries, if that is needed; and let it be according to the preceding cautery's closure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus. Chapter XLI.
When cold and dampness occur in the uterus, and it is prevented from conception, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above and slightly below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be as before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humors discharge into the anus, and become the cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of that is that one leg is prolonged over the other, when compared together; and the site of dislocation is found vacant in it.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the affected area above the anus itself with a similar circular cautery; after you mark it with ink around the anus, as it revolves; and that the anus itself falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the same form as that used in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness; and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to relieve the patient from the thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is that you cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good or bad depth.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, cauterization is done in the middle over the head of the hip itself.
Therefore, there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one, so that there should be a circle containing the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, on the spot where the infirm person points there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the ankle four fingers towards the wild part a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the infirm person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he points with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
And if he indicates pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery so as to burn a nerve or a major artery, and thereby bring upon the infirm person bad harm, or contraction.
And I myself have seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in their cauterization, and the leg has become swollen, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole was perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then the dissolution of the abdomen and death followed thereafter.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men said in cauterizing the hip, of which this is the method of cautery.
Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or slightly less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space between each cautery be the size of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be about one knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-box of the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries in one turn.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, with this type of cautery, O children, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we have found few who will wait upon it.
However, it is a good cautery for him who endures it, and finds its place with it.
A cautery, however, with burning medicines, is that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which descends a gate hinge of it from bronze or iron, the length of a wall, whose height they may have two knots, or as if themselves.
And let the space that is between each be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above, and let them contain each other, according to this form.
Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick man lying on his healthy side.
And press your hand upon the box of ashes greatly.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for a quantity of an hour of time, and let the sick man tolerate its burning, and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe the hot water from the whole ash with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
And place butter upon it, until the blackness of the cauterization is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it.
For it is the last in help.
Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, according to what you did for the ash equally.
And this is the method of warm water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, both of one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part is pierced with one small hole, according to the amount that the radius will enter: and place under the bottom of the pot another glass pot: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger: after which you compress them with your hand with good pressure: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over more lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is used in many surgical operations, and in the cauterization of other limbs.
Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
And from the medicines with which the anus, also like the testicles, and honey of anacardium, and lime with soap, are cauterized, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which the pain of the anus and sciatic vein were cured: and he greatly praised its effectiveness.
And he said that it did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed in a single instance, until he related that perhaps he had entered a bath carried and emerged from it already healthy. And it is to be taken from fresh seitaragi: and if fresh is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and let it be ground much with a little fat, and placed on the anus, where there is pain, or the leg, or the thigh: and let it be bound, and let it be left for a quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the sick person feels the abatement of the burning.
Then put him in a bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, put him on a couch.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that it is not necessary for someone to use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who spoke of this, said that the dung of goats, when a sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cauterization is done in this way.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place, which is between the big toe and the lesser toe, and is closer to the lesser toe.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it upon the wool, and let it be until it is extinguished.
Then do it again.
Therefore do not cease to do this, until the feeling in the intervening space reaches the ankle, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
Concerning the cautery of back pain.
Chapter XLIV.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident, or from a blow, or from the evacuation of superfluities, and things similar to these, from the infusion of cold and damp matter: and indeed cautery does not apply, except in this single type, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the evacuation of the patient with foul pills and things similar, to be applied to the back where the pain is, three lines should be made according to the width of the patient's back.  After marking with ink five cauteries on each line, or more according to the tolerance of the patient's strength, cauterization should be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a medial, cleft cautery, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of humpback.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often occurs in very young infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that there is a constriction in their breathing during lifting and movement; and you find in the lowest thoracic vertebrae and their nodules that it has already begun to project above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, in this form.
And let the cautery cover the entire part of the vertebra evenly; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines of punctures, and let the punctures be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, lest you administer the cautery to the hump that arises from a nerve spasm.
Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains. Chapter XLVI.
When joint pains are from cold humors that are poured out to any limb of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is to cauterize it after evacuation, in a circuit around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
This is its form.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do so with a puncturing cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and that happens often, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with this same clavi-shaped cautery. If, however, more of this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said concerning the cautery in its chapter.
If, however, the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the focus, like two lines revolving.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, over each knot, and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not evacuate the sick person from good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
For if a good regimen is undertaken and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the spermatic cord, descends to the testicle, and it is a beginning, close proximity: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to give up eating on his day.
And that he use laxatives, so that feces descend from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands upon his back: and command him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture over the pubic bone, with a sign whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then cauterize with a cautery, whose form this is, until it comes white and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its concavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the location, so that the intestine does not escape: and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery upon that mark, your hand holding the cautery upright.
And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or again with it another time, if you have not reached the mouth with it on the first try.
And carefully watch for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn it, and that death or great harm does not come to the sick person through it.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is not successful.
And the cautery for infants should be small, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you provide nourishment for the duration of his treatment, that will soothe his stomach, so that the intestine does not discharge during attempts at defecation.
Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete recovery.
When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining abdomen, and are incipient, and the strength is such that they should not be added to, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which is cauterized be thus as a third of it.
Then treat it with what we said: and it will not be added to.
And now some early ones have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with the key-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or a blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When in some limbs pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cautery on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to the one adjacent to it.
Therefore, it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the diseased part is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
And especially the species of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider that.
If the leprosy is obstinate, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it has neither subsided nor ceased; and you fear that the corruption might spread throughout the entire constitution of the afflicted person: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the forehead, and a second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two temples, and one behind at the base of the neck.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it creates a small indentation in the opening, and the crusts are loosened; so that the expulsion of thick vapors from it may be eased, and cauterize the spleen with the cautery as previously mentioned.
However, if the leprosy has already spread over the afflicted person and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with the cauteries that we mentioned for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunches near the tailbone and one on it, in the actual buttock; and with two on the hips; namely, one on each hip, and with two on the knees; one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the joints of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them. And sometimes a cautery is applied to the breastbone, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more helpful and beneficial it is.
And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be of various sizes, both large and small, according to the limbs and joints, in accordance with what has preceded concerning types of instruments.
Chapter L.
When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what is deserved by the magnitude or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery enter into the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain numbness which happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs, and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When the Albaras is old and no remedy from the arts of medicine helps it, then cauterize upon it itself with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its colour is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each one part: let these all be mixed, and applied to a cloth, and adhere to the place, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Chapter LII.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as if revolving.
However, the learned have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem to me, because I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have already seen that happen several times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturing, whether due to excess causing it, or due to the age of the infirm person, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or due to the time and need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish a perforation of it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from the one following the infirm person, so that the course of pus may be alleviated.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a malignant corrosive. Chapter LIII.
A corrosive is nothing other than corruption in a limb that walks, and corrodes it; as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then cauterize it many times with small and large cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days, and apply ground sulfur with oil to the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh grows, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remained of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured by corroding medicine.
For it rises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of more rapid help; and indeed I have already said that its cauterization with corroding medicine is in division; therefore, take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in warts and corns. Chapter LV.
Often this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, filtered substance that hurts the foot. And cautery in them is indeed in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, make a concave cautery resembling a vulture's wing, to be made of iron, according to the size that encompasses the wart from every side, and have fine edges.
Then place it, heated, over the wart. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the wart until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply a plaster to it with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight. It will indeed be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And it is as if you take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's quill; and place it on the wart, or corn.
Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand steady, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula presses into the root of the wart, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the wart.  And let the sick person wait a little while on the biting of the hot water for one hour.
Then leave it, for the wart is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with each of them, one by one, until you reach all that are on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Trembling.
Chapter LVI.
When trembling occurs in someone from cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
For trembling ceases with the cautery of olive oil, and the health of the cold illness hastens. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul Albathir, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made from myrtle wood, whose tip is ignited with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they are not increased; and the superfluity causing them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Often a flow of blood occurs from an artery that is cut in a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a limb, and things similar to them: and it is difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is stopped beneath your finger, and nothing escapes from it. Then place small olive-shaped cauteries, and many larger ones, in the fire: and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the bleeding is stopped.
If it escapes when you lift your finger from the artery's opening, and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire. Therefore, do not cease to do this with one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and cause another harm to the sick person. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it; especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Or put on it medicines of properties, which are to cut off the blood, and be tied with a suitable constricting cushion.
He however who administers its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the placement of burning things, and similar things, does not benefit it completely, except rarely.
If however that should happen to someone, and a physician is not present for him, nor medicine: then let him begin with the placement of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and with a strong constriction of it, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger is not to be removed, over it with very cold, cold water constantly, until the blood is congealed, and thickened, and severed. And meanwhile let him consider in it what it needs from cautery, or from medicine.
End of the First Part.
Book of Surgery of Albucasis, Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already said in the first chapter that every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path: that the seeker may be relieved of his quest. And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, children, that in this chapter there is a terror similar to that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, for in the operation that is in this chapter, often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a passageway, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which tremor and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes in this art the ways of men come together with the ways of illnesses.
For among them is one who is angered by his illness, and death is easy for him, because of the intensity of what he finds in his sickness and its prolonged malice.
And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
And among them is one who gives his payment, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful. Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which praiseworthy succession has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick people, prognostication and indication of that to which health may suitably be.
For in that is your help concerning the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, children, with his intellect, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration, for it is in his hand.
And I indeed have arranged this Chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the Chapter on Cauterization, from the neck up to the feet, so that your inquiry concerning it, and what you need, may be lightened.
Concerning the treatment of water which collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightly compresses the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And truly I have not seen this illness in others than children, and death swiftly followed all whom I saw afflicted by it; therefore, it seemed to me fitting to omit treatment for it.
And indeed I saw a child among them whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone above the surface.
And if the treatment is for moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a single incision in the middle of the head, with a width of one breadth, and the length of the incision should be about two spans, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of a lancet.
If therefore the moisture has increased more, and the abscess is larger, then place two incisions, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and that is not hidden from you: then you should make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this method.
And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Then apply a poultice of wine and oil over it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound tightly.
And give the sick person any dry food with little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, proceed with the incision where the abscess and accumulation of water appear to you, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When cataracts occur in someone's eyes or chest, and it is prolonged and medicine does not help, then the final treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary that the sick person shave his head.
Then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Then the sick person should tighten his neck with any cloth of his.
Then consider where the vein beats.
And the places of both are the places that are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with ink each one: and cut each one with a lancet on each side, the incision reaching the bone: and let that be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the lancet under the artery and cut it upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating outflow, which leaps to the interior with frequent leaps.
If however the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a quantity of space of three fingers.
Then mark with ink and split it until the mouth [opening].
And that which is necessary to emit from the blood, is VI ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less. All of that according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the weak person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if anything remains at the mouth from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then constrict the wound with bandages made from linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from a chronic headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors, and heat in the temple muscles, or a severe, chronic ailment, and is treated with the usual methods of medicine and it does not help, then we are experienced in these illnesses in extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the infirm person should shave the hair that is in the temples, and direct the attention to the artery appearing in the temple.
For it is indeed shown to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by the severity of cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the sick person hold their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or apply steam to the place with warm water, until it appears to you in a clear way. Then take the spatula, which I have made a little before. Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tissues that are under it on every side.
If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut a portion from it according to the amount by which its ends will lengthen and contract, and so that no blood flow occurs.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend completely. Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk, or of alhohod cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur at the wound before it heals, and blood flow does not happen.
Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut off, and it will remain in the place of the same work.
And it is a better work, unless if the sick person has a fever, or is of a heated temperament.
Because cautery is from those things that help in finishing humidities.
Therefore, it is a better aid.
And it is necessary, after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old lint: and pads properly made be placed upon it.
And after the removal, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If meanwhile, during your work, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then quickly cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with zegi: and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off.
If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the area until the blood clots.
And embrocate the place with water of great coldness, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as is necessary.
And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Because if they are sharp, like two knives, the cold hastens both of them: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with ink: and place both of them heated strongly, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that the distance between its extremities is extended.
For they do not consolidate completely with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Concerning the treatment of persistent, acute tear flow from the eyes.
Chapter Four.
When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from veins situated on the outer surface of the skull, and medicine with medicaments does not contribute to their cure, and you see the patient's face already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs of their rims are already corroded; and his eyelids are inflamed by the severity of the tears; then the ancients resorted to this operation in their treatment, and they named this treatment, with a Knife.
And it is, that you should instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead; and let the length of each incision be approximately two fingers; and let one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly offset from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side; and be careful not to cut the arteries which are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the size of three fingers joined together; and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dry cloths, with which you may absorb the blood.
Then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is the form.
From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision; and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions, with that which is above the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, one side smooth, not sharp, on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision is continued up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from the fragments of coagulated blood. Then place in every fissure a linen cloth made of old cotton, and place on top of them cushions soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day loosen the ligature, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs befall someone, and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, piercing pain in the depths of the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these occurrences that those matters, and catarrhs, do not come except from numerous veins.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is that you should command the sick person to shave his forehead.
Then make one incision in the middle of his forehead, or another slightly wider one, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision reach to the bone: and withdraw your hand from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Then bind it from above with small pads: and soak the pads with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess may not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen which causes flesh to grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of rosin: and prepare a plaster from them, and it is administered for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear. Chapter VI. Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from those which are not added, nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, then instill into the ear something from violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then administer its extraction, and make it sneeze with condiments, and occlude the nostrils at the coming of the sneeze, after you place around the ear fragments of cloths or wool, and extend the ear upward.
For it often goes out with this treatment.
If however it does not go out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, with thin pliers: whose form is this.
If therefore it goes out with the pliers, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a thin, single-hooked, slightly forked implement. If therefore it does not go out by that, then make a tube of bronze, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear canal deeply, and plug that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for wind except through the tube; then extract with your wind by strong suction. For often it goes out with that which we have related.
If however it does not go out this way, then take from helkalimbat, or from viscus, that is, prepared gluten, with which birds are caught, a small amount; and place it at the tip of the radius after you have wrapped a suitable bandage around it; then introduce it into the ear canal with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not go out with all that we have described, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is, that phlebotomize the weak first in the cephalic vein; and draw from him blood according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the infirm sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near his fat in a depressed area there: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Then stitch the incision from your hour with speed, and care for it until it is healed.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If, however, it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, slender spatula, of this form.
And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain, which falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you have placed many small pieces; then extract them with hooks, or with a thin instrument, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thereby alleviated.
However, in water that enters the ear, the afflicted person should first use sneezing; and he should fill his ear with some old cotton; and he should lie on the ear in which the water is.
If, therefore, it comes out through it, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the afflicted person insert one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him jump on his foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone that is in the ear.
Therefore, let him not cease to do that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
And now, when the water comes out, take one from papyrus or reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then take another reed, and do this many times, until all the water comes out; and extract it with a cannula, according to what was said previously concerning the stone.
In the extraction of an animal that has entered it, if it is small, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large size, apparent to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all things that are held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore something of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this: narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and insert the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates it; then suck with a strong suction.
Do this repeatedly, until all the worms emerge.
If, however, they do not yield to you for exit, then coat the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the section on stones.
If they do not emerge with what we have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already used in the killing of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application of oils and medications into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, in which there is a small hole, wider at the top.
Let the pusher, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze well-made.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap linen at its end with a proper wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medication you desire, into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the rod with the linen from above, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the hearing, and the patient feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear, let it be warmed a little with fire; and beware that the substance which is distilled into it is not excessively cold; for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of accidental ear blockage.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it happens also to some people that the ear canal is blocked by a wound, or flesh growing in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, and is not seen; and sometimes it happens near the outside of the canal, and is seen.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the sight does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to cure.
And in that which is seen, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it.  Then if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a thin probe, whose shape is as follows: the tip should have a small width, and a sharp edge; and the rest of the probe should have two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
If therefore the blockage is from flesh growing in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook, and cut it away with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod, and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you sense a blockage with the patient's impaired hearing, attempt its opening with ease, and beware lest you injure the nerves of the ear.
Then apply a bandage to the ear, according to the size of the opening, wrapped in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Or take a bandage, soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle ground zegi on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has already suppurated, then it is necessary to remove the bandage, and apply another bandage wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and place it over the ear, and use the other treatment, which stops the flow of blood, as described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of the eye lids.
Chapter VIII. These swellings that occur in the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must grasp them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Then place a pounded astringent on the area.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something happens in the eyelids that resembles granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called a granulation: and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
The operation on them therefore is, that you should consider then, if it is a granulation progressing in that which appears on the eyelid, and they move in every direction, and its removal is easy.
Therefore, make a fissure over it, to the width.
Then scrape it away from every side with ease, until it is removed.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
If, however, its removal is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If, however, the fissure is large, then gather it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and makes it flesh.
And if the granulation is sloping inwards towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid and suspend the granulation with a hook; besides that, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the granulation's incision, with salt water: and treat the place with that which makes it flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the eyelashes.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid; and it most often happens to children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they suffer from catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because their tears rush to them, and because of this, you see them always lying on their faces, and sleeping on them. Their eyelids, which are already swollen, are damp beneath the eyebrows.  The prominence of the Axirnath is evident to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of operation is that the sick person should place their head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare a string on it, and make a circle out of that string according to the amount that Axirnath contains on every side.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, incisions by the width, and let the incision not be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut through the whole skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many positions the Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore, extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside: and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and be careful not to add to the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and injure it.
However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little to the incision with ease, until the Axirnath comes forth.
Then extract it, as we have said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with bandages.
And among men are those who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that the remaining moisture may liquefy.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, causing it to wrinkle in an improper manner.
Chapter XI.
When extra hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural lashes, and persist: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and white discoloration, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured by four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Or by canes, according to what I will say.
You should place the patient's head in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the hairs, adding with a spatula proceeding from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth: then mark above the eyelid with ink, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it varies in humans.
For among them is one who needs that a large quantity be cut from the eyelid, according to the quantity softened by the eyelid. Then, with a spatula, find above the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the fissure be near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then scrape it all. Then bring together the two lips with a suture, using a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what remains of thread over the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not bother.
Then leave the suture and threads until three or four days; afterwards treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
For the eyelid is lifted at the sealing and bringing together of the wound: but it will be better.
This method of treatment the ancients taught.
However, there is concern for the infirm, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted.
Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal cutting.
However, if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal to it: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather together the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation: and raise the skin over which the sign is placed, as we have recounted.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures: and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with caeroto, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid, that its hairs turn.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is necessary to turn the eyelid, and to cut the fissure that is within, according to what I have narrated.
Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of the spatula; and you have now incised at the extremities of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly bind the two reeds on both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for a few days. For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then treat it until it heals.
When it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The procedure in it is that you should take a slender needle, and introduce into it a fine, soft silk thread. Then tie its ends, and make a very small knot at each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place another fine thread under it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place their head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation may be clear; for it is a subtle or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up over the alinxotati: and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati from the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled out and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then you shall pull the alinxotati and the thread; and remove both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it; or leave it until it lengthens after a period, and then lift it.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Therefore, the accidental one arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
And the method of operation in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place on that which is between them a linen lint, and tie it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed, use in it things that soften, such as Greek hay; and embrocate with water in which althea, flaxseed, have been cooked; and with the unguent dyaquilon, liquefied with some oil; and wrap with it a linen lint, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is to try with all ingenuity that it does not consolidate, according to the form it had at first.
And this operation which we have stated is only a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was entirely. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs below, is that which is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental kind is caused by a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and things similar to these.
And the method of operating on it is to take a needle, on which a double thread is fastened, and to pierce it into the flesh, and to cause it to penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a rod, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is formed from them: until, when they come together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said, of softening medicines, and poultices, until they are healed.
And if an Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a poultice, according to what we said.
And the summary of the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrati.
For it has many varieties of form, and a prudent craftsman prepares an approach with whatever method is possible to him, until he makes the shape return to its natural form, or near it, and the afflicted person himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not have the sharpness of other spatulas, but rather be slightly blunt, so the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and does not injure the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be as if you were gently peeling away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distill it into it from a vessel made of dissolved zinc with water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with flax thread; and place on the eye wool soaked with egg white; and after three days use the vessel, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of the tear flesh.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is nervous and is similar to hard, fine skin.
Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is severed and the hook does not become fixed in it.
And both species do not begin, unless from the greater tear duct, until it proceeds gradually, until it covers the sight, and hinders the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail with a few-fold hook, and extend it upward.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fasten it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upward: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you saw it with the hair up to its furthest point.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that a continual flow of tears does not result from the incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with only a hook, or with a thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, of which this is the form.
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the horny coat, and that a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Then after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a concoction made from ziniar, and leave it until another day.
Then care for it with what is necessary, until it is healed. If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fastened to it, then this type of nail is frequently treated with medicines, and healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a thin, gentle, blunt spatula, of this form.
And shave the nail from above with care.
If you see that it is becoming thin and breaking, and the shaving imprints on it, then drop from your hour-glass into the eye a sieve made from ziniar, or a red sieve, or crushed salt: and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation upon it, until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye, in which case leave it alone, and treat the abscess until it is healed. Then repeat the operation on it with the knife, until it is healed.
If, however, a fleshy prominence of the tear duct causes great harm to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it cut away; and do not complete the incision so that the flow of tears is not impeded.
Then instill into the tear duct a red salve, or one made from ziniari, until healed. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes red flesh grows in the eyes of some people, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or clings to the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a rose's bud.
And the treatment for it is also that the sick person should lay his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and collect that entire flesh with suitable hooks for that: and hold it with one forceps, or tweezers.
Then cut the flesh first, until its whole is finished with a scalpel.
And be careful of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a spatula, as we have described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asbel is collected, according to its form which will follow this chapter.
When, therefore, your incision is completed, and the whole alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it a red powder, and similar corrosives from medicines; and place over the outside of the eye a cloth with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with added flesh which occurs in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid treating every weak eye by a natural or accidental route, operating with iron; and do not insert your hand in any of these operations until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and impede the eye's function of sight; and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which the sebel is present is strong, and there is no other ailment in it besides the sebel; then collect the sebel from it.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place their head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a slender double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on a single body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors with precision, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are dissolved; and beware that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the scissors.
And let your operation be in the midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye a green or red juice, so that its sharpness will corrode whatever remains of the scab.
However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for several days, until its pain subsides, and it is secure from a hot abscess; then again upon it according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the Arissati fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning sharp medicine, according to its preceding description.
And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in it, unless you cut open the abscess near its origin and extract all the moisture and pus from it until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape.
And it is called an Asperi head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which is pointed with the filing of a file, or with a fine-pointed aliskilferi, and place it on the corrupted part of the bone. Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand for a short time, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand for a short time, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times. Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no accident occurs in it, then you know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you detect the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is detected, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular, and its wood be a tapering pyramid to the tip, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand slightly away from the eye.
Then revolve your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it; through this, that they find air escaping from it, when they hold their hand over their nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter that was flowing outward returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter on the sick person.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs to the vision, then you should release the patient, then bleed him, and afterward place cupping vessels on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Then bandage the eye from above over the plaster with many small bandages.
And the method of the bandages is: that you should take many soft cloths, and each cloth should be doubled over four times; make many of them; then place them one over the other, according to the amount needed for the eye; then bind them over with a hard cloth using a strong bandage.
And again apply cupping vessels with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping vessels, and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the tunic of the uvea, this is good; and if not, then apply again the plaster, and bandages, and binding, and cupping vessels, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and disfigures the appearance of the person because of it, and one wishes to cut it: then the procedure for it is, as I describe: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then introduce another needle on which is a double thread from the lacrimal side, and let it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle; and tighten it greatly.
Then remove the needle, and place on the eye wool steeped in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread with the uvea falls.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a bandage, until the eye adds great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white moisture runs, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This disease, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.
And the method of operating on it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or stand upright.
Then take its head with your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to your eyes.
Then let it be fixed, and not descend, and the light be released: and let the sick person see things as he saw them before: and if it did not descend further, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a sharp spatula, and with it split the cornea slightly near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, at the edge, until pus comes out.
When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the types of water in division, and what is appropriate for piercing is declared and explained in speech; then take that same thing according to health.
Then it is necessary to make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tightly bind it; then the eyelid of the eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the extremity of the almagda near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the lesser tear-duct in the white of the eye; then propel the almagda with force; and you turn your hand with it until it penetrates the white of the eye; and feel that the almagda has now reached the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almagda up to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his vision immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almagda exits.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almagda with ease, and you turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve some of clear gem-salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Then place over the eye all the lint or wool soaked in rose oil and the white of an egg, and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place on it crushed cumin with the white of an egg.
If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men, whose eye is very hard, then you must take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Therefore, scrape with it only the conjunctiva, and do not place your hand in the hole; and there is nothing other than to make a way for the almagda to its place subtly.
Then introduce the almagda, according to what we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a properly made bedroom, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and forbid him all movements, and coughing; and place his food that which soothes his nature; and do not let him move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day. Then remove it in that dark house, and test his vision; and make him see things.
Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And it should not be done at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary to remove it; because water ascends quickly through violent looking.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed. Then, restore its vision, and place over its face an oral thing by which its vision is governed for a few days, him being in that dark house.
Then let him leave the house gradually and walk around in his own houses.
And know that in a zaltea, a student is not excused from the vision some times; for then let him dare on the operation.
And now indeed there has come to us one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a perforated magdan was made, by which water is drawn.
But indeed I have seen no one in your land who has done that, nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Let them be made of air properly, and let their extremities be triangular with the same subtlety, and pointed.
Forms of the magdan.
Concerning the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter XXIV.
Sometimes various fleshy growths arise in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many legs, and among them is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark color; and there is also flesh that is soft, not dark-colored.
In those fleshy growths that are soft, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, you should have the infirm person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into the flesh; then pull it outward, and cut what you have grasped from it with a sharp, slender spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
If anything remained from that which cannot be removed: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
If, however, blood dominates it, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Then after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose.
If, however, the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary to introduce a linen thread of some thickness, and make many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less; and let the sick man cause one end of the thread to enter the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him, after he has made it similar to an azire; and let him pull his odor, until it reaches the cause, and emerges above his throat.
And often indeed children do something similar to this in schools; and it is an easy matter for him who wants to.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges from the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Then remove the flesh shavings with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread, and after cleaning the blood, place in the nose a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then place a lead cannula at the end of the object in the nose for several days, until it is healed.
If however it needs a treatment that will dry it, use that.
To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are instilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be like a small lamp, open like a seashell, and its passageway similarly.
And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a tube.
And let the seashell instrument for making a nasal douche be full, uncovered; let it have a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and flowing substances.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart arises at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and larger with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cauterize it and remove the whole of it.
Then place upon the spot either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of dark color, and with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For I have often seen that he who incises a man's abscess, and great harm comes from it to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the infirmity, and incise it without fear; and treat the place with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit results from surgery, except in some individuals.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then join the wound edges with suture, and thereafter treat it until it is healed.
And if the separated edges of the break in continuity are already sound, then it is necessary to scrape away all parts from their apparent skin until they bleed.
Then join the two edges with sutures, and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and powdered frankincense on it; and place over the powder a piece of diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads are cut away by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is to bring together the break in continuity either with needles, as we have described in abdominal suturing, or to bring it together with thread, as I have caused you to know.
Concerning the extraction of lip nodules.
Chapter XXVII. Many people frequently have hard abscesses like plant seeds inside their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary to turn the lip over, and to incise over each nodule on it, and to suspend it with a hook, and to cut it from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with pounded zegi, until the blood is stopped.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of flesh grown upon the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Often flesh grows upon the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Then place upon the place pounded zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with an iron tool.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes blackened, yellowish, and greenish crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, both inner and outer, and between the gums, until the corruption from it reaches the gums, and the teeth become unsightly due to it.
Therefore, you should place the weak person between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and scrape the molar and tooth where you see the crusts, and a substance resembling sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things until they are cleansed.
If, therefore, that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally your effort reaches what you desire.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes, many forms, according to how it is prepared for your operation; for the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And these forms of scrapers be prepared by you, which you see.
Of the extraction of toothache.
Chapter 30.
You must treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in its eradication.
For there is nothing that will replace its function when it is extracted, because it is a superior substance; until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to extract it, so that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be certified by you.
For often the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks it is in the tooth itself and extracts it; afterwards the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there should be some virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held well so that it does not move; then pull the tooth in a straight line, so as not to break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth; and bind it with the end of a thin reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you carefully make the scarification around the gum on every side very much.
And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person with that greater malice which is greater pain to him at first.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness in its eradication, beyond what we have described.
For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are harder to break, and its roots all remain, or some of them; or to extract it with some of the jawbones, as we have testified many times. Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then rub some of the zegi, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the delicate forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth; they should be like those with thick handles, so that when you grip them, they do not yield or double; with short extremities, and made of tempered iron, or well-made steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities should be teeth, some of which fit into others, and grip with a proper, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, during the removal of a tooth that breaks, something remains, then it is necessary to apply ointment with butter to the place for one or two days, until the place softens; then introduce a drill or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
However, this is the shape of the forceps.
Let their extremities be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully work upon the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short in extremity, somewhat thick, and not be soaked so that it does not break.
If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to help with other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular in extremity, in which there is some thickness.
The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
Also, help is given with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with other instruments and tools that have preceded in the description of the teeth.
Also, there is assistance with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, of this form: triangular extremity twisted, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break, and may not be absorbed.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many, and similarly the other instruments are not counted, and the skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to which the operation and the ailments themselves indicate to him.
Because there are ailments for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies, then examine it in its place with what is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps that I have described in the extraction of roots, and assist with a forceps, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be grasped, or held with it, and may not escape and go away until the bone comes out; and restore the place with remedies appropriate to it.
If, however, there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
Of the sawing of teeth that project above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, a foul form is produced by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
For if a tooth is born behind another tooth, and is not positioned correctly, or its sawing or filing is not possible, then remove it; and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, which has this shape.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If, however, it is prominent, exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of tempered iron, whose shape is this.
Let the whole thing be of tempered iron, and its handle of small points very fine, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls; then smooth it, and finally scrape it with some scrapers.
If, however, it is a tooth from which a piece has broken off, and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even; and flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on it without it falling out; and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment has been unsuccessful; then it is expedient that they be bound with gold wire; because silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of a medium thinness and thickness according to the amount that it will hold between the teeth.
And the method of retention is this: take a wire, and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving to the point from which you began; and tighten your hand with care and wisdom until it is firmly fixed; and let your tightening of the wire be close to the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both together, and turn them over with forceps; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be so tight that it remains.
If however it comes loose or is cut, tighten them with another wire, and it will remain fixed in that way throughout the whole time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the way of retention of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after falling out, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and no one but a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman can accomplish this.
And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the gap, from which the tooth is reinforced and tightened, as we said: and it remains and serves with it for a long time.
Of the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
If in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and if it is from the consolidation of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it along its breadth, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
If a flow of blood occurs, then place crushed zegi over the area. If, however, the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentiginous cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which forms under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess forms under the tongue, resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
If, therefore, you see it to be dark, or black, hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is tending towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all sides.
If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place crushed zegi upon it until the bleeding stops; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt, and care for it with the appropriate remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it, or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in colour, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the procedure in it is that you should consider before its operation if its abscess has settled down completely in quiet warmth, or is reduced by some lessening.  Then, therefore, make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and let his head be in your bosom.  And open his mouth, and let an attendant take it between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this. Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is thin like a knife.
When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outward as far as you can, except for what you pull out with it from the tissues.
Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is this that follows.
It resembles shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a straight line with the other sharply: hence, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or of soaked alfuled.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Then after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranates' peels have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from astringents, until the flow of blood is cut off: then care for him, until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore, cut those according to what I have said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, with little sensation, which had almost entirely closed her throat: and the woman was breathing with a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her to eat and drink water: and she had already arrived at death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Therefore, I hastened, and fixed a hook into one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which proceeded from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed from it; therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took food.
Therefore, I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time; and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I cut, until it was prolonged too much along with it.
Therefore, I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore, it stood still from further additions; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has rested from it, and it is subtle; then it is necessary to cut it.
And that which is gathered from it, round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brownish or black color, and has no sensation; then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For there is fear over the weak one.
Therefore, when you see it according to the way I described from its whiteness and length, you should make the sick person sit in front of the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the description came before; then fix a hook in the uvula and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not cut from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut from it more, you harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use what we described in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the sick person is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear or panic.
And the method of the cautery on it is not, except with sharp water, and is, that you place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Then take from the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it not thick, nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, which has this shape.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of the bowl of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself: and let the sick person lie on their side, so that saliva runs from their mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it into their throat and harms them.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you shall keep it upon the uvula for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already blackened, and the biting of the medicine has settled.
And if you wish to take the spittle, and wrap it around the extremity of the spoon, and pour the spittle with the medicine, and introduce the spoon with the spittle into the cannula from above, until the spittle adheres to the uvula. Do it many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe the area around the uvula with a cloth soaked in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine, and rinse with cold water.
And treat it externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further from danger than incision.
And sometimes the uvula is treated with something finer than a cautery or incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be well plastered with mud: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed according to this method.
Let it be made of silver or bronze, and let the end, on which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula above the tube, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
For it usually increases the abscess, and you ought not to do it except at the decline of its heat.
If, however, this instrument is not present for you, then take a tube and place a layer of egg white at its end, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned, because the egg white prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from a good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them, upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument at the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the stomach weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
Perhaps the attached thing will exit through vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and it is extracted, then it exits. If therefore it does not exit with that which we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a Radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which let him introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that coughing does not befall him, and let him push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that which the infirm introduce, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it emerges.
Concerning the extraction of the leech.
Chapter XXXIX.
When a leech is medicated with what I have said in the division of treatment with medicines, and does not work, then consider in the throat of the infirm in the sun, or by the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have told you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps skillfully.
If it is not possible with those, then take a concave cannula, and introduce it into the throat of the infirm, up to near the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Do that many times; and let the infirm abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
However, if it does not emerge with what we have described, then fumigate the infirm person with leeches, or with asa with the instrument that I described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live pruners with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole; and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and let the infirm person place his mouth on the extremity of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not emerge, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the infirm person endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat, when it falls upon itself as seen.
It is similar to forceps, as you see; except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the throat.
And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Chapter XL.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of various types, according to the way in which they are recalled, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways.
One of which is from the species of abscess within itself, and that which it comprises from humors.
And the second mode is on account of the places in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy part is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And among abscesses are those that should not be opened, unless after the maturation of the pus within them and its completion; and among them are those which must be opened while they are raw and do not mature according to completion.
Such as abscesses that are close to the joints.
Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its existence until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is a cause more proximate to the contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near a main limb: because if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the main limb through it.
Or it is near the anus, therefore open it unripe; and it is not necessary to open a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become incurable at its end. It is necessary that you know the time for the incision of a mature abscess according to its completion: and it is by the abatement of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of the abscess head; and the other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower part of the abscess, and of greater prominence: and let the incision be along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the incision along that limb.
When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave its incision until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its completion.
Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it will be prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
And some abscesses are incised across the width of the body, according to necessity; or along the one which the limb requires.
And it is necessary, that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses; or many incisions by the likeness of the abscess's magnitude.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin; and to incise when it has already become like a cloth, and has reached a point where it is already dead; as that which happens in many, such as boils, and buboes.
And some of them are incised with an incision having three angles.
And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like a groin abscess.
And among them are those in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions are administered.
That which does not have a head, however, such as mild superficial abscesses, ought to be pierced with a superficial, or merely a flat, perforation.
And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a portion of it.
Then close the abscess until another day.
Then extract something more of the pus again.
Do this many times according to a gradual process, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly frail person: for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the animal with the exit of the pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply strips of linen or old cloth.
And if the abscess is large, and the perforations are numerous, it is then necessary that you insert a strip into each fissure, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have excised a portion of skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or shaved with flax lint without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate, until it heals.
If however, bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a cloth in them, and place it repeatedly over the bleeding area.
If, however, the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in detail.
If, however, it is during wintertime, and the location of the abscess is full of nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse small pillows with warm wine and oil, and place them on the affected areas.
And if it be in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place small pillows soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make the whole thing cold.
Until, when the third day shall arrive, as we have said, then it is necessary to open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its treatment what is appropriate, until it is healed.
This, then, is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Following the path of distinction, however, I have already discussed every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment in a chapter by chapter, individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the type of Nodes, which are contained by membranes, which are like sacks around them; as if they were a hen's poultices.
And their types are numerous.
Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like fritters and gruels; and similar to these; and some are hard, stony.
And there is no fear in the incision and extraction of all of them, provided that the incision does not encounter a contrary artery.
And the procedure for their incision is to test them with an instrument, whose shape comes after this, called the Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, in this manner.
And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst containing the moisture, and leave nothing of it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains of it. Then immerse the wound in Egyptian unguent, if present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
For it will corrode what remains of the cyst. Then apply the unguent a second, a third, and as many times as necessary until you are sure no part of the cyst remains.  Then treat the wound with the unguent until healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this shape, the incision having the form of a cross; and place hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and exert your strength in removing the membrane that contains it.
If however an artery resists you, then do that which I will tell you afterward.
And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, as we have said. And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are in the head in some men, in which there is no moisture at all.
Or make their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus is alleviated downwards.
Then treat them with what is appropriate for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of goiters on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those that arise from them on the neck, there are single ones and many; and they generate from each other; and every goiter from them is within its own tunic, as is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the varieties of these goiters are numerous.
And some of them are stony; and some contain moisture; and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in any such one that you see, by touch, of good disposition, whose proximity to the skin color is evident, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, nor is deep: you should excise it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b to line, g, and scrape it from every side; and stretch the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said regarding abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is a precaution not to cut a vein or a nerve.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put pounded zegi into the wound, or some powders which stop bleeding, and compress the wound and leave it, until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or begins to putrefy.
For the bleeding is stopped then, therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Then treat it.
If the entire scab is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound, and to suture it immediately, after you see that there is no longer any excess.
However, if you see that excess remains due to the size of the scab, then it is necessary to attempt to cut its root and remove it, and apply the suture we have described.
And whatever humours the scabs contain, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that you may see its site of maturity; and place the puncture from that which is next beneath the body, as we said.
Then, after the puncture, apply liniments with ointments, and similar things to them, so as to corrode whatever remains of corruption, until when you see that the wound is now cleansed; then treat it with a generative flesh ointment, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said that this incision into the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the writing of their discourse.
However, in those suffering from angina, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; since no benefit results from it; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the channel, one should use the incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the danger that comes from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis below three or four rings of the epiglottis, with a small incision across the width, in that which is between two rings, to an extent that the incision is in the synovia, not in the cartilage; and this place is indeed suitable for the incision, since it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should split the skin, until when he reaches the channel; he should avoid any blood vessel if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the synovia, as we have described: and it is indicated, on the incision of the channel, by the phlegm that flows from it, with what is broken and with the severance of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the time in which suffocation is feared passes, bring together the two lips of the wound's skin, and sew it together alone, without cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The summary of this discourse we have recounted is not applicable except when they see that some of these abscesses have already filled the patient's throat; and the patient is raised above death, and his breath wants to be cut off; they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death; and for this reason they ordered the wound to be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, or something like that; then, therefore, they ordered the wound to be sewn up and cared for until it is healed.
And that which I saw myself is that a maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and with it cut a portion of the lung's passage.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groaning of the dead.
Therefore I probed the wound, and found blood which had flowed out of the small wound.
Therefore I concluded that she had not severed a vein, nor an artery; and wind was issuing from the wound.
Therefore I hastened and treated the wound, until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better condition.
Therefore I say: that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Concerning the section of a hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental. Certainly, in the natural one, there is no ingenuity.
The accidental one, however, is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
And the other way is similar to an abscess formed from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it should not be presumed to be attacked with iron, unless it is small; and you should probe it and investigate it with an instrument.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it as tumors are cut: and extract it with that which contains it from a cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then investigate its entire extent.
Then treat the place with what is necessary from the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision on the species of Tumors.
Chapter XLV. There are many types of tumors, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary to describe here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it causes doubt. Therefore, I say that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and severe pain, until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a tumor, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains sacs (or pockets) called sifachin, which are a distinct pouch, and are according to the color of the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha (or a particular type of bean), larger or smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
And the colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division. Therefore, when you arrive at treating a tumor, it is necessary to examine it, and first inquire into its form with an instrument called an Intromissum, as its form will be shown in the chapter after this one.
And the method of investigating all abscesses and tumors is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest spot you find within the abscess; and you should slowly rotate your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand over the abscess according to its size.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which issues forth in its wake.
If, therefore, a flowing moisture, of whatever color, issues forth: then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said concerning other abscesses.
And if no moisture issues forth in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty; therefore, cut above it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from every side easily; and keep the cyst, if you can, above it, so that you extract the sound one with the tumor.
However, if the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if anything small or large remains of it, the tumor returns mostly.
If, however, it overcomes you, and a little remains of it, then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and place upon it that which sits the warm abscess, and treat it with the remaining cure until it heals.
If therefore the tumor is large, then suture its two lips, and treat it with that which causes healing. If, however, there is a pulsating vein or one that is not pulsating, then hurry and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood ceases. Then return to cutting that which remains of the tumor.
Concerning the instruments for incision and perforation.
Chapter XLVI.
Among them are the forms of instruments, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of iron, with squared ends, fitting well, so that they may quickly enter the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called a beris, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for probing abscesses, and openings, and fistulas, and buboes, from that which is between the bones.
And others are made round, sharp, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citrine, or of bronze, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those made of citrine.
And also made of black lead, which are suitable for probing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their smoothness with those reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Because some of them are long, some of them medium, and some of them short, according to the quantity of the fistula's breadth and its stricture. The shape of Hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because some of them are simple, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And from among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And from among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped away: and they are of three kinds: because from among them is a large, medium, and small one.
Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are blunt: and they are not positioned thus, unless that with them help is given in scraping knots in fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick person might be healed by them, and find a little peace from the burning which he finds when scraping an abscess.
These are large ones, and they are of three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a rod, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end a hidden spatula point is located: and in it runs inward and outward when one wishes, as you see.
The shape of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat elongated, as you see: and let them be of fine quality.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you: so that you may cut off blood with speed in case of need, and then when there is no medicine present.
However, do not use them for cutting off blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy parts: such as the thighs of the legs, and the hips, and the forearms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groins, and similar to them, from fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments are made from them, similar to hazelnuts, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made from them, round, according to this form.
Concerning the care of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflated at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to become defiled in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts; and they remain foul-looking, suppurating.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, it is necessary that he cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a healing medicine.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed.
If, however, the breast inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to make an incision on its two upper sides, with two incisions similar in shape to a crescent, each of which is contained within the other at the extremities of each, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
If, however, you do not complete the incision that you should make, because of the patient's distress or because of blood flow, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses which occur under the armpit, are of the types of hard Strophulae, containing cysts, and some contain moistnesses.
Therefore, those of them that contain moistnesses must be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, according to this shape, from line b. to line g. When, therefore, everything that is in the abscess from the pus is evacuated, then fill it with old cotton, and leave it until another day.
Then the cotton should be removed, and treated with a suitable ointment for it, until healed.
If the abscess is of the type of knotted Strophulae, then cut upon it, as we said in the section on Strophulae, equally.
If, however, the wound extends in this, so as to emit pus, then administer a cautery to it, according to what we said in what was previously stated.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and a vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery bursts and the skin above it consolidates, then very often an abscess results from this; and similarly, a vein, too, may have an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and a vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the outward part of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, should also be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is from them, from the swelling of the artery's opening, make a cut in the skin lengthwise.
Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and free it from its tunics, until it is uncovered.
Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
If it be an abscess because of the incision of a vein, then you must hold with your hand what you are able of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let a double thread be in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the grapevine ligature, with two ends of the thread on two sides. If, however, you fear that the thread will be drawn out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside it emerges; then cut the excess skin, and let what is tied from it go.
Then place on it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment with bandages and ointments until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: which occurs in them by blows, or by excessive exertion, and the like; and it occurs most often in the places of the tendons, or the heel, and in every place where joints move; and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many cases without pain; and when it is pressed with force, the sick person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
And it is not a deep-seated, collected abscess, but rather beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forwards, or before, nor backwards, to the rear.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron.
For perhaps contraction will result.
However, in that which is in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a scalpel.
If, therefore, it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it away from its root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it: then remove it, and close the wound with sutures: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Chapter LI. Some people frequently have growths in their bellies, and in other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inward.
And some of them are small, and some of them become very large.
And indeed I have seen a man, and in his belly were two growths that were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, with slender roots, and their lips turned inward, and they split open, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore I cut them, and found one to weigh approximately ten and eight ounces, and the other approximately six ounces.  And the operation in cutting them is that, if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with slender roots, then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries in the fire present.
For often much blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient fearful and timid from the incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead, properly fashioned, and bind the ulcer with it: using the method we described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead bandage.
Therefore do not cease to bind the lead, whenever it presses on the ulcer, until it is severed and falls away by itself without effort.
If however the ulcer is large in its root, then in its incision there is some fear and terror: especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut it in half.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to cut an ulcer that is dark-colored, with little feeling, and of foul appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
Of the treatment of the navel eminence.
Chapter LII.
The navel eminence arises from many causes.
Or from fissures in the skin above the abdomen; and from it protrudes air, or an intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood flowing from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said before.
Or from constriction of air within it.
If however it is because of a fissure in the skin, and an exit of pus, then it is the colour of an abscess similar to the colour of the body; and it is smooth, without pain; and it appears in various locations.
And if it is because of the emergence of an intestine, then its location, with the variety we have described, is more severe.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it enlarges greatly at the entrance of the bath, and with strenuous exertion.
If however it is because of moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrict, nor does it increase.
If however it is because of blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black to the eye.
If however it is due to generated flesh: then it is a severe, large, hard abscess, and fixed according to a single quantity.
If however it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth. And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or wind: then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it.
For in it there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine, or wind: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to hold his breath and stand extended.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Afterwards, order him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel over the place you marked with ink.
Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Then bind it around firmly with thread, or with a silk cord or firm ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be tied.
Then open the middle of the abscess stretched above the ligature.
If therefore you find it already caught by the ligature, then remove the ligature, and introduce your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
If however the artery or vein is opposite you, then surround it greatly.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles around the circumference you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you cause to penetrate.
Then tie the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the stretched flesh putrefies and falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefied.
Then treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate until it is healed.
If the swelling of the navel is from flesh growing in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we said.
And extract the blood or moisture which you find in it.
Then treat it with whatever consolidates the place.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER. Chapter LIII.
For I myself could not heal anyone from it; nor did I see anyone before me who attained it.
And the operation for it, when it is located as we said, is to proceed and to relieve the sick person from black cholera sometimes.
Then phlebotomize it if you find it with manifest fullness.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation, in which he/she will be placed with the operation.
Then apply hooks that fit to the Cancer.
Then hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and allow the blood to run, and do not cut it quickly, rather squeeze the places and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
If, however, the flow of thick blood from the incision of the artery, or vein, is causing you difficulty, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter LIIII.
We have already narrated in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the species of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the species of tympanites: nor in the species of hyposarca completely: for that is deadly.
When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then consider.
For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or loosening of the belly, and things similar to them, then beware of treating him with iron, because there is fear of that.
If however you see the sick person of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is not a child, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and a servant behind him presses his belly with his hand, propelling the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a thorny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with sharp extremities like a spatula.
However, let there be something of shortness gradually in it, so that you do not proceed with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and harm him.
Then consider.
For if there is a generation of dropsy from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you proceed with the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
If however the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then perforate with an instrument the entire skin.
Then insert into that incision, and elevate your hand with the Spatula between the skin, and do so, as if you were to scrape it; and let the quantity scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Then perforate, doing so until the spatula reaches the empty place, and it is the place of water.
Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument of this form.
And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; on whose lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the tip of it is cut, according to the incision of a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour by the resolution of his animal spirit, or a syncope occurs to him that approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person signify to you by the virtue of his pulse, and by his condition.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the opening that is over the sifac: of which I spoke, that you should pierce it according to that method.
Then again apply the instrument on the second day, if you see the sick person tolerate it: and extract also a small quantity from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until there remains only a little water.
However, if you fear for the sick person and you remove much water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and the sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize the stomach, and the liver, and the spleen, after the removal of water, according to what I have previously stated.
Concerning the treatment of infants born in places where their urinary passages are not perforated.
Chapter LV. When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its scrotum is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to help by perforating it immediately when it is born, with a very fine spatula, in this way.
Then place a small leaden pin in the opening and bind it; and hold it for three or four days.
When, therefore, it wants to urinate, let it be removed, and let it urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which enters over the place will not allow it to close.
However, he whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
However, those in whom the opening is in an improper place are injured.
That is because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: wherefore it cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis upwards with his hand. Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb properly: and it is a very foul illness.
And the method of operation in him is that the sick person is laid on his back.
Then extend his penis with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the penis from the glans, with a sharp scalpel, or a sharp spatumil, just as one cuts a reed, or as you scrape something off, so that its middle comes forth like the head of the penis; and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And beware of the flow of blood in your operation.
For it often happens.
Therefore, apply to it what cuts off the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning matters that occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and concerning corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These Albather frequently occur in the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it some are malignant, and others not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut off until you have cleansed the whole of it.
Then place a poultice soaked in Egyptian unguent on it. Then treat it afterwards with the unguent dyafinicon, until it is healed.
If it is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If, however, the Albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and a part of the Albather is within the foreskin, and a part of it outside, then it is necessary to remove the Albather, which is inside first, until when it is consolidated, then treat the outer part: because when you treat both simultaneously, the foreskin is not protected from being pierced.
And such things also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin, with blackness and corruption.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that is already blackened, and that which is about to corrupt, or is already corrupt.
Then apply a line over it with honey, which has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark, and ground, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions simultaneously, namely, for a flow of blood, and for a wound when it corrupts.
If the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the patient may urinate over it.
However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required upon it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish these things accurately, then it is necessary to scrape a bit from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may perhaps be perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with astringent wine, until it hardens. Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is by our operation, our will, and its use is specifically in boys, it is necessary that we delineate a better operation and a more gentle path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not say anything about circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
Because I have found most artisans and phlebotomists using cleansing, by cutting with a razor and with scissors, and they use cauterization and tying with thread, and incision with a fingernail.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors, and ligation with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; thus, it is forced to an incision to cut the other, and the resulting pain.
And with cleansing done with cauterization, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In cleansing with a lancet, perhaps the iron slips away, and spoils your operation: and the skin of the boy is of short nature, and many times they are born thus, that they do not need cleansing: and I have seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors, and ligation with thread, has revealed a good experiment to me: because scissors are proportional to the incision: because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and cut according to one operation at one time: and a compression of similar shape is made, encompassing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error falls at all.
And the manner of the proper operation is, that you cause the boy, especially if he is of those who understand a little, to consider that you do not do anything but tie a thread to his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible to you, from what his understanding receives.
Then introduce your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it of the dirt that collects on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards, tie a second ligature slightly below that. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the area of the lower ligature with a firm grip, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin quickly upwards and extract the head of the rod.
Then let the blood run slowly (for this is better), and place powder on top; and on top of the powder, a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt and meet; so that a nail's branch does not emerge from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be the same as the length of the two handles taken together.
An error, however, occurring in the cleansing is: that perhaps the inner skin escapes entirely, or part of it, near the incision. Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it out from your hour with your fingernail before the abscess of the place; and cut it along its equal parts.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook, and cut it.
However, if three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it, until the abscess is mature, and open it with ease, and cut it as prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod.
For it will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have recounted in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper regions, it will not harm it even then.
Therefore, treat it with that which we said, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growing flesh, and similar things to those that we have mentioned from the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over on his knees.
Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man strain his breath as much as possible.
This causes the stone in the neck of the bladder to be expelled backwards, therefore the urine is released.
If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the sick person, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, called a syringe, whose form is this: it should be of silver, and be thin, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird's feather in thinness, and the length of one and a half palms; to which there should be a thin tube at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you should take a doubled thread, and tie wool, or tow, a good ligature, to its extremity; and insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any wool is superfluous, but insert into the tube with force, like a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and have the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double it upwards from the navel. Then push the syringe within it, until it reaches the bladder, and the sick person feels it has reached the empty space; and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage in which it goes is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and make the urine run through the urinary way; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow space, in which that which propels it is situated, should be according to the quantity that will fill it without addition, until when something is drawn along with it, the humidities are drawn out; and when it is propelled, it expels along with it something to a distance: in accordance with what the clepsydra does, by which naphta, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Therefore, when you wish to project humidities into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the humidity, and draw up with that which propels it to the upper part, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then introduce its extremity into the tube, according to what we have narrated about the syringe.
Then propel the humidity with that which propels it, for that humidity reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it. A subtle form of clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then assemble the circle, as a saucer is assembled; after you have placed in it what you wish of the humors, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument; and do with it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
Chapter LX. We have already discussed the division of the types of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have explained the difference between stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs thereof: and I have described the stone in which manual operation and incision are appropriate; and this is the stone generated in the bladder properly; and that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am explaining it with clear exposition and abbreviation.
I say therefore, that stone generated in the bladder happens most often in children.
And among its signs is that the urine issues from the bladder like water in its subtlety; and white sand appears in it, and the weak man rubs his urethra, and labors with it, and often hangs (from pain). Then it rises, and the anus issues with it in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, so long as they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
However, in young people it is intermediate, in that which is between those two: and the cure is easier for one whose stone is larger; and if small, the cure is conversely difficult.
Therefore, when we come to treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will expel all the waste matter that is in their intestines: for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during examination. Then let the sick person be taken up by their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the depths of the bladder, or leaps from a high place sometimes.
Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hasten immediately with incision upon it.
If, however, it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to wipe your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if he is a full youth; and insert it into his anus, and inquire about the stone, until it stands under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you wish; and order the minister to press the bladder with his hand, and order another minister to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand to remove the skin, which is under the testicles, in the part from the place where the incision is.
Then insert the spatula, whose shape is this.
And find in it that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, on the side of the left buttock; and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to exit from it no larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, presses the stone at the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that from the stone are angles and edges, wherefore its exit becomes difficult because of that.
And from it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
To that, therefore, which has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary that you devise something above it: or that you bind over it with a suitable instrument, whose tip is like the Moon, which binds over the stone and does not slip from it: or that you introduce under it a slender instrument with a curved tip.
If however you cannot above it, then enlarge the opening a little.
If anything from the blood overcomes you, cut it with a zegi.
If however the stone is more than one, then propel the largest first to the opening of the bladder.
Then cut above it.
Afterwards, propel the small one after that; and do likewise if there are more than two.
If however it is very large, then ignorance it is to cut above it with a large incision.
For if one of two things happens to the sick person, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him, because the place is not wholly consolidated.
But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or devise means to fracture it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or rose-oil, and cold water, so that a hot abscess might subside.
Then lay the sick person on his back, upon his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you have therefore loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with the ointment dyafinicon and the ointment basilicon, until it is healed.
If however a hot abscess, and corrosive matter, and similar things, happen added to the wound: just as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from issuing from it: and that is known from the outflow of blood with the urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply any sort of treatment with what is suitable for healing, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the whole period of treatment, that you bind the two hips, and the buttocks, for the sake of the medicaments that are placed on the area.
If there is a small stone, and it is in the urethra, and is fixed in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I have narrated before you reach the stage of cutting.
For very often you will be spared from cutting by this treatment, for I have already tested it. And it is necessary that you take a trocar of iron, whose shape is this: triangular at the end, pointed, fixed in wood.
Then take thread and tie the urethra below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the urethra easily, until the trocar reaches the stone itself: and rotate the trocar with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer side of the urethra.
For it [the stone] breaks and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is cured.
If however this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread beneath the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone on the urethra itself, between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood which forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread beneath the stone is not necessary, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you to raise the skin upwards when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Chapter LXI.
Little stone is generated in women.
If, however, a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden because of many reasons.
One of them is: that a woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
If, however, you trust her, then seek a chaste, skilled physician, and present a female midwife well versed in women's matters, or a woman who in this art hints at part of the art: therefore, make her present, and especially to her, let her do everything you command her regarding the investigation of the stone. First of all, that she look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should grasp it with her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak woman's vagina, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she move it gradually from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she brings it to the root of the thigh.
Then she shall cut upon it at the point opposite the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever part it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger shall not be removed from the stone, grasping it beneath: and let the incision be small at first.
Then she shall insert a rod upon that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then she shall add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the species of stones are many. For among these there is the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round with branches.
Therefore, know its species, so that this may be signified to you concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add to the place ground zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it with ligatures in a fitting constriction: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
Concerning the incision of an aqueous hernia.
Chapter LXII.
An aqueous hydrocele is not present unless there is an aggregation of moisture in a white substance, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the testicle: and it is called sifac. And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it becomes putrid: which is another testicle, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we have mentioned: and that does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of this hydrocele indeed is from the weakness that happens to the testicles; wherefore this material is poured onto them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours. For either its colour is inclining to yellowness, or it is bloody red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
For if it is in the white sifac which we have said, then the abscess is round to a little length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in the pannicle proper to itself, then the abscess is round like part of an egg, and therefore a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
Therefore, when you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose shape preceded.
Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromiss, judge of that which is between it.
When, therefore, we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person to be bled if possible to him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back upon a slightly raised object, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right side, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the scrotum skin, and to the part of the abdominal wall.
Then take a broad spatula and cut the scrotal skin from the middle lengthwise, until near the pubic bone: and let the incision be according to the straight equidistant line that divides the scrotal skin, until it reaches the white membrane containing it: and scrape it and observe, or beware of this, that you dissect it: and let your scraping, with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs with the egg more: and subtly examine with your scraping as much as possible to you.
Then pierce the water-filled membrane with a wide perforation, and extract all the water. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the membrane upwards, and do not touch the scrotal skin encompassing it: and cut the membrane however it is possible for you to cut it, either in its entirety or in pieces, especially its delicate side.
For if you do not meticulously examine it, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
However, if the egg protrudes outward from its skin during your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the membrane, return it.
Then join the two lips of the scrotal skin with suture.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals.
If, however, you find a black, corrupted egg, then you must tie the vessels that are the suspensory ligaments, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterward treat it with what we have said.
If indeed water has collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part in the same way you did the other, equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it; afterward wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the lower abdomen; and place over it doubled cloths, and they are pillows; and tie them on top with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the extremities with which it is pressed be made of cotton, or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a tightening band at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one extremity take hold above the anus up to the back, and the second take hold to the side of the pubic area; and two extremities over the two thighs below, and two other extremities over the two groins, and let the entire tightening band be gathered at the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the incision site with an iron. And it is that you should take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it should be heated, as we have described; until when a white, water-containing substance is exposed, then take the cautery according to this form.
It is similar to a Greek letter.
Then pierce it with it, and it should be heated until all the moisture comes out.
Then spread the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you remove all of it.
And be careful, from the egg, that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with section.
If, however, something adverse happens to you during the time of the section, or a hot abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else, during the cautery: then you ought to treat whatever adversity befalls you from it with the treatment that is appropriate for it, as was previously stated.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its horror, then administer the perforation as I describe it: and so it is.
When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice over the area, and bind it, and allow it to run off the remaining water; then treat it until the wound heals.
If, however, there is resistance to the egress of water at the time you pierce it, and this is only because a white cloth causes resistance at the wound's opening and prevents the exit of water, then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, whose shape has preceded, or add a little to the wound's operation.
And know that water returns and gathers after six months, or approximately that time.
When it gathers, then it should be pierced in the same manner, and the patient will pass their days.
On the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the incision upon this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many cases.
Therefore, it seems to me that its removal is a saving from it.
And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely. Or from an acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out onto the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it is formed from the knotting of arteries and their inflation; just as its remembrance has already preceded; or from the inflation of veins.
Therefore, that which is from them by the inflation of the arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it entirely.
However, that which is formed from the inflation of veins does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers. And it is now possible that a section be made upon this kind, and upon the remaining flesh; and it is as if the skin of the testicles is separated.
Then extend the egg upward, and pull it out with the white sifach; and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part from the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to pull the egg and cut it. And if there is adhesion between something from the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and pull out the egg, as we said. When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool steeped in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
On the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Chapter LXIV.
Vitis is an abscess enveloped by some wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles; and difficult movement and exercise, and walking, result in the sufferer.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of that which preceded it, recalling.
But it is necessary, as we say, that the operation be performed on it according to what the first ones did. Therefore I say that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape away from all sides, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle, straight, along the length of the body, and extract that which is aggregated from the putrid, foul humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
For there is no evil through it.
However, if all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the vessels because the egg will not receive nourishment due to the incision, and will wither or dry up, and will be of no benefit with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal colic. Chapter LXV.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
And this rupture is either from the sifach, or its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a cry, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal in depth, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is from a section of the sifach, because it causes a sudden, violent pain from the outset: and the abscess is different, appearing beneath the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum; and this is called a Ramex intestinalis, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there; and this is harmful to the sick person, because it causes a dull pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these kinds of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, one must beware of falling into it.
And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with their own hand into the interior cavity, if it obeys the withdrawal.
Then he should be laid back on his neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them, and let the incision be according to the amount, so that it is possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Then scrape away the siphak, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is exposed from every side. Then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and sever with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand, and with this extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision, and order the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and you sever the adhesion which is behind, completing the severance.
And examine with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
If however you find anything of it, then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of linen consisting of ten threads, and insert it near the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is beneath the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Then place some of them over others in a cross-like shape, and bind them with the alsifach, of which we spoke, which is under the skin of the testicles with a firm ligature, until no blood vessels that nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess does not occur from it.
And place another ligature again outside the first ligature, distant from it by no more than two fingers.
And after these two ligatures, leave from the siphak, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely along the circumference, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, the incision from which blood and pus runs, as we have described in what was previously said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the ligature that we described.
And sometimes the white sifach that we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
If however its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water: and put on it what we have said, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning the windy Ramus.
Chapter LXVI.
In this Ramus I have not seen anyone who dared to use an iron for its treatment.
And the first ones said that it happens as we have recounted in the Ramus which is with the Vite.
That is, to tie the vessels after the incision upon them with ease from below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat with that which opens it itself, until the vessels fall out; and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it heals.
Concerning the rupture that occurs in the inguinal region.
Chapter LXVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area bulges, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if anything descends, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if the time with it is prolonged, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And that happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
That is because the scrotum stretches; then the area softens, and becomes an abscess, and bulges.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding account stated.
And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is so that the sick person lies on his back between your hands.
Then cut the ulcerated and bulging area of the rupture, with a cut across, to the width of three fingers.
Then tighten the scrotum and what is under the skin until the white scrotum is exposed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it over the protruding area of the scrotum, and press it into the depths of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding areas on the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them to the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal worms. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When therefore you cut the thread, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it consolidates.
For the scrotum contracts, and no protrusion of the rupture is added.
And cauterization is better in this place, since it is closer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because of which the flesh between them softens, and its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, to have the sick man lie on his back, and to cut all the softened skin over the natural skin. Then, he should bring together the two folds with sutures; and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the stitches firm.
Then treat the remaining wounds with care, until they are healed and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law; and because of that, it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine.  And its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, and so that he knows the treatment of whoever has suffered it.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways. Or by rubbing.
Or by splitting and cutting.
In that which is done by rubbing, the method of operation is: that we should place the animal in warm water until its testicles soften and loosen, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer visible to the touch.
In castration by splitting and cutting, you should hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by rubbing, because rubbing perhaps leaves some of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.
One of them is that a space appears in it, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, with hairs; and sometimes urine runs from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one kind, and it is a woman's vulva on the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outwards; one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until their impression disappears.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second kind, however, of men, from which urine issues, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
Concerning the incision of the tentigo, and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo perhaps arises from a natural condition, until it is disfigured and its appearance becomes unsightly; and sometimes in certain women it becomes so large that it expands, as in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Therefore, you should grasp the excess of the tentigo with your hand or with a hook, and make an incision; and do not be overly hasty in the incision, especially into the deep root, so as to avoid a flow of blood.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
However, the flesh that arises is flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges outward, in the likeness of a tail; and because of that, some of the ancients call the illness "tailed.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as we cut tentigo, and to treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, so that it is the vulva of a woman not perforated, or is a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and indeed it is made either from added flesh that grew, or a subtle, or thick sifach: and it is made either in the deep of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or its lower part: and it hinders from intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it hinders menstruation.
And its knowledge is made by the examination of the midwife, if an apparent obstruction is nearby.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the obstruction is from a subtle sifach, and is close to the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
And it is, that you place cushions upon the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be upon her back with her legs spread out.
Then spread the two lips with strength, until the subtle sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it upon the place: and let the woman do this every day, so that the place will not consolidate again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it away with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing a bite, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer a bandage of dry linen, then continue with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes other flesh births occur in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be cut in this manner: since it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, no opposition should be made with iron at all.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubeae in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins, until much blood runs from them constantly.
When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already mentioned their species and signs in the division; and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb over which the sense falls, are those which are cured.
Therefore, it is necessary that you admit the woman into a cold house.
Then, extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then, powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the powdered incisions without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Then, let him/her press his/her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and quince bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If, therefore, blood is drawn out with it, it is good; and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and armpits, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and apply it to the affected area.
When the abscess therefore subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of a rough appearance.
Therefore, you must cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said about the thelil equally: and treat it until it is healed.
Of the perforation of the exit which occurs in the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, carbuncle, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And indeed I have already spoken of all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the division: it is necessary to speak in this treatise of the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Therefore it is necessary to consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its inception is acute with its striking, and heat, and fever, and you see it to redden: if sensibility falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents ceases.
Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats, and she should recline, or be propped up on her back, and she should bring her feet to the lower part of her belly: and her thighs should be spread apart, and she should put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those which are after.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the rod deep into the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument is no more than the depth of the womb, and injures the weak one.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place pads over the covering of the womb's depth, so that the entire instrument's entry into the womb's depth is prevented; and it is necessary that it put a pivot, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side, and that the instrument be held, and that the attendant turn the pivot until the womb's depth is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and it is touched by the hand, and is soft and gentle, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the linen cloth, and extract the section into the womb's depth.
And place externally over the womb, and over the vulva, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the lily root, or long aristolochia, has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inwardly in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, indeed treat it with what we have said in the division.
On the teachings of Midwives, how living embryos are to be treated, having emerged from the womb in a non-natural form.
Chapter LXX.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of natural childbirth.
Therefore, among its signs, when you see a woman pressing downward, and she desires to smell the air, and relief is upon her from that which is upon her concerning childbirth, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this childbirth is according to the natural form, and its exit is above her head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
However, any birth beyond this one is unnatural, and blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one foot; or its head and hands emerge; or the belly emerges; and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar, blameworthy forms.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, astute in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form from among them, and how the nature is in it, and what is signified by it, and how to stand over it.
When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural exit, and it becomes forceful upon the woman, and her labor becomes difficult, and you see her strength already weakened, then have her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her, and vaporize her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it flows out from the moisture; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be enemated with fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Then order her, after the enema, to bear down; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will immediately emerge.
If the first parts of two hands of the fetus emerge, it is necessary that you gently and gradually draw them back.
If however it does not yield at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the rest of the fetus; and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is upon its feet.
When the fetus emerges upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then to turn the fetus gradually; afterwards to equalize it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command that it be compressed, and make it sneeze with application; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then bring back the fetus gradually, until you place it in its natural form.
For it will then emerge with easy exit.
If it is impeded by all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound the whole in a mortar with good pounding; then apply it to the woman's vulva and the lower part of her belly.
Then make her sit in lukewarm water, until she reaches the hypochondria.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then make for her a plaster of myrrh, and apply it.
When therefore the plaster has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze; and pinch her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her belly with gentle pressure.
For the fever will depart immediately.
The exit of the fetus is upon the knees and hands.
When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands.
Then the woman shall lie on her back, and her feet shall hang downwards; and she lie upon the bed, and fold her hands.
Then gently press upon her belly.
Then pull out that which is beneath her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Then press gently on that which is above the hypochondria, until the fetus ascends upwards.
Then let her insert her hands, and gently adjust the fetus: and instruct the woman to bear down, until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus is dependent on the hands' lateral position.
Let his hand be used in the reduction.
If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
If however she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment that you have prepared from the mucilages.
If, however, she receives it by birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and position the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it emerges.
The exit of the fetus is over her neck, with her hands outstretched, and its face is towards the mother's back.
The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and position it easily.
When, therefore, it is positioned, then place upon her vulva what we have described of oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move gradually.
When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to her right side.
Then command her to press herself, and make her sneeze with the preparations.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
When it descends to the opening of the womb in this way, with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it is hanging over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as it should be; and command the woman to press herself several times, for it will emerge through an easy exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not entirely live; and they are contained, although they multiply, by a single afterbirth; and they are separated by a membrane, distinct from each other, tied to the navel of each.
And sometimes they emerge as a single fetus emerges by natural, easy exit; and they emerge by an unusual exit, as we have described. If some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach the unnatural shapes we have mentioned, then treat them as we have described; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and patience, and adapt according to every shape with whatever is prepared for her to lead to their health.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has been verified by me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, all this should be in the knowledge of the Midwife. Perhaps, indeed, it will come to her like that: therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division from medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider.
If, therefore, the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted by any accident from which harm is feared to befall her, then the woman should be laid supine on the bed, upon her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and the attendant should hold her by both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the os uteri with humid oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the uterus with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place where to fasten the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head; then fasten the hooks to its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubis and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand, and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fasten the hook in any of those places which we have said, until it reaches the empty space.
Then it should be extended with equal extension, and the extension should not be only according to straightness, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased; just as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary for that which is between it to be softened by the extension.
If a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so as to revolve that which is retained with them.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be changed to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If therefore a hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, due to its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do for the other hand and the two feet.
If however the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that a prickly Spatumile be inserted between the fingers, and that it split the head with it, and extract the water: or that it be broken with an instrument called Almisdac: the shape of which comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Similarly, he should do so if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary that he cut it with algengematu, or extract it with the misdach, as we said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
If however it does not fold, nor yield to exit, then cut the head into pieces, as much as possible for you.
If the lower abdomen is suppurated, or contains dropsy, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mother's opening is gentle.
If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and to split the belly or chest until that which is within them flows out.
If the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the midwife shall insert her left hand. If therefore the opening of the womb is open, then she shall insert her hand deep into the womb, and seek the head with it, and pull it with her fingers up to the opening of the womb; then insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it with it.
If, however, the opening of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that has occurred there, then it is not necessary to work on it; rather, it is necessary then to administer the effusion of moist, oily things, and to apply plasters; and to sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it; then administer what we have said about a living fetus.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And indeed I have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was; then she became pregnant again over it, afterward another fetus died as well.
Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened, and it began to discharge pus.
I was therefore called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed upon it certain plasters of strong attraction, and the bone came out of the place.
Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
I was therefore amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a stillborn fetus.
Then I inquired about the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her better dispositions; and she has now lived thus for a long time, and sends out little pus from the place.
And I have not established this as extraneous here, unless because there is knowledge and assistance in it, for what the skilled physician administers with his hand in healing.
Concerning the shapes of the necessary instruments in the extraction of the fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the shape of a Strictorium, by which books are equalized, to which there are equally two hinges at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this hinge must be finer than the strictorium: and to be made, either from ebony or from boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers: and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same type of wood, which are already fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two hinges.
The shape of the hinge by which the matrix is opened.
Another form, similar to it, but finer and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of pincers.
However, at its extremity there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm; and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, and the space between her thighs open.
Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix, and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with shears, equally according to the amount of opening you wish of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife achieves what she wants.
Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Form of the Impeller, by which the fetus is impelled.
The Almisdac form with which the small head is crushed. The form of a hook having one spine.
The form of a hook having two spines.
The form of forceps with saw teeth, with which the fetus' head is crushed.
The form of a spatula having two ends for severing the head.
The form of two spatulas, also broad.
All these instruments are used, and the more their kinds are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker is his operation, and the higher is he regarded by men, on account of their quantity.
Therefore do not despise any instrument of them, that it may not be prepared by you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the Secundina.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the Secundina is retained at the birth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to retain her breath.
Then make her sneeze with applications, and grasp your hand over her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it emerges through this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid, and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sseham, cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the lid hole of the pot, and the other end in the woman's womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
However, if it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then she should insert it into the vagina, and seek out the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
If however it is attached deep within the uterus, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually in a straight line, so that the uterus does not fall during forceful traction; rather, it should be moved easily to the right and left sides; then add the amount of traction.
For it then obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
If the opening of the uterus is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with a medicinal pot containing herbs.
If however it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out by repeating the extraction.
But it is necessary that what emerges from it to the opening of the uterus be tied to the woman's hip.
Then administer an enema to her with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will indeed cause it to putrefy after a few days, and it will dissolve and emerge.
However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, having experience, have known the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which to fumigate a woman experiencing retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass, similar to a beaker, or of pottery: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed above the prunas: let it hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which a subtle sifac has already obstructed.
Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife perforate that sifac with her finger: and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her take care that her hand does not touch it.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to void.
And now there occurs obstruction of the anus also from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we have said about treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a Knotting, and a Swelling that occur near the anus externally: or in the space of a single part: and it is one fistula, or several.
When that knotting becomes old, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
And sometimes there are penetrating ones from these fistulas.
And some of them are fistulas, when they are penetrating in the space up to the bladder, and up to the urethra.
And some of them are penetrating up to the hip joint, and up to the tail bone.
By this is known a fistula penetrating to the anus, even if it is not penetrating, that you should insert your index finger into the anus; and insert a thin probe into the fistula from air or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
If there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a thread from horse hair, until you feel the probe or thread on your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything emerge from the opening by way of evacuation, nor wind, nor worm, as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus: then its sign is the discharge of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place is consolidated with medicines.
If however it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone; and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus emerges from it always; and that the medication does not work in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed. However, in that which is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already tested; and it is, so that the sick person lies between your hands upon their back; and elevate their legs up above their hips, and their hips are inclined towards their stomach.
Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If however the sick person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe, already having penetrated by itself detected, beyond what you feel between your finger, and between it and the flesh or the muscle: then you shall know for sure that it is penetrating; therefore do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we said.
However, they have said that flesh heals in some people, and from the medication from which healing is hoped for, it is that you cauterize a fine cautery according to the extent of the fistula, as was mentioned before, and you insert it, hot, into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat it twice, or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh, which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, have been burned.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh tissues come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such a thing happens, and you see a fistula on the surface beneath the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting along with the probe that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh tissues, which resemble the hollow of a bird's quill, so that nothing remains of them.
If, however, blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you may cut those tissues, then it is better, and more quickly helpful, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because a cautery with fire aggregates good habits, burns those added flesh tissues, and stops the flow of blood, and dries up the moisture.
Then treat it with linen strips dipped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the area produces pus, and the burned tissues are discharged in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that generate hard flesh: and these are medicines that possess astringency and drying properties.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear a recurrence. If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from bodily superfluities: then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it is a membrane of sift, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the path of confidence and hope.
For it is treated in one of three ways: either to cauterize it, as we have said; or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and a cure from the proximity.
And do not proceed much with the incision, so that you do not sever the muscle containing the anus, and an unintended outcome of defecation occurs in the sick person. Then treat it with what we have said. Perhaps it will be healed; or you will remove the membrane, and cleanse it after you have incised it close to the anus, as we have said, either with a tenaculum or with another instrument with a sharp end.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh that is in the incision, until you can see clearly with examination.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and an open fistula remains in the interior part of the anus, and it will be less severe on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a tenaculum into the fistula; and it is at the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus; then take a tenaculum with a perforated end, which is like an al-esquef needle, that is, for preparing hides, in this form.
And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and approximately so.
Then insert the tenaculum with thread into the fistula, until it reaches the concavity of it.
If therefore it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together; and tie each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, the more tightly tie it, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you do not have the skill to do this because of the muscle, lest you injure it.
Then do with it as we said, until it is healed.
Shape the lancet, pointed, with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is unnecessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision; and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
For either they are within the anus, like the vesicles of coal or prunes; or like grapes themselves.
And from them are small and large; and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which runs a yellowish water, or little blood with constant flowing; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you should order the sick person to strain; and it should be expressed, until it comes out of the anus, and the athelil appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend them with hooks; or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If, however, the hooks are not retained in them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with wool from doubled fleece, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after the incision, sprinkle some hot powders on them, so that they may act as cauteries.
Or cauterize them according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then administer an enema to the sick person, in which there is a small irritant, so that it may wash out what is in the anus, and yield quickly to evacuation when the patient expels it.
If however the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy:  and it is as if you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them off.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they heal.
And whoever recoils from cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this way.
Take a wound-wrapping thread, and introduce it into the needle.
Then draw the pile upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be sideways; and tighten the pile with a strong constriction.
Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this with all the piles, and leave one of them; nor let it be such that blood flows from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth steeped in rose oil, or oil of cedar, and place it over the anus; and order the sick person to rest.
Then leave it until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
For they often occur from the dryness of excrement and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become chronic and medicine is not effective on them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a sharp spatula or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Then treat them until they consolidate as necessary.
If however they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed profusely and are scraped, then treat them until they heal.
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil and formicae.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation on the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to extend the athelil and cut it; or to bind it with a silk thread, or with a needle, until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously stated with fire or with a sharp medicine, and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted ones with the instrument that I shall name. A formica is also a small, filtered, coarse elevation on the surface of the body, going deep into it; and when cold finds it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt in it, and is produced throughout the body; and most of it occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's quill or a strong vulture's feather, and place that cannula over the Formica, until the cannula's circle encompasses its parts.
Then turn your hand with the cannula until you cut what is around the Formica; and place it deep within the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root. And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the cannula's upper part be drawn upwards, so that the grip and turning of the wrapped and enclosed mass are lightened above the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is previously stated in the cauterization of Atheril in the chapter on the cautery.
Concerning the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for bowel evacuation, and colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast copper, or of hammered copper.
And sometimes it is made of these instruments small and large, according to those with which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, likewise their enemas.
Large enema.
Small enema.
Its tube, that is, the upper head where the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a distinction so that the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawing to a fine point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and the bag in which the medicines are placed should be from the bladder of an animal, or from the parchment of an egg, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
When therefore the bag is placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong tightening.
Then clysterize with it.
And this is the form of the bags here depicted, and of the holes. However, the quality of clysterizing with it is: that you fill the bag, or bladder, with medicine that is heated according to the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not too hot, or too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place beneath them a *inthaan*, that is, a skin upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands simultaneously, and squeeze it vigorously, until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestine. Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall. If the medicine compels him towards an exit, then let him hold it as long as possible.
And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more helpful in the end.
If however you clyster him in illnesses of loose bowels, and his exit is hasty: then clyster again, until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or harmful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, gentle, from the clysters with which children are clystered.
And this be the form of a thin clyster, above which the skin be tight.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division on the treatment of wounds, what was fitting for the book, and I shall say here their treatment with the hand, and with medicines according to the completion.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are often made, are such as the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword, or knife; or the impact with a lance, or wood, or arrow; and similar things from many objects.
And wounds which are made according to the locations of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar ones from those limbs.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, that I may place that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of composite wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome from a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay it; and extract from him the blood according to the amount of his strength; if nothing prevents it from the phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the sick person beware of overeating, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prevents reduction, then reduce the food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, place on the wound a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are certain of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by means of bandages, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
If, however, the wound has already been exposed by the bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspender, then cut it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in it in place of skin, and order the sick person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like pulp; and things similar to them.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away the entire putrefied part, and cast it off; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and it is not severed by medicines, then inquire into the artery.
If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
If necessity compels when what we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
Method of the Flesh-healing Powder.
Take one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be thoroughly ground, and sifted: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it and is clotted with blood.
Then bind it above with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat the rest of it with the other treatment, until they are healed.
Of wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and a wound of the head when it is simple.
However, if a nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment should be avoided with that which causes strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that with which it is treated from medicines be gentle, such as lime washed with fresh water, sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuttia, when washed also with fresh water: and the other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with plasters.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
If indeed an artery has been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
If however the spondyles of the throat, or the whole, have been incised, and the other parts have been saved: then bring the lips of the skin together with sutures over the reed of the throat, and do not touch the throat, rather, straighten it and restore it to its natural form.
Then bind it with a suitable constriction, and leave it for a few days.
Then treat it with ointments which have astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
If however the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound becomes putrid, and its discharge is separated and relieved.
If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
If however a bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which is recalled in its chapter.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
If therefore wind issues forth from the wound, when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If it does not have depth, and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, lest the blood be retained in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the sick person: but put attractive ointment on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not present for you, then put old spittle into the wound opening, so that it may suck that which issues from it of moistures: and make the sick person sleep on the wound, so that that which collects in it may run.
If, however, three days or more have already passed since the wound, and the sick person does not experience spasms, nor a bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of his/her condition good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat him/her with bandages and the other treatments, until he/she is healed.
If, however, his/her healing is excused, and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Therefore, treat it from its own chapter.
And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with the preceding suture if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and chipped fragments from it: then examine the wound, and hurry to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
If however they are not separated, then leave them until the wound suppurates, for their extraction will be eased.
However, for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the judgment we have stated.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Chapter LXXXVII.
Rupture which happens to the belly is great, medium, and small.
From a great one therefore sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, why does their introduction occur, and their suture more vehement and difficult?
And small rupture also occurs difficult in another way.
Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hurry in their introduction to their place immediately, because it is inflated, opened, and thickened; therefore, its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, a middle rupture is better, because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types.
Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common sutures agree with the suture of the belly, and with the suture of the other wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly agree with the other wounds.
However, they are more proper with the suture of the belly; and I tell you each one with an explanation and a declaration. Therefore, I say that when a wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is because of one of two ways.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine on account of the cold air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a wet cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Or boil it in water with squinants, and cyperus, and spike, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mallow has been boiled.
For by it the entrance of it is relieved with a small thing.
If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when prepared than the incision: and there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and the instrument's failure.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the thin end not be as thin as a spatula, but rather somewhat blunt: and it is that which resembles a caecum, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible upon it; because it is better.
When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then raise his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your intent and your consideration always to this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary that you apply it in large wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious assistant present, who shall hold the entire rupture with his hand; and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it to him who follows in the suture something after something: and this is the mode of a single common suture.
And it is that you should take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's size.
Then withdraw from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician; and fix one needle beyond that into which you shall insert a thread at both ends of the skin, with both ends of the thread that are beneath the skin from the inside, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you shall have already brought together the two extremities of the skin, and the two ends of the thread; and four orders are formed.
Then tighten with the doubled thread in a circle around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until both lips of the wound are brought together with a decent closure.
Then withdraw a thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards tie it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
And let the needles be of a medium thickness, between thick and thin; because very thin needles pierce flesh very quickly, and thick needles are difficult to enter the skin; for this reason it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two closely situated extremities of the skin too much; so that the flesh is not pierced quickly, and the wound is opened before its healing, and they should not be pulled too far with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the patient in their sleep; and place cushions of cloth all around them, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
And this method of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Because one or two, or approximately that number of, needles suffice in their suture.
However, the second common suture is to bring together four extremities with the suture: two extremities of skin, and two extremities of the si-fac in a single turn, with a needle in which a thread wrapped around it is equal in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture will be like the suture of a cloth where cloths are tied together, and place between each suture a quantity less than the thickness of a little finger.
This suture, however, is known to men.
And with this suture I healed a wound which had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound's rupture was greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed; and he lived after that for many years, occupied in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not recover.
And it was a marvel that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment or any medicine could be found.
Therefore I placed an old poultice upon the wound twice a day, and I assiduously washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
However, I shall describe two proper kinds of sutures according to the narration of the discourse.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture, and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle extending according to the length and width of the whole body: leave the end as it was on the side in which you inserted the needle, and cause it to penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other end mirach.
When therefore you have caused it to penetrate, then cause it to penetrate in this same end mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the end sifac, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer: and cause it to penetrate with your penetration as you cause it to penetrate in the sifac end mirach, which is on its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end, which is from sifac to the other side, and pull the needle out of the skin which it has penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the sifac end, which is on the other side, with this mirach end: and pull it out of the skin which is on its side, and do it one time, and another: and do it time after time, until you have sewn the whole exterior according to that example.
And the perfection of this suture is that it should resemble the sutures of leather workers when they sew skins: so that you sew sifac once on one side of one skin end: and that you leave it another time on the other side, until you complete it.
Second kind of proper suture, which Galen said.
His speech relates that one should sew it according to the manner in which certain physicians sew them, so that they bring every part to its fitting counterpart by nature: and they apply the sifac end to its other end, and the mirach end to its other end.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
You must place the needle into the mirach end nearest you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and leave the two sifac ends.
Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two sifac ends, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make them penetrate both from the inside to the outside, in the two other mirach ends, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose remembrance has preceded.
This is therefore also Galen's speech.
And some said.
The belly suture is rectified with two needles.
That is, to insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
However, the judgment of the treatment of a wound is like the judgment of other wounds.
That is, when you encounter a fresh wound with its blood, before air alters it; and you reduce the intestine and sew it, and fit it: then put over it a flesh-producing powder.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it some ointments that are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall away, and it is consolidated, and it is mirach.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds, until it is healed.
However, if the medicines are not present to you, then place upon it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old wool: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound may communicate with the principal limbs in the injury, then it is necessary that you soak soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the places that are between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then inject him with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putridity has already reached the intestine, and has made a penetrating exit to its cavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small one, of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound which occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nervous nature.
If, however, that which issues from the wound is a zirbum, and you catch it fresh, return it according to your method of returning intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green, or black: then it is necessary to tie it with thread above the place which has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in a zirbum there are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the pulling of it, and its extraction in the case of a zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus, may be alleviated.
A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some men; because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and it became a fistula, and excretion and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; nor did I cease to refine it until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, that a bad accident would befall him in his belly; and no bad accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
And now certain experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is necessary that it be bound in this manner.
And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those having an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it takes hold upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and will not be loosened.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm befalls the sick person at all. And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and it is scraped much.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it to the rupture. And this method of suturing with ants and intestines is not except according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy but refinement, nor is its healing at all.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound, or abscess, when it becomes old and aged, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus continually, and is not cut away: then it is universally called a Fistula, wherever it may be on the body, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, indeed, is in truth a filtered, hard, white knot: with which there is no pain, which has the hollowness of a bird's feather; and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And it is in some hours moist, which emits pus.
And perhaps the moisture is cut open in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and is scant; and is thick, and is thin.
And I have already stated in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh between it and the lips of it, hindering the birth of flesh; or because of much filth and grime; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment; or because corruption falling into the region is a kind of plague, or by its property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where difficult digestion of illnesses occurs, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Therefore know that Fistula happens in all the members of the body.
For from them are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs; or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of composite structures, such as the hand and foot; and from them are those that go to the proximity of the main member, and similar ones.
Therefore, which of these fistulas is in this manner, is from illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
If, however, there is a fistula whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its treatment, and you wish to arrive at a knowledge of it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
If however there is a twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Because lead, with the gentleness of its body, is alleviated and curves around the twisting.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate from those openings of its openings.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it, goes toward the other openings, and flows out of them.
Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to know if there is a bone, or a nerve, and the fistula's cavity is deep or shallow; or if it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over all of it with all your strength, with your questioning, in which you question the sick person, and with the finding of pain from the compression with your hand over the place, and with similar signs and causes that occur with abscesses.
When you have stood over all those places in the correct position, then proceed to the treatment with confidence, and consider whether the fistula is shallow and apparent, or in a safe place far from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or any of the places I have told you about; then cut the fistula as mentioned in my explanation, and remove what is in it through filtration, and the rotten flesh, that comes forth in its opening from the flesh, or pustules, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the fistula is deep and extensive, then it is necessary to cut it as deeply as possible.
Then cleanse it of all its rotten flesh.
Then apply strips soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you grasped with the iron; do this with them several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed by you, then seek it out and cut it, as I have told you: if nothing prevents you, such as a vein, a nerve, or a principal member, as we have said.
If therefore bone is discovered by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its entire corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again and thoroughly make its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If, therefore, it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in the distant depths of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully draw out all of them, and do not leave any behind with your strength.
If, however, some moisture resists you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those moistures and the flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
If, however, you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound something to rot it, and leave it until that which is around those bones of flesh and moisture rots.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And bind the incision that you have made in your operation.
Indeed, place over it, if you fear it, a poultice soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil; or a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointments.
For when those humidities, namely, rot and are separated from them, the bones, the removal and drawing of them will be eased.
However, if it is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg, or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then shave it with the utmost care until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
However, if that which is corrupted within it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it is healed. And I tell you a story, which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and aid for your operation.
There was a young man of about thirty years, to whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause which arose within his body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became a large abscess; and there was no external cause.
Therefore, time passed with the doctors' error, until the abscess was opened, and many materials escaped with it.
And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; which all emitted pus and the body's humors.
Therefore, many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skillful one in the art of medicine among them, until I was called, and saw his leg, and the materials that ran from those openings with great flow: indeed, the entire man's body was now putrid, and his complexion was yellow.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found that they reached one another from every part of the leg. I therefore hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I therefore removed what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption, which I cut away and removed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except on account of the disposition of the weakened patient, and the paucity of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death; because it happened to him at all hours, from an excess of evacuations, evil syncopes.
Therefore, he was healed with a complete cure: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good condition was established in his body, and his strength returned: and he returned to his usual condition; and no impediment occurred to him in walking at all.
If, however, a prominent bone in a fractured part of the body exists, then it is necessary to saw it, in this manner: and it is that you take a ligament, and tighten it on the end of the prominent bone; and command someone to extend it upwards; and place another thicker wool ligament over the first ligament. Then bind it over the flesh that is under the bone; and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards; and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood or a board beneath the bone appropriately below, for when you do this, it does not prevent the cutting of the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a little while, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels sawing in another instance. If the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely.
Then place wood beneath.
Afterwards, saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other part; and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption for a little while, as we said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the arch of the hand, or in the arch of the foot, then the matter is very difficult in it.
But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever disposition is possible for you, and with whatever remedy rectifies itself for you: when it does not cause you opposition from a vein or a nerve.
And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for each type of operation.
And know that these operations will show you the type of instrument you need, when you have long study with them.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find for yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments for every infirmity.
Saw shape.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
This shape of the saw, be made fittingly. Let its upper arch be sharpness of iron, and its handle of boxwood, and be a pyramid, fittingly made.
Shape of the connections of the razor.
Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a chisel.
And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the middle razor.
Shape of the broad razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other, slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small, slender, drawn razor.
Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Shape also of a large razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw: it is shown in many places from the cutting of bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for cutting that which is perforated from the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp ends.
It is made of India.
And likewise, all those things which we have said should be made from razors, and knives, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Chapter Eighty-nine.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help; and you see corruption entering the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you cut off that limb, up to where the corruption reaches, so that it may escape infirmity by it, or from the evil that is greater than the loss of the limb.
And the sign that this happens to is that the limb darkens until it stinks; that fire has burned it, or that it putrefies after the darkening: until that putrefaction is cut off up to that which follows that limb, and spreads throughout the whole body.
Therefore, hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and adder, and the like.
If therefore the corruption, or the injury, is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to advance to the rest of the hand.
And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it seizes the forearm.
And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint. If, however, the corruption passes, and you see it about the elbow, then in that is the death of the sick person.
And to administer beyond that from treatment, is the measure of virtue.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it seizes the arch of the foot, then cut the entire foot.
If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
If, however, the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the way of cutting a limb, or sawing it, is that you should tighten the ligament below the one you want to cut; and tighten another ligament above the place.
And let the attendant extend one ligament downwards; and let the attendant extend the other ligament upwards.
And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it is cut, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloths from all sides, and that the saw does not touch a healthy part; and that a further injury and a hot abscess may befall the sick person.
If however an internal bleeding occurs while you are working, then cauterize the place quickly; or put upon it some powders that staunch the blood.
Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable for it, and care for it until it heals.
And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, this same event which I relate to you.
That is, because it happened in his foot as a blackness, with a burning like the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened himself, after he saw the corruption fall upon the limb with its violence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it fell upon the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. So he came to me, and I attempted to recover that superfluity with what I put upon his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a repulsion of that superfluity from me: and I also feared death for him in the cutting of his hand.
Because the man's strength was over the case.
After he therefore despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me of him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I did not bring this account, except that it may be an aid concerning that which falls from the kind of this sickness: and that it may be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is pierced, and that which is within it of pus emerges, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin over it is like a cloth that has already become thin: and it does not reach the ultimate stage of corruption, nor does it impinge on the mouth, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption impinges on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is, that you should cut that entire skin as it is turned: and especially when it is thinned, and made like a cloth: and you trust that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
If however you hope that the skin will adhere, and that corruption does not follow from that ultimate consequence: and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and it is, that you should consider towards the Sinus.
Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, which are combined in a vessel: and boil them over fire, until the medicine reddens: and comes to the consistency of honey.
Then take from that which you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the Sinus with it: and bind its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure: do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is enematized with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you: and it is that you should take the ash of vine wood, or the ash from the holm oak wood: and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and enema with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
If the sick person does not have tolerance for the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then enema it with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Or enema it with mixed honey and wine, since it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash: and wine causes the Sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done it several times, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed: then enema it with that which causes flesh to grow there.
And it is, that you should take from the dyafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine: or enema it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, in which the enema tube does not fit: then enlarge it a little with iron: or put on it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it is enlarged.
And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and leave it the quantity into which the clyster will enter without addition.
And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated upwards: then cut it in the lower place which is in it, so that pus runs from it downwards: because pus, when it is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, prevents flesh from growing there.
If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus approximately below the place you want: then try to prepare the limb by a preparation whereby pus runs from it easily as you are prepared.
Try to prevent any pus from being retained there: and take the consolidating medicines which are placed over the sign, appropriate to what you want.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire Sinus.
Then cut with scissors a hole in the direct opening of the Sinus, a little wider than the opening of the Sinus.
Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over it, at a distance from the opening of the Sinus, so that the pus may be more easily discharged from it; and do not remove the large cloth unless after a few days at one time.
However, the one over the opening of the Sinus is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out; and so that you may know if the fluid flowing from it is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its master feels pain in it, or not, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.
Therefore, when your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the material that is discharged over the opening of the Sinus, then you should know that the Sinus is now adhering, or is approaching adhesion; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment. However, if a thin fluid discharges from the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is near, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
If, however, undigested pus discharges from the Sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged, then add to the drying medicines, but let the physicians ensure that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their potency, such as the ointment of diaphynicon, when superfluity of addition is added to it from zegi.
And from the more final means of its cure, is that you take the ointment of dyafinicon, and it be dissolved with rose oil, and ancient wine be sprinkled over it, equal in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it performs a similar action to this, when you do not have the ointment of dyafinicon present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is on the fire.
Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and line it with the honey you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily itself, and the herb's flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Use them, simple or aggregated, grind them, and sift them: and powder them over the honey that I have spoken of, and use it.
If the sinus condition persists and is not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is now making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of Fistulas, as has been previously described. Concerning the treatment of whitlow and the worn-out nail, and the incision of the added finger, and the section.
Chapter XCI.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps arises on the other fingers.
When therefore its condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted and emits pus until it gnaws away the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the entire nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it, with what we have said in division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut with an iron the entire excess remaining from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail now compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary to place a thin radium under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and place upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
If however corruption has already impressed itself upon the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it; for it will never be healed while corrupted bone remains in it.
If you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to the remembrance of its preceding description.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, there is a rubbing or striking of the nail, and a severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the infirm person.
Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatumili in a transverse cut from top to bottom.
And take care that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause great pain to the infirm person through it, and it will be the cause of the birth of additional flesh in that place.
Then treat the place with that which relieves pain.
The extra finger which is born in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some of them have bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some of the finger's knots.
Therefore, the one that is born in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that is born near the finger's joint perhaps moves.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
Which is, that you should cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of the one whose origin is in the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from its incision.
However, in that which arises in the finger at the last nodes, then it is necessary to cut its flesh first, with a round incision, until the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
The consolidation, however, which happens to fingers together, happens often either from the birth of a man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or the burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, between them: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them: or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the place is consolidated as it ought to be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Ulcers are veins that are wrapped, thick, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many members of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and those who labor, and those who carry loads.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black bile occasionally with a strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient's basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron, is according to two methods.
One of them is that they should be cut, and the black blood extracted.
And the other method is that the vein should be raised, and the whole of it extracted.
However, its section is according to this method.
First, bathe the leg with much hot water until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh, down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the nail until below, until the amount of blood you see is sufficient and the patient's strength can tolerate it.
Afterwards, tie it; and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
However, its elevation is in this manner.
Shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs on it.
Then immerse it in a bath; or apply a warm water embrocation to his leg until it turns red, and the veins bulge; or have him exercise vigorously, if a bath is not available, until the limb warms up.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to the senses; and at its appearance, you will see it slope from red to black.
When it emerges from the skin, you see it white like a string.
Then introduce a probe underneath it, until when it is lifted and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, by three fingers.
Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Then lift it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Then lift, and cut it with the last incision at the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision above it.
And do this until you pull it out of the incision that is above, or higher than all the other incisions, until the whole thing comes out; then cut it.
However, if it does not yield to pulling and lifting, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a reed under it, and revolve your hand in every direction until it comes out.
And be careful not to cut it.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and it enters upon the weak from it injury.
When therefore you have pulled it all out, then place on the wound a wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is a wrapping around the parts, and it is not, as we said, according to straightness, then it is necessary to cut upon it in every direction of its twisting and its wrapping.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it entirely, and be careful at your cutting upon it lest you strike a vein or wound it, for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
Form of the Incision by which the Vine is healed.
Form of the blind hook.
It does not have a curve like the other hooks, nor a sharp tip so as not to wound a vein; and it has a thick, smooth bend, for if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness; indeed, it should have superfluous thickness, as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in legs in hot lands, such as the Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little tenderness, that is, in which no grass grows, nor any tree.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that happens beneath the skin, just as happen within the bodies of snakes and worms, ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a severe inflammation happens in the leg.
Then the area becomes blistered.
Then the vein begins to emerge from the location of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one drachma keil to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever therefore something emerges from it outward, wrap that in lead, and tie it.
If it extends too far, then cut off part of it and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it off at the root before the whole of it emerges.
For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it is necessary that it be gently drawn out gradually until the last part of it emerges, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein, in some men, emerges what is five palms and ten in its length.
And it has already come to me that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
However, if it is incised during your hour of treatment, then insert a probe into its opening and pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until all that is in it is evacuated from the material; and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for a few days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore, treat it as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Chapter XCIV.
This disease is called in some land among us Cattle Disease; because it often happens to oxen, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it shows itself to the senses by its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts wherever it bursts a place in the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and ascarides, occur in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice.
Because when it goes through the body, and is raised to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens there and emerges, and destroys the eye: and that happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to treat it and extract it, then it is not done except through its movement and its appearance to the sense.
Therefore, it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery on the place with fire, until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said. If, however, you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the sick person use cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve the bad, putrid humours.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the illness Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in some limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
I was called to a woman who was ill in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I had stayed an hour, I saw one swelling move with a twitch, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible; so that it was like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner.
However, I have seen many who experience pain changing from limb to limb; and I did not see it with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is otherwise, except because she was from those who are of dry bodies, detected veins: hence, that windy quality is revealed to the senses by that changing quality.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
When therefore you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain: then if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then press above it, and beneath it quickly; and cut above it, until that constrained windiness comes out; and cauterize the place.
If however you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and quiets them with foul pills, and pills of hellebore, and similar things.
Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows vary according to their types and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Their diversity is such that some have large points, and small: and concave, and blunt.
And some of them have three angles.
And some of them have tongues.
And some of them have stars.
Those, however, that are according to the limbs on which they fall, are according to two ways.
For either the limbs are from the principal concave limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and those like them.
Therefore, when it falls into any of these limbs, and signs of death appear to you, which I shall tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in whomever it is, in many dispositions.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and exits through the siphac which is over the brain, are: because vehement sweat, and scotomia, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera occur from it.
And perhaps blood will exit from the nostrils, or the ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice destroyed.
And white moisture like gruel exits from the wound site.
And from it exits something similar to the watery substance of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that the person feels as if it is fixed in a hard object, not an empty one.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood flows from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore, that death is undoubtedly approaching.
And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the patient's complexion changes.
And he breathes out a great, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow strikes the covering, which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great gasp with violent pain, with a sigh; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps some undigested food will issue from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and is lodged in it, something of excrement, or zirb, or intestine, already ruptured, will issue from the wound.
Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine escapes, and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness: then know that it is mortal.
However, the remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, armpit, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, hip, leg, and similar limbs are saved according to several methods when the arrow does not strike an artery, or nerve, and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may understand through it your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I pulled it out of him on the other side, under the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
And I pulled out another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid.  The arrow was already hidden, and I only recovered a small portion of it, with which it adheres to its shaft.  It was a large arrow, from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, and it had no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil accident occurred to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arab arrow, and it is of the kind that has ears.
Therefore, I cut above it between the two guide-pieces.  And it was already submerged in his throat.
So I worked carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had lodged in his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed over him, and nothing had changed regarding his condition, I cut above the arrow: and I worked on it, and I extracted it; and he was healed, and no ill accident happened to him.
And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound upon it was healed.
After therefore seven years had passed, an arrow emerged at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound upon it was healed, and the arrow remained within her; and no change was made in her condition, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, on whom an arrow had fallen on his face; and the wound was healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain; and many similar cases like these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already bent slightly to the right side; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Therefore, I was called to treat him after the arrow's fall, for up to three days.
Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Therefore, I sought it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and indeed he felt a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Therefore, I hoped that that prick was from the tip of the arrow.
Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster that had attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would suppurate and that the arrowhead would show, so that I might cut upon it; and it did not happen that an event signifying that the arrow had entered the area occurred.
Therefore, I applied the plaster to him for many days; and no event occurred, and the wound meanwhile consolidated; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, and I felt the slender tip of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the tip of the arrow became visible to us; and about four months passed with him during that time.
Then, after the wound had become enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not yield to removal; then I did not cease to refine and devise methods regarding it, until on a certain day I began to use properly made forceps, according to the form they will have at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sick man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place it as a rule and meaning upon that which I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by the narrative; nor does that book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares little with much: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument among the descents of foreign things of this art when they occur.
I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed, except according to two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the contrary of another part.
And that which emerges from where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is pulled, and emerges.
If it does not yield to exit at the time it strikes, then it is necessary that you leave it for a few days, until the flesh around it has rotted: and its traction is relieved, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in the bone, and does not obey you for exit, then leave it also for a few days: and repeatedly treat it with traction and movement every day, until it exits.
If it does not yield to exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine awl, until the arrow's grip is loosened.
Then pull it, and extract it.
However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the ills that I have mentioned appear from the injured person, then abstain from pulling the arrow and leave it, until its condition is equal after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the injured person remains for several days, and nothing of those ills happens to him: then proceed in the pulling of the arrow and its extraction.
However, if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you in pulling: then administer a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes.
If, however, you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
If, however, you cannot get at it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge upon it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If, however, there are ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by all the means that you can, and if means, if it cannot be freed by the separation of the flesh, or by the fracture or twisting of the ears, until it escapes.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape; and use the utmost delicacy, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot get at it within one hour, then leave it for a few days, until the surrounding tissues become putrid.
Then try again: for it will be easier afterward.  If, however, the flow of blood causes you difficulty, then administer what we have said about its treatment in the relevant chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And use all the means possible to you for the escape of the arrow; and let it be with ease and calmness, or with slowness and firmness, as I have instructed you.
And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that it be weak according to the shape in which the arrow was lodged.
Because it is more helpful.
If, however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the figures.
However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side, either something is already protruding outwards; or the arrow's tip causes a bulge on the surface of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding; therefore, cut over it, and let the cut be according to the size that the forceps can take.
Then pull it: for it then becomes easy to extract.
If however it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is pressed into the bone and enlarges itself; then pull it.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again until it emerges.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then drive it out with it.
If however the shaft has fallen away, and you wish to administer an impulse, then introduce a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then drive it out with it.
If however the arrow is concave, then drive it out with an instrument that enters it.
For the arrow is eased by it.
If however the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize the whole flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or belly, or bladder, or flank; and is near to what you touch with your probe, and you can cut above it; then cut and beware of cutting a vein or nerve and extract it.
Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many forms of them are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
The shape of the impelling concave.
And the shape of the impelling deaf.
This is a deaf extremity, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
The extremity of this impelling concave is concave like a bird's feather, so that the arrow's entrance into it and its impulse may be eased.
Of the phlebotomy of the veins.
Chapter XCVII. The veins to be bled, whose custom has run through the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called two Herbs; and two arteries, which are visible in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called Looking; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the end of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins which are opened by phlebotomy in the arms are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the head vein.
And the Fusca.
And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the body vein.
And the Basilica, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called the Tickler.
And the common people call it the belly vein.
And the Arm Cord, and it is situated above the fold: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear appearance.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot are three veins.
One of them is which is under the curve of the thumb from the wild side.
And the second is Saphena: and its place is at the heel from the domestic side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel from the wild side.
And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
Concerning phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins located behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and hemiplegia, and headache, and old, troublesome ulcers of the head.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is as I describe.
And it is that the head of the sick person be shaved, and his occiput be rubbed in the location of the two veins with a rough cloth by good friction.
Then let the sick person tighten his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears, in two depressed areas of the head.
Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark it with ink there.
Then take a lancet, and that is called the incisor.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the lancet reaches the opening.
Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incisive incision.
And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two joined fingers, or about that; and cause as much blood to issue forth as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it is healed.
And now, at the beginning of the book, the incision of those, and their cauterization, has preceded.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is helpful for old hemiplegia; and for crookedness of the neck, and constant ophthalmia; and for the excessive flow of acute secretions to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is as I tell you.
Let the sick person stretch his neck a great deal, until two veins become distinctly visible to the eye; and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger.
Then mark the signs with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet cutting underneath, and lift the vein upwards.
And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and cause blood to flow according to your need. Then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger over the vein for an hour.
Afterwards, place a bandage and pads over it, and bind it tightly over the constriction: and leave it until it heals.
And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction were previously mentioned at the beginning of the book.
Concerning the venesection of the frontal vein after the venesection of the cephalic vein.
Indeed, the benefit of venesection of the frontal vein after venesection of the cephalic vein is for ancient facial ailments: and for hemicrania, and redness, and foul ulcers.
And its quality of venesection is, according to what I tell you.
The sick man binds his neck with a strip, until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called a Fossorium.
Whose this is the form.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium above the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with something else in its manner; and let the blood flow according to the amount you wish.
Then release the wound of the sick person, and bind it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotom.
However, it is not necessary that it be a phlebotom of sharp tip, like the other phlebotoms, but rather one of broad tip.
And lance it across [the wound], since the bone is close by; and perhaps the phlebotom will break in it when it is slender.
Concerning the lancing of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The aid of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness; and for a speck in the eye, and for illnesses of the face.
And the quality of their lancing is such that the weak person should constrict their neck with a bandage.
Then lance them; and you stand above their head.
And the lancing should be done transversely, a little lengthwise, with a small, somewhat broad lancet, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the lancet is of a slender form, it might perhaps break.
Then make the blood flow as much as is necessary for you.
And place a compress on them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Concerning the lancing of the veins of the nose.
The lancing of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and illnesses of the face, such as migraine, and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is longstanding.
And the quality of its bloodletting is such that the weak person tightens their neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of his nostril, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Since the vein is not visible to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and cause blood to flow according to your need.
Then tie it with a single bandage.
For it (the wound) heals quickly.
On the phlebotomy of the veins of Guidegi.
Indeed, the phlebotomy of Guidegi's veins is a help for constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, herpes estiomenes.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that the weak man is tied up under both his neck with a bandage; and the craftsman stands over the sick man's head, and the sick man is seated on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to the length of a wide phlebotomy for a short time.
Then draw from the blood a moderate amount, or according to what you see is necessary for that.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction, so that the sick person is not suffocated.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound is healed.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins, Algeberich.
The veins, however, according to Algeberich, are a help in phlebotomy, because they contribute to ulcers in the mouth and the corruption of the gums; and bad ulcers; and cracks in the lips and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose and around it.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that you should make the infirm person sit before you, and bind his neck with a bandage.
Then, turn back his lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on its left side; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both.
And that is true, because around them are small, black veins.
Therefore, cut each with a single incision. However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger and more evident of them.
And likewise do with the two veins that are in the upper lip; and indeed custom runs most with it; and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic veins.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the constrictions that are in the throat, and the ailment of the uvula, and the ailments of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person should sit between your hands in front of the sun; and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it a vein, and on the other side of it a vein; and the color of each is sloping towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize each one; and guard, lest you put your hand too far in phlebotomizing them.
For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
However, the three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those whose phlebotomy has become customary in all people.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or with an olive-shaped one, of a sloping thinness: or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
So Alnesil is, which is suitable for cutting.
And from them are broad and thin varieties according to the width and narrowness of the veins.  The form of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of smaller width and finer extremities.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
Of the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help for phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be above fear from it, for an artery is below it.
Therefore, if he errs, and adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and a flood of blood will occur.
Therefore, it is necessary, that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy-piercing instrument; rather, let him cut it with an Alnesil.
If the Basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to leave it alone and shift to another, or seek one of its branches; or phlebotomize the Brachial vein in its place.
For it is indeed clear, and cut it with the phlebotomy Anesil, as we said.
If however you wish phlebotomy of the same, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place until you recognize the place of the pulse.
Then mark the place with encaustic, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the phlebotomy Alnesil, as we said.
And be careful that the blow does not fall through a space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you constrict the ligature, inflation in the place that you marked with encaustic, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like a child's urine, and it is subtle, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Then quickly place your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If, therefore, blood is cut (for it is often cut), then constrict the arm, and release it; and let the sick person beware of its movement; and let it be above their fear.
And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If, however, the blood is not cut, and it overcomes you; and there is no medicine present to you at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut.
Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it; take one half, and constrict it over the place of the vein's constriction, fittingly, with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Then if the blood is cut, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with him whose preceding account of removing the flow of blood from the powder locations: and the excision of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small location of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Of the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
The phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is beneficial, drawing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalica, as we said.
And it befits the phlebotomist to be wary of his phlebotomy, for there is a nerve beneath it.
Therefore, if the phlebotomist adds to the puncture, and finds a nerve, numbness results, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
And this nerve often appears to the senses.
However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you position your phlebotomy, using it to cut, with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Of the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to ailments of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein, if you wish, to prick it with an olive-wood lancet or a myrtle lancet, because it is safer than all other veins, since there is no artery or nerve underneath. However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy to avoid striking only the head of the muscle, and to seek a softer location; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first strike, so that it may be struck again with the lancet several times. However, perhaps it becomes inflamed in some people when it is not lanced on the first strike, but that inflammation does not harm them in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and its resulting complications, about which you should be concerned.
First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and protection from the arrival of diseases.
And that phlebotomy is performed in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Basilic, and the Median cubital vein.
And that phlebotomy is performed at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in Spring and Summer; and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed of the day.
However, phlebotomy performed in illnesses does not have a fixed time; but when convenience and necessity prompt it, by night, or by day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled, regardless of the reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines beforehand with a mild clyster, if there is much retained fecal matter, so that the veins, during phlebotomy, do not draw putrid, harmful superfluities from the intestines to the principal members.
Nor should a patient suffering from a nausea-inducing fullness, nor one suffering from indigestion, nor one recovering from intoxication be bled until that condition has been removed from them.
Nor a sick person with dropsy.
And phlebotomy should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that dissolves the strength from the body or animal.
Then consider in the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to have it.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing hinders him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all bad animal accidents: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive sexual activity, and those similar to them.
And let him have present at his seat things with whose use the custom of men has run from aromatics, and scents, and dances, and things similar to them, in as great a quantity as possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterward, let him extend his arm and rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Then tie the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is unequal, or excessive in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in its relaxation, then also it hinders the flow of blood.
Then, after the constriction, the phlebotomist should rub his hands together until the veins swell and are apparent to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil.
Then he should place his left index finger on the vein itself, just below the place where he intends to phlebotomize, a little bit; so that the vein does not flee, and the puncture fails.
Because from the veins, some are like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy; and from them is one that is full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotom on it, it contracts under the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is narrow. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should lay down the phlebotom.
And if not, then repeat it another time below that place a little, or above it with haste, if the place is not ulcerated.
If, however, it becomes ulcerated, or the patient becomes fearful, then leave him for a day or two days, and do not tighten the ligature.
For perhaps it will attract a hot abscess.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat bloodletting, if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired quantity of blood will not escape, then repeat bloodletting in the same opening according to its alignment, and add a little in the procedure.
And do it quickly, before the place becomes an abscess, for in many people a small operation causes the place to become an abscess.
If therefore you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat the procedure on it at all, for it will not excuse anything in your favor. And place something of olive dregs upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer olive dregs in all your phlebotomies, through which you make blood vessels stop flowing: and Tyriac alfarach and sagzenea do this, when put on the location from either of them.
For blood is made thinner and is resolved when it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially in one who is not a phlebotomist at that time, or if the opening of the vein is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little, over the area, and hold it for an hour, because it is dissolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
And often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at phlebotomies of the Basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon compressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Therefore, be careful to place something from what we have said upon it.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that which has astringency, so that the place may become hardened.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it be allowed to exit, until it becomes red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein's phlebotomy be broadened, and that the phlebotomist be wide; and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that which is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow, and from the incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
And to one who is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary to give food before the phlebotomy of moderate bread soaked in pomegranate water; or secaniabin, if it is heated; and to extract from his blood in three or four stages.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then he should take bread soaked in miua syrup, or in syrup of spiced honey, or in fragrant aromatic syrup before the phlebotomy.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he take in a drink of meat water and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let him use aromatics with algalia, and let his chest be smeared with it; and let him use the rest which we have mentioned in the division on fainting in the chapter on evacuation.
Whoever wants to purge his arm and release his blood a second time, it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation and whose strength is weak, that he release his blood gradually according to the quantity of his strength in successive days.
However, whoever wants to purge his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that he be purged on the second or third day.
However, in whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causing fever, it is necessary that blood depart from it in one time and a large quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs.
And it is not fitting, when you wish to purge the arm and release blood a second time, when the vein's opening is already closed and the blood's exit is difficult, to press upon it with violence, and to quickly bend or stretch it.
For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it until the phlebotomy is performed a second time.
Or remove with sharpness the clotted blood from the vein's opening and put some dissolved salt in water upon it.
And place something of tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, upon it, and apply gentle pressure until the blood emerges.
If, however, the vein has already become inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
If, however, necessity compels you to release the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another vein in the other arm.
The arm's vein is to be phlebotomized at the place of the Basilic vein and the Cephalic vein, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens, and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be tied above it with a ligature of medium tightness.
Then, phlebotomize it transversely, gradually, not laterally, nor longitudinally; and let the opening be ample, and let your phlebotomy be just above the wrist joint for a short time.
And indeed, the greatest amount of blood flow is placed in warm water in winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should tie the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible to the sense.
Then pierce it transversely.
And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And be careful not to injure your hand with the lancet.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, exposed from the flesh.
Then return your hand to the warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the vein's opening, and its flow will be prevented.
When you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it will not solidify quickly.
And similarly, you should do the same with every constricted branch.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and similarly, do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, equally.
The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and retention of menses, and infirmities of the kidneys, and ulcers of the hips and legs that are old, and similar ailments.
And the method of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water, and make friction upon it until the veins protrude; and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
And indeed, the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe; and from it branches out many branches on the front of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence; because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the front of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the front of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy instrument so that you phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
If, however, the exit of blood is obstructed, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
And the aid of phlebotomy for it is, for the pain of the hip, when it is because of hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should enter a bath and hurry; and tighten his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers, with a long thin strip: for it does not appear except because of that.
When it therefore appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it in whatever way is possible for you, or in a transverse manner; and it is better to cut it with an incision, or to sever it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then the phlebotomist should cut some branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of nerves, and make the blood run in the amount you wish.
Then loosen the tightening, and place a leather over the phlebotomy site, and tighten the area.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cupping vessels are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
One is with scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or indeed it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And cuppings that are administered with scarification and blood extraction are fourteen places on the body.
Of which one is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings Alhagdahim, and they are two in the neck, from both sides simultaneously; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of Alachosos at the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two shins.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small, scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that, no strength is lost from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from fullness until the entire body has been emptied.
If necessity prompts cupping for an illness, or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time.
This is because there are people who, when blood multiplies in them, so that they need its extraction through cupping, experience heaviness and headache in their head.
And some of them experience fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
And some of them experience itching on their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the site of their cupping. And some of them experience increased laughter.
And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood.
And some of them experience increased sleep.
And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them. Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we then order a venesection to be performed, after two or three hours have passed during the day. The benefit of venesection of the nape of the neck is: because it contributes to the heaviness in the head, and that which is discharged to the eyes.
