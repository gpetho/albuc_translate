of the discharge from the eye
When the eye is completely open, and there is no disturbance or lessening to the nose/nerve, then you must tie the patient;
then bleed him, then apply cupping glasses or a tube without lancing to suck, then put on the eye a plaster made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then constrict the eye, and the plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the method with the cloths is that you take fairly soft cloths, and fold each one in four, and then place one on top of the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then tighten over it with a very hard bandage, and repeat the cupping glasses to suck without lancing;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye constricted day and night, and if the plaster softens, then you must tighten it a lot;
then remove the plaster after a day and a night, and if you see the eye improving, that's good;
if not;
then repeat the plaster and the cloths and the bandage and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
