Chapter thirty-seven on cauterizing the kidneys.	CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN. On cauterization of the kidneys.	0.8626591
If there occurs in the kidneys pain from cold or thick wind, and because of that the sick person's intercourse diminishes then it is necessary to cauterize him on the buttocks, on the location of the kidneys, a cauterization on each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery iron that was mentioned before.	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before.	0.7607821
And perhaps we cauterize him a third time at the same sitting, resulting in three cauterizations lined up, so it is more effective in benefit.	I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.64228225
