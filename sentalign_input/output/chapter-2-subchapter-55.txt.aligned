Of the obstruction of the penis Sometimes children are born without a hole in the penis, or the hole is small, or it is not in the right place. So it is necessary to immediately pierce it with a very fine spatula in this form: then place a fine lead nail in the hole, and tie it and leave it for three or four days and when he wants to urinate, the nail is removed, and he urinates, and then it is replaced; and perhaps it is not needed because the urine that comes out will not let it close. Those whose hole is small are treated with the lead nail, as we have said, and it will enlarge. Those who do not have the hole in the right place are injured, because some are born with the hole at the top of the penis, so they cannot urinate unless they lift their penis high; and they cannot impregnate because the semen cannot reach the womb, and this is a bad condition.	When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back. If you do not put in the leaden sound it may be that the urine passing through the place will prevent the wound from healing. The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough. In those cases having a misplaced meatusâ€”for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.	0.8311015
And the procedure is that the patient should lie often on his back, then stretch the tip of the penis and cut it like the shape of a pen, so that the hole is in the middle, as it should be; and be careful of bleeding which often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.	The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should. And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.	0.7963696
