When the artery is cut
Often there are large flows of blood from the artery that is cut in a wound that occurs superficially, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cauterization of a limb, and similar things;
and it is very difficult to stop.
And nevertheless when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press very hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and no more drops come out;
then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red-hot;
then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you are holding your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another one of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not stop doing this one after the other until the blood is stanched;
and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be easily stopped, especially when the artery is large, except by one of the four methods that we have described:
either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not cut, or by tight tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood;
and it should be tied and tightly bound.
Whoever attempts to stop the bleeding by tightly binding cloths or by putting burning things on it, or other similar things, will achieve little benefit.
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a doctor or medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until the bleeding is stopped above the wound and above the vein; 
and do not remove the finger, but wet it often with cold water, very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and then do what is necessary with cauteries and medicines.
