Chapter XXV
On the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated inward due to its connection with the chest; but sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is felt by touch.
The reduction is done by having the patient lie on their back and extend their arms.
Then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return to place.
Then apply a plaster and powder to the area and bind it tightly.
But the extremity that follows the elbow and is connected to it is not easily dislocated; when it is, it must be reduced and aligned as previously described and according to the method prepared.
Then apply a plaster, powder, and binding, and instruct the patient to remain tranquil and at rest until it is healed.
And the same treatment is applied to the muscle extremity when it is separated from its place.
