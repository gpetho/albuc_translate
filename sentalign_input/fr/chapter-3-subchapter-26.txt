Of the dislocation of the shoulder  
Know that the shoulder can only dislocate in three ways: one is dislocation downwards towards the armpit; the second is towards the chest; and sometimes upwards, but this happens rarely.  
And it does not dislocate backwards through the shoulder, nor internally through the nerves; it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in these it quickly dislocates; in those who have enough flesh, it dislocates with difficulty and returns with difficulty.  
And sometimes, due to impact or fracture, the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and it is thought to be dislocated because of this.  
Therefore, it is necessary to examine it to be sure; and then begin the treatment.  
The dislocation is recognized when it is downwards towards the armpit, and by the difference between the sick shoulder and the healthy one, which will be manifest.  
And you will find a depression at the head of the shoulder, and below the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose or make any movements.  
And also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you will find it manifestly by touch.  
And this type of dislocation is not difficult to reduce when it is recent, or if the child is young.  
The method is for the assistant to lift the patient's arm upwards, then place your thumbs under the armpit, and lift the joint forcefully upwards into place; and the assistant lifts the arm, and extends it upwards, then places it below; so it will come back quickly.  
And if it does not come back as we have said after several days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and administer soothing and softening baths, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and let it be administered.  
Then let the patient lie on his back, and place a woolen pad under the armpit, neither too soft nor too hard, then the practitioner places his heel on the pad, and virtuously lifts the head of the shoulder, and pulls the patient's hand.  
And another assistant holds the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you want, reduce it according to this method.  
And have present a man who is taller than the patient; and let him stand to the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air.  
And another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards the abdomen. And if the patient is too light, let something heavy be hung with him, and the dislocation will return immediately.  
And reduce it also in another manner: which is to drive a long stick into the ground, with the head as round as a pestle, and not too thick nor too thin.  
Then place it under the patient, but let it have soft cloths on it, and the patient stands along the stick; then extend his hand down strongly from the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly.  
And if it does not return despite all these methods we have mentioned, then do this treatment: take a stick two arms long and four fingers wide, with a round head to fit deeply under the armpit, in this shape:  
Then wrap soft cloths around the head of the stick, so it does not hurt the patient, then place it under the patientâ€™s armpit; and extend his arm along the stick, and tie the joint onto the stick, and the arm at the hand's head, then place the arm on a rung of a wide ladder, and extend the hand down, and let the body hang from the other side: the joint will return immediately.  
And when it is in place, by whatever method, it is necessary to place an equal wool pad under the armpit, then apply a plaster made of mill dust, incense, and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around, then bandage appropriately under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and brace the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain like this.  
And it is necessary for him to eat little, so that the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster; and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.  
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come, or for another reason, it is necessary to apply cauterization at three points, as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.  
And if you do all this, and it dislocates again after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot lift his arm up, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut, stretched, or softened; and know that the joint will never be firmly set in place.  
The dislocation towards the chest, and the nipples, or behind, is caused by an impact, and extending the hands, and it is treated in another way; and treated until it is healed.  
And if after healing stiffness comes to the limb, and delay in movement, let the patient use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
