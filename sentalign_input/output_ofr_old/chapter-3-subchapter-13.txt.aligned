Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, fractures rarely occur, and there is usually only swelling.	Fractures of the metacarpus and of the small bones of the fingers very rarely occur; the only frequent occurrence is contusion.	0.7020008
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or swollen, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit straight and evenly before him; then place his hand on the stretched towel, and the practitioner extends the broken bones, and sets them evenly together, so that they are well joined; and apply the plaster and the padding, if no abscess develops, then put a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.	When a fracture or crushing of the palm of the hand occurs the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of the right height in front of him, on which he should put his outstretched hand. Then an assistant is to extend the broken bones while the doctor straightens them so as to achieve a proper union. Then a plaster and a dressing should be applied, if an effusion do not occur; then a splint over that, measured to the site and wrapped in a soft cloth.	0.8799385
And if the fracture is inside, around the belly of the palm, make a ball of cloths, and instruct the patient to squeeze it against his fractured palm; and then tighten it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather, as large as the palm of the hand, and tighten it as needed.	If the fracture be lower down, near the inner part of the palm of the hand, make a ball of cloth, bid the patient grip on it with the fractured palm of his hand, and then bind it up with a long bandage. The splint should be of leather that is somewhat soft, so as to fit into all the folds of the palm; and bandage it on suitably.	0.8564006
And if the fracture is outside, you must put a splint on top, and another underneath in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then tie it all around the hand, and tighten the bond between the fingers.	But if the fracture be on the outside you will have to put one splint above and another beneath the palm of the hand, to keep the hand opened and straight; then put on the bandage, carrying it round the hand and in and out between the fingers.	0.8819181
