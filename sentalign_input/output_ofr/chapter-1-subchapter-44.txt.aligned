of the pain of the joints	On cauterization of gout and pain in the joints.	0.5294833
When joint pain is from moistures that are spread to each limb of the body, and when the pain comes in the feet, which physicians properly call "podagra" (gout), and when it is from a cold cause and medicinal treatments cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in this way: make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form: And if it is necessary that you prick on the surface of the foot, then make a cautery with the entire cautery that is called "point". (or "pointed")	When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'. When gout due to chill has been treated with the various treatments mentioned in its section, and the pains remain, the cautery will remove them. That is, you cauterize the patient with multiple burns around the joint of the foot, after he has been purged. The cautery should be a middle-sized olivary one, thus.	0.77630365
And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens often, make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each side, with the olive-shaped cautery; and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than it takes for the thickness of the skin to be burned.	If you need to make punctate cauterizations round the front of the foot, use the punctate cautery; and if the pains go up to the knee or other joints, which often happens, burn each knee with three or four cauterizations on every side with the same olivary cautery. And if you require to cauterize him more than this, do it, but do not go deeply but only about the thickness of the skin.	0.85335016
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.	If the pains go up to the hip joints or the back, employ those cauterizations that we have mentioned in their own chapter.	0.7839112
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist in two lines; and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the back of the hand; and if the pains reach the elbows or up to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and ensure the patient has good care and takes medicines.	And if the pains are in the hands only, pierce a double line all around the wrists. If the pains remain in the fingers, pierce them once over each joint and once on the metacarpus. And if after some days the pains go up to the elbows or shoulders then cauterize both on each side.	0.8356905
For if you give him good care and you purge the phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.	And keep the patient to good habits and taking of medicine; for if his regimen be good and the phlegm got rid of, he will be cured with this cautery.	0.53873956
