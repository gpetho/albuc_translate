On the softening of the covering of the testicles.	On the loosening of the skin of the scrotum.	0.8191795
Sometimes the covering of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between it is softened, and its care is unpleasant.	In some men there often occurs a loosening of the skin of the scrotum without any loosening of the organs within. This has a horrible appearance.	0.59844023
Then it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the covering that is softened over the natural covering; then join the two edges with the suture.	He who desires to treat this condition should make the patient lie on his back; and he should cut away all the loose skin that is over and above the normal. Then he should bring together the two edges of the incision with a suture.	0.83301514
And if you want, sew at the beginning the excess of the softened covering with three or four stitches and a firm suture.	Or, if you prefer, first suture the excess of loose skin together, with three or four stitches, and make the suture firm.	0.84842944
Then cut between the sutures; and then treat it as with other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall off.	Then cut away what is taken up between the stitches. Then dress the wound with the usual dressings till it heals and the stitches come away.	0.76962197
